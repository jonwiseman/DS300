Many believed such an attempt would be a \"red line\" that would lead to impeachment. So what do we do now? I analyze that question and what this news means here.\n\n>**1/** First, here's the NYT story. The upshot is that last June Donald Trump *ordered* White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Bob Mueller. McGahn refused and threatened to quit if Trump went forward with the firing. Ultimately, Trump relented.\n\n>**2/** Some will wonder why McGahn had enough sway with Trump to stop this from happening. That's a very good question to ask. First, note that McGahn was the attorney from Trump's winning presidential campaign, so the two have known each other and worked together for some time now.\n\n>**3/** Next, we have to remember that McGahn is a potential witness\u2014and, importantly, a potential witness *against Trump*\u2014in the Trump-Russia investigation. McGahn was present at nearly all the key moments in the Obstruction fact-pattern that Mueller is considering referring to DOJ.\n\n>**4/** If Mueller refers an Obstruction indictment to DOJ, DOJ will likely refer it to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration for articles of impeachment\u2014and whether or not such articles come out of that committee, America already knows Obstruction is an impeachable offense.\n\n>**5/** It's an impeachable offense because it already was for Bill Clinton\u2014per the Republican Party and its votes on impeachment in the House. So while Trump may only have had an inkling of this last June, he likely knew enough to see that McGahn was someone whose loyalty he needed.\n\n>**6/** McGahn is protected from ever testifying against Donald Trump on some issues\u2014but *not* if the conduct he is to be questioned about involves criminal conduct by the president. Remember that Don McGahn does *not* represent Donald Trump, he represents the Office of the President.\n\n>**7/** Definitionally and legally, criminal conduct is not considered within the recognized duties of a president, which means McGahn's role as an attorney for the Office of the President diverges from Trump's own legal interests as and when the president has acted illegally\u2014as here.\n\n>**8/** McGahn was present before and after the Comey firing, as Trump concocted pretexts for that illegal action and then\u2014afterward\u2014a coverup for what was a *Russia-based* decision to dump Comey. That decision was illegal for the previously cited reason about the office of president.\n\n>**9/** No constitutional provision or U.S. statute ever has\u2014or ever could\u2014authorize POTUS to commit a crime. This means that while Trump *is* allowed to fire Comey because, say, he doesn't like Comey's dress sense, he's *not* allowed to fire him to obstruct a criminal investigation.\n\n>**10/** So McGahn can rather readily be used as an Obstruction witness against Trump, not just because of the Comey firing but much else\u2014for instance attempts to pressure Congressional investigators to drop their probes or attempts to pressure Jeff Sessions into not recusing himself.\n\n>**11/** Trump was represented by Marc Kasowitz last June, and either Trump or Kasowitz would have sussed out that if Don McGahn quit the White House because he believed Trump was about to commit a *crime*\u2014and make no mistake, that'd pretty much be the basis\u2014it would be a catastrophe.\n\n>**12/** The firing itself would be a catastrophe politically, but if it occurred concurrent to McGahn quitting, the chances that McGahn would be drawn even further into the investigation as a witness against Trump would be *extremely* high. And we don't know what *else* McGahn knows.\n\n>**13/** Here's the problem: Trump didn't back off from firing Mueller because he decided it was wrong or outside his authority or\u2014better still\u2014a federal crime. \n\n>This is a *critical* point: the NYT establishes Trump *only* relented to keep McGahn from quitting as White House Counsel.\n\n>**14/** Indeed, there wouldn't have been any story for the NYT to report\u2014this would likely never have leaked\u2014if Trump had simply gone to McGahn for legal advice about firing Mueller, and McGahn had advised him not to do so, and Trump immediately relented in the face of such advice.\n\n>**15/** Rather, the NYT says that\u2014either on his own counsel or someone else's\u2014Donald Trump *ordered* McGahn to do something. He did *not* ask for his advice, he *ordered* him to fire Mueller. (It may have been Kasowitz's doing, as Kasowitz was urging Trump to go to war with Mueller.)\n\n>**16/** So what we know now is Trump had the criminal intent\u2014mens rea\u2014to Obstruct by firing his *second* person who was then investigating him, but no crime occurred because there was no actus reus (no act). The only reason there was no act was a key witness threatening to jump ship.\n\n>**17/** So Trump thinks he has the *authority* to fire Mueller, that doing so is *appropriate* and *warranted*, and he has the *willingness* to do so. Also (lest we forget) he has the willingness to *lie* about wanting to fire Mueller\u2014as he's now been lying about it for seven months.\n\n>**18/** When many many analysts, me included, were saying after Mueller's appointment that he needed to be protected ASAP from Trump firing him\u2014because we said that that attempt *would* be made\u2014such concerns were dismissed as conspiracy theory and the bill to protect Mueller stalled.\n\n>**19/** One effect of this breaking news therefore must be immediate passage of the bill to protect Mueller that was *only* not passed previously because the GOP told America\u2014and they were dead wrong\u2014that this president never had and would never have any intention of firing Mueller.\n\n>**20/** But it's more than that: Trump was willing to fire Mueller when his level of legal jeopardy was unclear, and Mueller had brought *no* indictments and secured *no* cooperation deals with top Trump national security aides. So what is Trump's temperature on firing Mueller *now*?\n\n>**CONCLUSION/** This is the last moment for Republicans to jump off the Trump ship in the eyes of history. Trump is the Titanic and the iceberg is *dead ahead*. He *will* try to fire Mueller\u2014a crime and impeachable as Obstruction. Congress must get on the right side of history *now*.\n\n>**NOTE/** There are other ancillary effects to this story: for instance, Bill Burck *must* now see that he needs to get the hell off two of the three cases he's currently working as attorney: Bannon, McGahn, and Priebus. Representing all three is no longer (really never was) tenable.\n"}, {"comment_id": "dt92age", "post_id": "7t12e6", "comment": "Eric Columbus\u200fVerified account \n@EricColumbus\n\nFollow Follow @EricColumbus\n\nMore Eric Columbus Retweeted Matthew Miller\n\n>Key point in tonight\u2019s NYT story: this isn\u2019t  Trump hatching a crazy plan and then changing his mind.

I know this comment is going to get lost in this thread, but go on a journey back to 2016 with me for a moment.\n\nThe Clinton email scandal is in full swing, everyone has picked their corners. But two *very important details* are oft ignored:\n\n* The first, slightly well known attribute of the scandal; most of the information on her servers was *retroactively classified,* which means she would not have had classified material on her servers at the time of sending and would not have been made aware of the retroactive action.\n\n* The second, less understood; as Secretary of State, Clinton was the Original Classification Authority (OCA) for the State Department. An OCA has complete dominion over the level of classification for information under their purview. In the case of Clinton, she had control of all State Department-owned information, and how it was classified. So when she sent the emails, she had total authority to designate whether the information was even classified *at all.*\n\nIvanka, on the other hand, is not an OCA. She has no classification authorities. If *any* of that information is classified, she's fucked and will need to rely on a pardon. Donald (I patronizingly call him DJ) is an OCA, but can't retroactively declassify the information to keep her safe. Also, that's why DJ could tell us about Area 51 with no consequences, or why he got away with casually sharing classified info with Russians in the West Wing.\n\nAs an aside, Comey was the OCA for FBI, which is why DJ's assertions that Comey's notes should be classified and he should be prosecuted went nowhere fast."}, {"comment_id": "ea2gt6w", "post_id": "9ymbzc", "comment": "Lock her up?

[In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money and it continued for decades](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html). In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.\n\n\u25ba In 1984, David Bogatin \u2014 a Russian mobster, convicted gasoline bootlegger, and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss \u2014 met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, [Apr 30, 1992](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html))\n\n\u25ba Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former \"fixer\" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.\n\n\u25ba Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.\n\n\u25ba Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years, that many of them have owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties, that they were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel. (Mogilevich's role today is unclear).\n\n\u25ba One of the most important things that is often overlooked is that the Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.\n\n\u25ba From Craig Unger's AMA: \"Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.\"\n\n\u25ba  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate). \n\n\u25ba According to a Bloomberg investigation ([March 16, 2017](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/behind-trump-s-russia-romance-there-s-a-tower-full-of-oligarchs)) into Trump World Tower, which broke ground in 1998, \u201ca third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.\u201d\n\n\u25ba Here is the most prominent example: In July 2008, the height of the recession, Donald Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value. \n\n\u25ba As an example of the Russian mob operating out of Trump Tower, in 2013, Federal agents busted an \u201cultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring\u201d run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. In addition to card games, they operated illegal gambling websites, ran a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a \u201csophisticated money-laundering scheme\u201d connected to Semion Mogilevich. \n\n\u25ba It has been widely known for decades that Russia often used videotaped \"honey traps\" to compromise influential visitors. General Oleg Kalugin, former head of counterintelligence for the KGB, told Craig Unger (Author, \"House of Trump, House of Putin\") they probably did this with Trump during his visit to Russia in 1987--long before the events in the Steele dossier. \"I can't tell what is inside Trump's mind, but everyone who traveled to Russia knew this.\"\n\n\u25ba  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive under his tenure in the Southern District and Mayor. And now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.\n\n\u25ba A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M [from Russia](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/148961/evidence-emerges-nras-russia-connection), then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. The big white shoe law firms--Jones Day, for example-- represent powerful Russian oligarchs who have billions and billions of dollars. Much of this is legal even though it appears to have compromised huge parts of the GOP. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. \n\n\u25ba At the Cityscape USA\u2019s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying \"...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\" \n\n\u25ba Eric Trump told James Dodson, a golf reporter, in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because \u201cWe don\u2019t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.\u201d\n\n\u25ba Trump's first wife, Ivana, was under surveillance by the STB, the Czech secret police, and they reported to the KGB. Ivana got out of Communist Czechoslovakia in the 70s which was not easy to do.\n\n\u25ba Regarding the Steele dossier, while not everything in the dossier has been corroborated, some of it has and none of it has been disproven. Christopher Steele has a terrific reputation in the intelligence world. For reference, Jeb Bush's opposition research included paying a US based intelligence firm (GPS Fusion), who reached out to Steele. This same intelligence firm was later hired by Clinton during her campaign. All of this was above-board and verifiable. \n\n\u25ba At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a [strong push](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/04/defying-history-moscow-moves-defend-soviet-war-afghanistan/?utm_term=.d077fc6cf274) for a resolution that would justify their country\u2019s 1979 invasion and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists\u2019 goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on [January 2nd](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-cracked-afghan-history-11546560234), Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n\u25ba We don't know who may be prosecuted with Deutsche Bank, but Russian money laundering is a huge part of this and how they compromised Trump. Trump was $4 billion in debt and the Russians [bailed him out](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/).

This isn\u2019t \u201cmaybe firing Comey is obstruction.\u201d This is directing someone to lie to Congress. Conspiracy and obstruction. Full stop.\n \nThe fact it\u2019s a lie to Congress puts him in deep deep water: Congress has no out. They must and will impeach. \n\nIt may happen before Feb 7, the date of Cohens testimony.

We believe political message reach should be earned, not bought. \n\n> Why? A few reasons: A political message earns reach when people decide to follow an account or retweet. Paying for reach removes that decision, forcing highly optimized and targeted political messages on people. We believe this decision should not be compromised by money. \n\n> While internet advertising is incredibly powerful and very effective for commercial advertisers, that power brings significant risks to politics, where it can be used to influence votes to affect the lives of millions. \n\n> Internet political ads present entirely new challenges to civic discourse: machine learning-based optimization of messaging and micro-targeting, unchecked misleading information, and deep fakes. All at increasing velocity, sophistication, and overwhelming scale. These challenges will affect ALL internet communication, not just political ads. Best to focus our efforts on the root problems, without the additional burden and complexity taking money brings. Trying to fix both means fixing neither well, and harms our credibility.  For instance, it's not credible for us to say: \u201cWe\u2019re working hard to stop people from gaming our systems to spread misleading info, buuut if someone pays us to target and force people to see their political ad\u2026well...they can say whatever they want! \n\n> We considered stopping only candidate ads, but issue ads present a way to circumvent. Additionally, it isn\u2019t fair for everyone but candidates to buy ads for issues they want to push. So we're stopping these too. \n\n> We\u2019re well aware we\u2018re a small part of a much larger political advertising ecosystem. Some might argue our actions today could favor incumbents. But we have witnessed many social movements reach massive scale without any political advertising. I trust this will only grow.  In addition, we need more forward-looking political ad regulation (very difficult to do). Ad transparency requirements are progress, but not enough. The internet provides entirely new capabilities, and regulators need to think past the present day to ensure a level playing field.  \n\n> We\u2019ll share the final policy by 11/15, including a few exceptions (ads in support of voter registration will still be allowed, for instance). We\u2019ll start enforcing our new policy on 11/22 to provide current advertisers a notice period before this change goes into effect. \n\n> A final note. This isn\u2019t about free expression. This is about paying for reach. And paying to increase the reach of political speech has significant ramifications that today\u2019s democratic infrastructure may not be prepared to handle. It\u2019s worth stepping back in order to address. \n\n\nI made some minor grammar edits (removed a couple of emojis, separated the thoughts into paragraphs, and fixed a syntax error), but left it largely untouched.\n\nMy own thoughts: This is fantastic news.  This is specifically influenced by the major missteps by Facebook, which is hilarious, but also important that he's acknowledging the problem and that there's no easy solution other than to outright ban until they can assess what the specific measurable impacts are.  \n\nWe know that there\u2019s been some shady things happening on Facebook, and after the fallout caused by [Zuckerberg\u2019s hearing and vis a vis with AOC](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/the-technology-202/2019/10/24/the-technology-202-mark-zuckerberg-struggles-to-defend-facebook-s-civil-rights-record/5db0811f602ff10cf14f9700/), there\u2019s more of a shift towards protecting the constitution and the institution of democracy through honest campaigning.  The Washington Post makes a great deal of sense [here]( https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/28/pro-trump-super-pacs-draw-scrutiny-facebook-ads-seeking-voter-registration-data/):\n\n> Political campaigns have long seized on scare tactics to galvanize voters, bombarding them with direct mail or radio and television advertisements in a bid to get them to register, volunteer and cast ballots on Election Day. What makes Facebook different, experts say, are the tech giant\u2019s powerful tools for finding, targeting and engaging narrow communities. At times that capability has come with great controversy \u2014 such as the massive privacy breach linked to Cambridge Analytica, a political consultancy co-founded by onetime Trump adviser Stephen K. Bannon, that resulted in a record fine for Facebook.\n\n\nWhile it's not the be-all end-all for the decorum and policy of social media across the web, it's a promising start and quite literally the first domino in what will hopefully be more in the coming days, maybe weeks.  The real concern of course is Facebook, which has a demographic consisting mostly of 30-40 year olds -- those who were in their early teens or twenties when they started using the platform.  They do make up a big chunk of the user base, but the other part is the baby boomer's generation, which has some measurable impact on reactionary voting."}, {"comment_id": "f5ug065", "post_id": "dpckgv", "comment": "I bet Jack has watched Zuck be grilled in front of Congress and decided to cut his losses on that one.

This is true and a good distinction to make. \n\nBut do ads play a vital role in any social media environment. It's a crucial input to a Twitter page's discoverability and  visibility.

The Trump Administration is committed to energy policies that lower costs for hardworking Americans and maximize the use of American resources, freeing us from dependence on foreign oil.  \n  \nYou know what else would do that? Continuing progress on *clean energy* and working to make oil obsolete.  \n  \n>For too long, we\u2019ve been held back by burdensome regulations on our energy industry. President Trump is committed to eliminating harmful and unnecessary policies such as the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Lifting these restrictions will greatly help American workers, increasing wages by more than $30 billion over the next 7 years.  \n  \nThose \"burdensome regulations\" are there to protect public health and save lives. Eliminating these \"harmful policies\" will cause unimaginable harm to our people and planet.  \n  \n>Sound energy policy begins with the recognition that we have vast untapped domestic energy reserves right here in America. The Trump Administration will embrace the shale oil and gas revolution to bring jobs and prosperity to millions of Americans. We must take advantage of the estimated $50 trillion in untapped shale, oil, and natural gas reserves, especially those on federal lands that the American people own. We will use the revenues from energy production to rebuild our roads, schools, bridges and public infrastructure. Less expensive energy will be a big boost to American agriculture, as well.  \n  \nYes, let's get busy fracking all over the place. Nevermind all those earthquakes!  \n  \n>The Trump Administration is also committed to clean coal technology, and to reviving America\u2019s coal industry, which has been hurting for too long.  \n  \nCOAL ISN'T COMING BACK THIS IS A LIE LIE LIE.\n  \n>In addition to being good for our economy, boosting domestic energy production is in America\u2019s national security interest. President Trump is committed to achieving energy independence from the OPEC cartel and any nations hostile to our interests. At the same time, we will work with our Gulf allies to develop a positive energy relationship as part of our anti-terrorism strategy.  \n  \nWe can boost domestic energy production AND move away from oil at the same time. In a few years China will be leading the clean energy revolution, making massive profits selling their technology around the globe, while we're sitting here in the old USofA, finding new and better ways to suck dead dinosaur juice out of the ground while more and more people are dying from cancer.  \n  \n>Lastly, our need for energy must go hand-in-hand with responsible stewardship of the environment. Protecting clean air and clean water, conserving our natural habitats, and preserving our natural reserves and resources will remain a high priority. President Trump will refocus the EPA on its essential mission of protecting our air and water.  \n  \nBWAHAHAHAHA OMG WTF all of THAT above talking about scrapping regulations which aim to improve our air and water quality and then THIS? **REFOCUS THE EPA???** FFS, how? By putting in charge a bought-and-paid-for shill for the fossil fuel industry? A man who only recently grudgingly stated that he kinda thinks climate change might be a thing maybe but he's not even sure if humans really have much to do with it. A man who as Oklahoma AG, has sued the EPA repeatedly over, among other things, laws requiring lower mercury emissions from power plants. Seriously?  \n  \n>A brighter future depends on energy policies that stimulate our economy, ensure our security, and protect our health. Under the Trump Administration\u2019s energy policies, that future can become a reality.  \n\nThese policies will do none of the above. Our economy will stagnate and fall behind as the rest of the world gets over its addiction to oil. Our security will suffer as climate change accelerates - our own military has said as much. And our health, fuck me... Destroying regulations which are intended to reduce pollution and hold accountable those who spew toxic waste into the water and air will have no positive effects on the health of Americans.

Mandate that states must provide for *FREE* one of those I.D's.\n* Abolish the right of states to remove people from voter rolls for not voting in a previous election. Establish a minimum window of no less than 12 years (there is a valid reason to remove non-voters because frequently they have moved or have died). \n* Establish stringent requirements for electronic voting machines, including a paper record and forbidding them from being connected to each other or the internet to curtail hacking. \n\nYou might notice that online voting is not among these suggestions. Because it opens up elections to wholesale theft by hacking and it definitely would happen.

(I'm a bot)\n*****\n> WASHINGTON - Days before the Federal Communications Commission will vote on its proposed rollback of Net Neutrality rules that protect the open internet, Representative Sean Patrick Maloney introduced the Save Net Neutrality Act to stop the FCC&#039;s Notice of Proposed Rulemaking that would result in a final rule eliminating the existing Net Neutrality policy.\n\n> The FCC offered an NPRM on May 18, 2017 which would rollback Net Neutrality rules established by the Commission in 2015.\n\n> The Save Net Neutrality Act would simply prevent the FCC from relying on the NPRM process that will conclude with a final vote on December 14th. The bill refrains from making policy prescriptions, but instead invalidates the process that culminates in the creation of an enforceable rule authorized by the APA. Without the ability to rely on the rule, the FCC would have to start the NPRM process over from scratch.\n\n\n*****\n[**Extended Summary**](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/7iocgg/maloney_introduces_legislation_to_save_the_open/) | [FAQ](http://np.reddit.com/r/autotldr/comments/31b9fm/faq_autotldr_bot/ \"Version 1.65, ~262580 tl;drs so far.\") | [Feedback](http://np.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23autotldr \"PM's and comments are monitored, constructive feedback is welcome.\") | *Top* *keywords*: **rule**^#1 **Neutrality**^#2 **Net**^#3 **FCC**^#4 **process**^#5"}, {"comment_id": "dr0cvg2", "post_id": "7inuet", "comment": "**Republicans Vs Democrats on Net Neutrality **\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[House Vote for Net Neutrality](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h252)**\n\n&nbsp;|For|Against \n   -|-|-\n**Rep**|&nbsp;&nbsp;2|**234**\n**Dem**|**177**|&nbsp;&nbsp;6\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Senate Vote for Net Neutrality](https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/s200)**\n\n&nbsp;|For|Against \n   -|-|-\n**Rep**|&nbsp;&nbsp;0|&nbsp;&nbsp;**46**\n**Dem** |**52**|&nbsp;&nbsp;0\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOther:\n\n**[Sets reasonable limits on the raising and spending of money by electoral candidates to influence elections](http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/49906)** (Reverse Citizens United)\n\n&nbsp;|For|Against \n   -|-|-\n**Rep**|&nbsp;&nbsp;0|**42**\n**Dem** |**54**|&nbsp;&nbsp;0\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Campaign Finance Disclosure Requirements](http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/32154)**\n\n&nbsp;|For|Against \n   -|-|-\n**Rep**|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0|**39**\n**Dem**|**59**|&nbsp;&nbsp;0 \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[DISCLOSE Act](http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41152)**\n\n&nbsp;|For|Against \n   -|-|-\n**Rep**|&nbsp;&nbsp;0|**53**\n**Dem**|**45**|&nbsp;&nbsp;0\n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act](http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2002/roll034.xml)**\n\n&nbsp;|For|Against \n   -|-|-\n**Rep**|8|**38**\n**Dem**|**51**|3 \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Repeal Taxpayer Financing of Presidential Election Campaigns](https://votesmart.org/bill/votes/37426)**\n\n&nbsp;|For|Against \n   -|-|-\n**Rep**|**232**|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 \n**Dem**|&nbsp;&nbsp;0|**189** \n\n&nbsp;\n\n**[Backup Paper Ballots -

As a point of departure, the Court notes that many statements of the principle that \"a sitting President cannot be indicted or criminally prosecuted\" typically cite to the DOJ Memos as the sole authority for that proposition. Accordingly, the theory has gained a certain degree of axiomatic acceptance, and the DOJ Memos which propagate it have assumed substantial legal force as if their conclusion were inscribed on constitutional tablets so-etched by the Supreme Court.  The Court considers such popular currency for the categorical concept and its legal support as not warranted.\n\n>Because arguments the President advances are so substantially grounded on the supposed constitutional doctrine and rationale the DOJ Memos present, a close review of the DOJ Memos is called for. On such assessment, the Court rejects the DOJ Memos' positions.  It concludes that better-calibrated alternatives to absolute presidential immunity exist yielding a more appropriate balance between, one the one hand, burdens that subjecting the President to criminal proceedings would impose on his ability to perform constitutional duties, and, on the other, the need to promote the courts' legitimate interests and functions ensuring effective law enforcement attendant to the proper and fair administration of justice.\n\n-pg 46-47, https://games-cdn.washingtonpost.com/notes/prod/default/documents/d3964ebc-adb2-4ff9-9364-9fda4b4ae025/note/9c4663de-c5c5-495e-ace4-757acc13e0de.pdf#page=1\n\n---\nJust go read the ruling.

Just because Cohen broke that law doesn\u2019t mean anyone else did.\n\nThat's from Andy Grewal, one of the Twitter pundits quoted in the article. \n\nLet me ask: \n\nWhy in the world would you lie about and conceal your illegal actions - both during and after the fact - if you didn't know they were illegal?\n\nHmmm...?\n\nEDIT: Grewal is right. Evidenced by this 2012 case:\n\nFinal Jury Instruction from The United States District Court for The Middle District of North Carolina:\n\nUnited States VS Johnny Reid Edwards\n\nCampaign Finance Crimes; 2008 Federal Cycle [Presidential Candidate (D.)]\n\nFiled 05/18/2012\n\nhttp://images.politico.com/global/2012/05/edwardsjuryinst.pdf\n\n> Page 11-12\n\n>In determining whether Mr. Edwards acted knowingly, you may consider whether he deliberately closed his eyes to what would otherwise have been obvious to him. If you find beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Edwards acted with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the truth\u2014here, the truth about the details of the money Mr. Young obtained from Ms. Mellon\u2014and not because he was merely negligent, foolish, or mistaken, the element that Mr. Edwards acted knowingly may be satisfied. I want to caution you, however, that the element of willfulness cannot be satisfied in this manner. If you find that Mr. Edwards was aware of a high probability of certain facts and that he acted with deliberate disregard of those facts, then you may find that he acted knowingly. If, however, you find that he actually believed that the facts were not true, you may not find that he acted knowingly with respect to those facts. And, to repeat, this kind of evidence is not sufficient to prove willfulness; willfulness requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Edwards acted with knowledge that his course of conduct was unlawful.\n\nSo the way this reads, Grewal is right. Ignorance to the fact it was a crime IS a valid defense, according to this court at least. \"Willfully\" is the element we're concerning ourselves with. \n\n> And, to repeat, this kind of evidence is not sufficient to prove willfulness; willfulness requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Edwards acted with knowledge that his course of conduct was unlawful.\n\nThat doesn't change the fact that there is likely sufficient evidence to suggest his state of mind when making the decision to direct Cohen. \n\nThis, from the introduction to the same instructions, page 4:\n\n> In deciding what someone intended at any particular time, you may consider any statements made or acts done or not done by that person and all other facts and circumstances surrounding the events at issue in deciding what a person\u2019s intent, motive, or purpose was. You may decide, but are not required to decide, that a person intends the natural and likely consequences of acts done knowingly or acts knowingly omitted.\n\nTrump himself has effectively said that if the payments were made from the campaign they'd likely constitute a crime, in the same interview he said the payments occured but \"it wasn't campaign money.\"\n\nAgain, from the same jury instructions, Page 10:\n> The government does not have to prove that the contribution was received by the campaign itself. The government does not have to prove that Mr. Edwards himself personally accepted or received the money, though of course that would be sufficient. It would also be sufficient, however, if the government proves beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Edwards willfully caused another person to accept or receive the contribution on his behalf. As a general rule, whoever willfully causes an act to be done that, if directly performed by him would be a crime, is treated as if he had committed the crime directly himself. So Mr. Edwards had to have knowledge of what his agent was doing, in relevant part though not necessarily as to every detail, and he had to have knowledge of the donor\u2019s purpose. In other words, if Mr. Edwards willfully caused the acts or conduct of another by willfully ordering, directing, commanding, inducing, or authorizing the other person\u2019s conduct, the law holds him responsible for that conduct just as if it had been personally done by him.\n\nSo it would seem a jury could, even should, conclude he intended to break the law since he was aware of it's illegality and directed Cohen in such a manner. No matter where the money originated. \n\nThis article (https://www.vox.com/2018/8/22/17770074/fox-and-friends-trump-cohen-campaign-finance-payment) referring to a F&F's interview with Trump admitting the payments were made and discussing how they were made.\n\nIt's remarkable how much of this case parallels what's happening now.

This means they will have the co-operation of Trump's *own employees* for providing evidence against him. \n\n(2) They very likely *already have* a lot of the documents of importance to the case, so people at Trump org. will be working under threat of indictment for lying to federal investigators if they intentionally fail to produce or destroy evidence for Trump. \n\n(3) This is a files and data case; it sounds like issued subpoenas are for documents, not witnesses - although it could be both, and if Trump has been associating with shady Russian figures for some time then that will show in records obtained from Trump Org. staff. However anything Trump gets charged with based on these financial records is more or less set in stone, there's no ambiguity of \"he said this\" or \"he didn't say this\" from conflicting witness testimony. Everything is on paper, and if he (AND his children) laundered money through Trump org. that will be shown here. \n\nThe question remaining is: What did Mueller request? Without a copy of the Subpoena we have no way of knowing what he's asked for. Hopefully it will be publicly available soon and then we will know more.\n\nBUT, the subpoena might list the names of people of interest with ties to the Trump association (since they probably requested all Trump org. e-mails, faxes, financial documents and maybe even phone records that have any ties to those people), and that will give us a much better picture of just how broad the scope of the crimes being investigated is and *who* the major players that we don't already know about are. It's possible (I dare say likely) Trump has been associating with international criminals for some time and there will undoubtedly be financial documents and communications records about (a) The laundering of money out of Kazakhstan (b) Trump tower Moscow; (c) the Trump Soho allegedly used to launder money that implicates Ivanka; and - probably - a lot of other alleged criminal activities).\n\nOverall, a this is a VERY bad sign for Trump.

For example, look at Super PACs. They aren't supposed to coordinate with candidates, but how is that possible to prevent. If nothing else, a Super PAC could just spend money copying what a candidate does (the only difference is a slight lag between when the side does something and the other follows up with a copy).\n\n* Candidate says a catch phrase. Super PAC throws it on signs.\n\n* Candidate makes a TV ad.

Now you need a wealth tax. Now you want to make these other investments.\u2019 ... I think going straight up the middle on the corruption plan is the first one. Knock them back, and while they\u2019re all scrambling, then start passing the rest of it.\u201d\n\n-----\n\n> Warren\u2019s most recent anti-corruption plan contains nearly 100 proposals to change how lobbying works in all three branches of government: executive, legislative, and judicial. It\u2019s modeled after the Anti-Corruption and Public Integrity Act she introduced last summer, but contains some major changes.\n\n> Here are key points of Warren\u2019s plan:\n\n> * A lifetime lobbying ban for presidents, vice presidents, members of Congress, federal judges, and Cabinet secretaries.\n\n> * conflict of interest laws to the president and vice president, requiring them to place businesses into a blind trust to be sold off. They would also have to place assets that could present a conflict of interest \u2014 including real estate \u2014 in a blind trust and sell them off.\n\n> * Multi-year lobbying bans for federal employees (both Congressional staffers and employees of federal agencies). The span of time would be least two years, and six years for those wishing to become corporate lobbyists.\n\n> * Banning members of Congress and senior congressional staff from serving on corporate boards. The plan would also ban senior administration officials and members of Congress from serving on for-profit boards, no matter if they receive compensation for it or not.\n\n> * Ban lobbyists from all fundraising activities including hosting political fundraisers or campaign bundling, and strengthen criminal anti-corruption statutes by redefining an \u201cofficial act\u201d to make politicians unable to accept gifts or payments in exchange for government action.\n\n> * Requiring the IRS to release eight years\u2019 worth of tax returns for all presidential and vice presidential candidates, as well as requiring them to release tax returns during each year in office. The IRS would also have to release two years\u2019 worth of tax returns for members of Congress, and require them to release tax returns for each lawmaker\u2019s year in office.\n\n> * Banning members of Congress, Cabinet secretaries, federal judges, White House staff, senior congressional staff, and other officials from owning or trading individual stocks while in office.\n\n> * Changing the rulemaking process of federal agencies to severely restrict the ability of corporations or industry to delay or influence rulemaking. Warren\u2019s plan would restrict studies funded by groups with conflict-of-interest problems being considered in the rulemaking process, unless they go under a lengthy peer review.\n\n> * Broadening the definition of a \u201cthing of value\u201d in campaign finance laws to go beyond money. Under the new definition, it could include opposition research from foreign governments.\n\n> * Creating a new independent US Office of Public Integrity, which would enforce the nation\u2019s ethics laws, and investigate any potential violations. The office would also try to strengthen open records laws, making records more easily accessible to the public and the press.\n\n> * Banning forced arbitration clauses and class action waivers for all employment, consumer protection, antitrust, and civil rights cases.\n\n> * Boosting transparency in certain court cases by prohibiting courts from using sealed settlements to conceal evidence in cases that involve public health or safety."}, {"comment_id": "f0kdyp4", "post_id": "d53xzz", "comment": "Yea, fuck that.

The math is permanently stacked against such.

However, after taking two weeks off from a marathon of sessions, they reflected upon their decision and worried the president would be too beholden to the legislature. So, they created a \u201cshadow congress\u201d in equal proportions as the actual one with the sole purposes of choosing the president and declaring themselves as a body to be dissolved.\n\nNow, two centuries of parliamentary theory later have shown the \u201ctoo beholden\u201d-ness about which the Framers worried is actually a good thing.

The public doesn't care about these Washington \"process\" stories, and we should get back to what really matters.\n4. Trump is an outsider and inexperienced. This, the Comey firing and the \"inadvertent disclosure\" to the Russians yesterday are products of incompetence and nothing more.\n5. Why didn't Comey resign when this conversation allegedly happened? Maybe he wasn't acting honorably, wanted to hold on to his job. Why is this only coming out now?\n\n*The answer to (5) is clear. According to NYT article, the individuals who leaked the memo in response to taped conversation tweet - they feel that tapes will vindicate the memo.*\n\n6. Tucker Carlson is a moron. This is all a big conspiracy between the MSM and the \"leakers\" who simply don't like the President. I gotta stop, this is making my brain bleed. Oh, the Russians aren't that bad. Suddenly, the Russians are bad, and it all happened during a single election cycle. \n\n*Looks as like Tucker slept through the whole Crimea business, or Obama's frosty relationship with Moscow.*\n\nMost interesting is that 50 minutes into the broadcast, FNC can't find a *single* GOP Senator or Congressman willing to go on the air to defend the President, or comment in any way.\n\nFNC Congressional correspondent has called \"countless\" offices, can't find anyone to go on the air. He's also saying that nobody is even willing to make a comment.\n\nIs the RNC ready to defect, or is this a result of Republicans sticking their neck out to defend him on Comey firing/disclosures and then getting burned by Trump's admissions tweets?\n\nEDIT: Apparently, they *really* don't want to talk about it, per /u/funk_addict: https://twitter.com/rachaelmbade/status/864608676740554752\n\nJim Risch (R-ID) https://www.risch.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/contact : Claims he was a former prosecutor, if someone tried to kill his investigation, he'd scream bloody murder about it. Why didn't he report it? There's too much reliance on private sources. It would be illegal for Comey not to report if he thought it was obstruction of justice.\n\nTrey Gowdy (R-SC) https://gowdy.house.gov/contact : It's not fair to be coming to conclusions without seeing the whole memo and getting context from Comey. He's open to a special prosecutor, but thinks DOJ can do the job just fine without one. Comey did not have to report, even if he thought the President was trying to influence an investigation.

And I think that's actually really indicative of what's actually going on right now Anderson, House lawmakers just came back tonight from 11 day recess, they've been out of town, for most of these bombshell developments over the course of the last week and a half, and as they were walking onto the House floor, even the most talkative of members? Not answering questions. Not responding. Not commenting at all. Several, starting to get, really conveniently timed phone calls. All to avoid reporters. Now, this is a shift. Usually House Republicans have been pretty steadfast in supporting the President. That changed, tonight. Now Anderson I texted one member whose been reliably defensive of the President, and asked, what's going on? Why's everybody avoiding the reporters right now. And he responded simply, because this looks *really bad*. I asked him if he thought this was a 'game changing moment', for the Congress, for Republican support, he said, we'll see, it's too early to tell and now I will tell you Anderson, David made a really good point. Everybody has eyes on right now, senior members of the Republican Party. The Chairman. The leadership. What they'll have to say, and we've got, one kind of break from the norm, House Oversight Government Chairman Jason Chaffetz, just sent a letter to the FBI requesting, any memoranda, notes, memos, or recordings, between, uh, that summarize the conversations between FBI Director James Comey, and the President, he said he needs a response to that by May 24th, he's also stated, that he's willing to subpoena.

If I had to guess, here is a short and long description of what I SUSPECT is going on,.\n\n**TL/DR**: The corruption we see is part of a late-stage plan using divide and conquer tactics to establish control of the world's assets from outside of any one country or government and concentrating these assets in the hands of a small group of oligarchs, including our \"emperor\". A part of Congress has already been co-opted and will not put this corruption in check because they have already been compromised by accepting money from a certain purveyor of mass murder.\n\nFor those 1-2 people with the patience or interest in bearing with me, here's a more detailed description:\n\nMy guess as to what t**he ULTIMATE end-game of this corruption** we see unfolding **is to de-stabilize the US so that:**\n\n1. **They can divide and conquer the largest economy in the world,** turning men against women, GOPs vs. Dems, every racial group against one another, straights against gays, every religion against others (and \"to the victor goes the spoils\")\n2. **They can siphon the assets from the enormous US economy and redirect them to the accomplices and cronies of our \"emperor\".**\n3. **A small group of nationalistic oligarchs from around the world** (including our \"emperor\") **can split the assets** they will have siphoned off of their respective governments **to generate untold wealth for THEMSELVES ALONE** at the expense of everyone else.\n   1. **Well before the shutdown**, you could walk through **MANY formerly bustling departments** of government and would have **found a ghost town, manned by a skeleton crew.** \n4. **The immense amount of initial wealth** they generate **can pay their way to infiltrate every system and part of government in a capitalistic society like ours and other democracies**  so as to perpetuate this madness well into the future--possibly forever.\n\n**This will allow them to** i**nstall themselves as rulers from outside of any one government or country for the long term, possibly forever** since their influence over the rest of the world's economies will allow them to siphon the wealth needed to maintain and perpetuate their stranglehold on the economies of the world.\n\n**They have already made progress on this by way of the organization that subsidizes mass murder which has co-opted the GOP-**\\-you know which organization I mean). This is how they have bought influence within a certain party to get them to aid and abet our \"emperor\" and not hold him accountable. (BTW, No party is above this kind of pernicious corruption)\n\n**For our emperor, it's a race against the clock** since he's not emperor for life so he's not staffing many departments, is dismantling programs and not enforcing lots of standard practices all **to redirect taxpayer money to his small circle of cronies on the inside and those on the outside who are helping him commit this crime** in full view of the public. But, he doesn't need to be in office for long to cause irreparable harm though.  In fact, **there is a good chance that barring something drastic happening soon, it may well be too late.**\n\nSorry to paint such a bleak picture but, that's what I draw from what I can see. You've been warned. **PLEASE, tell me where I'm probably wrong.** I don't want to be right about any of this.\n\nEdit: typo"}, {"comment_id": "edzzjny", "post_id": "afn2r2", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ee0ajqd", "post_id": "afn2r2", "comment": "Putin is very satisfied with how well it was executed too.

I wish I knew who it was so I could give them attribution.\n\n\nAnd before any of her sycophants or PR people can chime in:\n\n\n1. Impeachment will bring a lot of glossed over facts into the public eye, like Trump asking his lawyer to get rid of Mueller. Also Manafort giving polling data to Russians.\n2. Dems aren\u2019t doomed in 2020 if it fails. Clinton\u2019s acquittal in Feb 1999 was followed by Bush winning the presidency. Clinton didn\u2019t even get an approval bump after it.\n3. Trump\u2019s name needs to go on the list of impeached presidents. He\u2019s far worse than most. The narrative from people not paying attention will be \u201cif he\u2019s so bad why wasn\u2019t he impeached like Clinton?\u201d The majority of voters are not political news addicts. But they\u2019ll all hear the word \u201cimpeachment\u201d and some may decide to move on from all the smoke and chaos in their country when it\u2019s time to vote.\n4. Nixon had high approval ratings when impeachment talk started. The pretrial hearings brought out the facts to the public eye and everyone turned on him.\n5. Raising the likelihood of prosecution after he\u2019s out of office, or his children, may cause him to cut a deal to leave office.\n6. There\u2019s still a chance of conviction. People may turn on their senators once all the facts are blown up and a case is made. Nixon\u2019s impeachment talk started when he had high approval ratings.\n7. Barr\u2019s word shouldn\u2019t be the final say on this. He\u2019s proven to be a cover-up artist.\n8. It needs to be established that improper actions will be fought against to the fullest extent to deter future candidates from trying to steal elections.\n9. Impeachment will be open to other issues that Mueller\u2019s investigation was not like emoluments violations, conduct unbecoming of the presidency, tax violations, campaign finance violations, paying off pornstars to influence an election, wasting tax payer dollars on personal trips and benefiting financially from them, siding with Russia over US intelligence, separating families at the border, defrauding students at his university, ignoring Russia\u2019s attack on our elections, attacking the press, attacking members of the judicial and legislative branches in order to control them, etc.\n10. Trump uses lies, Fox News, and fake news. All that falls apart in a trial under oath. Get their damning testimonies on video and play clips around the clock. How many times have we seen Clinton\u2019s \u201cI did not have sexual relations with that woman\u201d?\n11. Impeachment may bring out more reason to examine his taxes and other financial documents.\n12. Trump already convinced his base that Mueller exonerated him and it didn\u2019t win over any Americans. A second \u201cexoneration\u201d will be meaningless. Everyone knows Republican senators won\u2019t convict. Put them all on record supporting the president with the lowest approval ratings in modern history after the damning facts have been laid out. Republican and Independent supporters of the rule of law will turn against them. It will also hurt any chances of a Presidential run for any senators that vote to acquit.\n13. Impeachment will be a game changer. It\u2019s a household word, and it has only happened twice before. People that normally don\u2019t pay attention will tune in just for the historical aspect. This will lead to greater support for impeachment as they learn the facts.\n\n\nPlease note: the list is not mine.

Not talking about the scandal here, I'm talking about things that were publicly known about Moore.  His statements about slavery.  His support for criminalizing homosexuality.  His actions that lead to his removal from public office, twice.  \n\nAnd finally, the scandal itself.

That\u2019s because OPEC needs big producers to help Saudi Arabia enforce oil production quotas. With Iran sidelined, Saudi Arabia alone can\u2019t convince the other smaller producers to hold back production and a hobbled OPEC can no longer bend the world oil market to its will. That is, unless Saudi Arabia gains the cooperation of another major producer, either Russia or Iran.\n\n>The changing economic realities that drove OPEC into Russia\u2019s arms handed Moscow considerable geopolitical benefits as the cartel\u2019s newfound linchpin.

Trump knew that at the time but he lied about it repeatedly. Insisted he had no business in Russia over and over. But Trump knew that he did.

In a call with Reporters, the senior Kremlin official who was managing the project put out a statement denying any Kremlin involvement. The Kremlin was helping cover this up too.\n\n>As a candidate, we now know, Trump was definitely compromised by Russia.

I am asking you today to join me as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least a million people from across the country.\n\nPlease join our campaign for president on day one and commit to doing what it takes to win this election.\n\nOur campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history. It is not only about winning the Democratic nomination and the general election.\n\nOur campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.\n\nOur campaign is about taking on the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life. I'm talking about Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial complex, the private-prison industry and the large multi-national corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives.\n\nOur campaign is about redoubling our efforts to end racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry and all forms of discrimination.\n\nOur campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country while we end voter suppression, Citizens United and outrageous levels of gerrymandering.\n\nOur campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many, not just the few. We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. We should not have grotesque levels of wealth inequality in which three billionaires own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.\n\nWe should not have 30 million Americans without any health insurance, even more who are under-insured and a nation in which life expectancy is actually in decline.\n\nWe should not have an economy in which tens of millions of workers earn starvation wages and half of older workers have no savings as they face retirement.\n\nWe should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth and a dysfunctional childcare system which is unfair to both working parents and their children.\n\nWe should not have a regressive tax system in which large, profitable corporations like Amazon pay nothing in federal income taxes.\n\nMake no mistake about it. The powerful special interests in this country have unbelievable power and they want to maintain the status quo. They have unlimited amounts of money to spend on campaigns and lobbying and have huge influence over the media and political parties.\n\nThe only way we will win this election and create a government and economy that works for all is with a grassroots movement \u2013 the likes of which has never been seen in American history.\n\nThey may have the money and power. We have the people. That is why we need one million Americans who will commit themselves to this campaign.\n\nStand with me as we fight to win the Democratic nomination and the general election. Add your name to join this campaign and say you are willing to do the hard work necessary to transform our country.\n\nYou know as well as I do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history. We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because, now more than ever, we need leadership that brings us together \u2013 not divides us up. Women and men, black, white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, young and old, native born and immigrant. Now is the time for us to stand together.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because we need leadership that will fight for working families and the shrinking middle class, not just the 1 percent. We need a president who understands that we can create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and construct the affordable housing we desperately need.\n\nI'm running for president because we need trade policies that reflect the interests of workers and not multi-national corporations. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, provide pay equity for women and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave.\n\nI'm running for president because we need to understand that artificial intelligence and robotics must benefit the needs of workers, not just corporate America and those who own that technology.\n\nI'm running for president because a great nation is judged not by how many billionaires and nuclear weapons it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable \u2013 the elderly, the children, our veterans, the sick and the poor.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because we need to make policy decisions based on science, not politics. We need a president who understands that climate change is real, is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet, and that we can generate massive job creation by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because the time is long overdue for the United States to join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare-for-all program.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because we need to take on the outrageous level of greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices in this country.\n\nI'm running for president because we need to have the best educated workforce in the world. It is totally counter-productive for our future that millions of Americans are carrying outrageous levels of student debt, while many others cannot afford the high cost of higher education. That is why we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower student debt.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because we must defend a woman\u2019s right to control her own body against massive political attacks taking place at the local state and federal level.\n\nI'm running for president because we need real criminal justice reform. We need to invest in jobs and education for our kids, not more jails and incarceration. We need to end the destructive \"war on drugs,\" eliminate private prisons and cash bail and bring about major police department reform.\n\nI'm running for president because we need to end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country and move to comprehensive immigration reform. We need to provide immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the DACA program and develop a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum.\n\nI'm running for president because we must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We need to take on the NRA, expand background checks, end the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons.\n\nI'm running for president because we need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, diplomacy and world peace. The United States must lead the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change, militarism, authoritarianism and global wealth inequality.\n\nThat is why we need at least a million people to join our campaign and help lead the movement that can accomplish these goals. Add your name to say we\u2019re in this together.\n\nNeedless to say, there is a lot of frightening and bad news in this world. Now, let me give you some very good news.\n\nThree years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were \"radical,\" and \"extreme.\" We were told that Medicare for All, a $15 an hour minimum wage, free tuition at public colleges and universities, aggressively combating climate change, demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes, were all of concepts that the American people would never accept.\n\nWell, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.\n\nTogether, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.\n\nSo here is my question for you:\n\nWill you stand with me as part of a million person grassroots movement which can not only win the Democratic primary, not only win the general election but most importantly help transform this country so that, finally, we have a government that works for all of us and not just the few? Add your name to say you will.\n\nTogether we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and for economic, racial, social and environmental justice.\n\nAnd together we can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country.\n\nBrothers and sisters, if we stand together, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.\n\nI hope you will join me.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nBernie Sanders"}, {"comment_id": "ehp0vo1", "post_id": "asac31", "comment": "I am not American.

I am asking you today to join me as part of an unprecedented and historic grassroots campaign that will begin with at least a million people from across the country.\n\nPlease join our campaign for president on day one and commit to doing what it takes to win this election.\n\nOur campaign is not only about defeating Donald Trump, the most dangerous president in modern American history. It is not only about winning the Democratic nomination and the general election.\n\nOur campaign is about transforming our country and creating a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice.\n\nOur campaign is about taking on the powerful special interests that dominate our economic and political life. I'm talking about Wall Street, the health insurance companies, the drug companies, the fossil fuel industry, the military-industrial complex, the private-prison industry and the large multi-national corporations that exert such an enormous influence over our lives.\n\nOur campaign is about redoubling our efforts to end racism, sexism, homophobia, religious bigotry and all forms of discrimination.\n\nOur campaign is about creating a vibrant democracy with the highest voter turnout of any major country while we end voter suppression, Citizens United and outrageous levels of gerrymandering.\n\nOur campaign is about creating a government and economy that works for the many, not just the few. We are the wealthiest nation in the history of the world. We should not have grotesque levels of wealth inequality in which three billionaires own more wealth than the bottom half of the country.\n\nWe should not have 30 million Americans without any health insurance, even more who are under-insured and a nation in which life expectancy is actually in decline.\n\nWe should not have an economy in which tens of millions of workers earn starvation wages and half of older workers have no savings as they face retirement.\n\nWe should not have the highest rate of childhood poverty of almost any major country on Earth and a dysfunctional childcare system which is unfair to both working parents and their children.\n\nWe should not have a regressive tax system in which large, profitable corporations like Amazon pay nothing in federal income taxes.\n\nMake no mistake about it. The powerful special interests in this country have unbelievable power and they want to maintain the status quo. They have unlimited amounts of money to spend on campaigns and lobbying and have huge influence over the media and political parties.\n\nThe only way we will win this election and create a government and economy that works for all is with a grassroots movement \u2013 the likes of which has never been seen in American history.\n\nThey may have the money and power. We have the people. That is why we need one million Americans who will commit themselves to this campaign.\n\nStand with me as we fight to win the Democratic nomination and the general election. Add your name to join this campaign and say you are willing to do the hard work necessary to transform our country.\n\nYou know as well as I do that we are living in a pivotal and dangerous moment in American history. We are running against a president who is a pathological liar, a fraud, a racist, a sexist, a xenophobe and someone who is undermining American democracy as he leads us in an authoritarian direction.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because, now more than ever, we need leadership that brings us together \u2013 not divides us up. Women and men, black, white, Latino, Native American, Asian American, gay and straight, young and old, native born and immigrant. Now is the time for us to stand together.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because we need leadership that will fight for working families and the shrinking middle class, not just the 1 percent. We need a president who understands that we can create millions of good-paying jobs, rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and construct the affordable housing we desperately need.\n\nI'm running for president because we need trade policies that reflect the interests of workers and not multi-national corporations. We need to raise the minimum wage to a living wage, provide pay equity for women and guarantee all workers paid family and medical leave.\n\nI'm running for president because we need to understand that artificial intelligence and robotics must benefit the needs of workers, not just corporate America and those who own that technology.\n\nI'm running for president because a great nation is judged not by how many billionaires and nuclear weapons it has, but by how it treats the most vulnerable \u2013 the elderly, the children, our veterans, the sick and the poor.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because we need to make policy decisions based on science, not politics. We need a president who understands that climate change is real, is an existential threat to our country and the entire planet, and that we can generate massive job creation by transforming our energy system away from fossil fuels to energy efficiency and sustainable energy.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because the time is long overdue for the United States to join every other major country on Earth and guarantee health care to all people as a right, not a privilege, through a Medicare-for-all program.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because we need to take on the outrageous level of greed of the pharmaceutical industry and lower prescription drug prices in this country.\n\nI'm running for president because we need to have the best educated workforce in the world. It is totally counter-productive for our future that millions of Americans are carrying outrageous levels of student debt, while many others cannot afford the high cost of higher education. That is why we need to make public colleges and universities tuition free and lower student debt.\n\nI\u2019m running for president because we must defend a woman\u2019s right to control her own body against massive political attacks taking place at the local state and federal level.\n\nI'm running for president because we need real criminal justice reform. We need to invest in jobs and education for our kids, not more jails and incarceration. We need to end the destructive \"war on drugs,\" eliminate private prisons and cash bail and bring about major police department reform.\n\nI'm running for president because we need to end the demonization of undocumented immigrants in this country and move to comprehensive immigration reform. We need to provide immediate legal status for the young people eligible for the DACA program and develop a humane policy for those at the border who seek asylum.\n\nI'm running for president because we must end the epidemic of gun violence in this country. We need to take on the NRA, expand background checks, end the gun show loophole and ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons.\n\nI'm running for president because we need a foreign policy which focuses on democracy, human rights, diplomacy and world peace. The United States must lead the world in improving international cooperation in the fight against climate change, militarism, authoritarianism and global wealth inequality.\n\nThat is why we need at least a million people to join our campaign and help lead the movement that can accomplish these goals. Add your name to say we\u2019re in this together.\n\nNeedless to say, there is a lot of frightening and bad news in this world. Now, let me give you some very good news.\n\nThree years ago, during our 2016 campaign, when we brought forth our progressive agenda we were told that our ideas were \"radical,\" and \"extreme.\" We were told that Medicare for All, a $15 an hour minimum wage, free tuition at public colleges and universities, aggressively combating climate change, demanding that the wealthy start paying their fair share of taxes, were all of concepts that the American people would never accept.\n\nWell, three years have come and gone. And, as result of millions of Americans standing up and fighting back, all of these policies and more are now supported by a majority of Americans.\n\nTogether, you and I and our 2016 campaign began the political revolution. Now, it is time to complete that revolution and implement the vision that we fought for.\n\nSo here is my question for you:\n\nWill you stand with me as part of a million person grassroots movement which can not only win the Democratic primary, not only win the general election but most importantly help transform this country so that, finally, we have a government that works for all of us and not just the few? Add your name to say you will.\n\nTogether we can create a nation that leads the world in the struggle for peace and for economic, racial, social and environmental justice.\n\nAnd together we can defeat Donald Trump and repair the damage he has done to our country.\n\nBrothers and sisters, if we stand together, there is no limit to what we can accomplish.\n\nI hope you will join me.\n\nThank you very much.\n\nIn solidarity,\n\nBernie Sanders"}, {"comment_id": "egsxyhe", "post_id": "asac31", "comment": "Even if he doesn't win, he'll force every democratic candidate farther to the left on major issues.

That puppet put Ajit Pai as chair of the FCC who, with Russia's help, destroyed Net Neutrality and started us on a path where corporations, which are easily manipulated by the Russian government, control what the American public sees and hears.  The Russian government also controls the largest donor to the party that currently controls both chambers of congress and uses that donor to launder Russian money to those politicians so that those politicians will act in accordance with what the Russian government wants even if it runs counter to the will and needs of the American people.  The Russian puppet in the white house, with the help of the Russian controlled congress, has also stacked the bench of the supreme court with, at best, judges who are blindly beholden to the party of Russia and, at worst, blindly beholden to Russia.  The puppet in the white house has also installed another Russian puppet in the position of attorney general.  The Russian backed party also controls the majority of state legislatures (31) and governorship (34).  At nearly every level of governance Russia controls, either directly or indirectly, the US government.  At what point do we, as a populace, stop respecting the authority of the United States government?  At what point do we no longer respect the authority of the \"President of the United States\"?  At what point do we either admit that the United States has become a puppet state of Russia or cry out that this is the most grievous and blatant act of war ever to go unresponded to in the history of the world?  If, in 1960, Russia had attempted to do anything like what we find out they do on a daily basis now, nukes would have flown.  At this point it seems to me the only reason to respect the authority of almost any part of the United States government is either out of fear of the police and military or because we are afraid of losing what few scraps of food have fallen trough the cracks from the people profiting off of all of this.

And the Trump campaign lied about being in contact with him about it.  The biggest new news here is that *someone* directed a senior campaign official to talk to Stone about Wikileaks. (I had previously said this was Bannon, and while Bannon was in discussions with Stone this specific line may be referring to a different senior official due to the dates)\n\nYou can use [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/us/politics/wikileaks-roger-stone-trump.html) from November to un-redact a lot of the communications listed in this indictment.  Some of these communications are involving Bannon and Breitbart based on this.\n\n\"Organization 1\" is Wikileaks.\n\n Corsi and Credico are listed as Person 1 and Person 2 respectively.\n\n> \" After the July 22, 2016 release of stolen DNC emails by Wikileaks, a senior Trump campaign official was directed to contact Stone about any additional releases\"  \n\nWho in the Trump campaign other than Trump could direct senior campaign officials to contact Stone? And who is the senior official(this appears to be BEFORE Bannon had an actual role in the campaign thanks for pointing that out) \n\n> \" On or about the same day, Corsi forwarded Stone's email to \"an associate who lived in the UK and was a support of the Trump Campaign\"\n\nThis appears to be [referring to Farage-Ally Ted Malloch](https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/justice-department/mueller-has-emails-stone-pal-corsi-about-wikileaks-dem-email-n940611)\n\n> \"Would not hurt to start suggesting HRC old, memory bad, has stroke- neither he nor she well.\"\n\nAgain further proof of the line of communication to the Trump campaign, as the campaign DID start pushing the idea that Hillary's health was in jeopardy during the election. \n\n> On or about October 4, 2016, Assange held a press conference but did not release any new materials pertaining to the Clinton Campaign. Shortly afterwards, Stone received an email from high-ranking Trump campaign official asking about the status of future releases by Wikileaks. Stone answered that Assange had a serious security concern but that Wikileaks would release a load every week going forward\" \n\nThis one appears to be referring to Steve Bannon based on [this.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/11/01/roger-stones-story-just-changed-russia-again/?utm_term=.be691c7e19e6&noredirect=on) The question is was Bannon the ONLY senior campaign official, if he's the same official from higher up who directed him? The obvious answer here is Trump. If he's not the senior official, who is?\n\nSo I didn't list them all here, but it makes EXPLICITLY clear that not only did Stone know of the hacks/leaks, he was in constant contact with the Trump campaign while doing so. And they've denied it every step of the way. \n\nWhat this indictment also makes clear is that the GOP in Congress AGAIN didn't follow up on obvious leads where Stone was lying to them, despite Dems wanting to do so. \n\nSo things I'm still trying to solve : \n\n- Who is \"an associate of the high-ranking Trump Campaign official[Bannon] \" \n- Who directed the Senior Campaign official?\n- Who other than Bannon, the mystery senior campaign official and the person who directed him is involved? Since the indictments make clear he was in contact with multiple senior officials within the Campaign.\n\nCouple bonus fun things : \n\n5 days after *someone* directs a senior Trump campaign official to contact Stone, Trump's famous \"Russia if you are listening\" line occurs. And as indicated in the GRU indictments, Russia responded by trying to hack into Clinton's emails. '\n\n\nThis is the 37th indictment from Mueller and the 6th Trump official to be indicted. \n\nAs always if you have any questions about Trump-Russia feel free to ask and I will try to help.

The speed will not correct itself until a modem reboot. I have all my own gear and never had any issue and monitor my own equipment, I can constantly monitor my ms and or ping while in game and can see somethings wrong, funny thing is a speed test will return me to normal for a while. From what I understand they have an algorithm for detecting the speed tests (They own and sponsor one of the major speed test sites like other ISPs do as well) and my speeds by the second or 3rd test will return to normal. I dont give a shit if its throttling, hop rerouting, or \"traffic  management system with a queue line\" its a form of control to milk us for all we are worth. They have received the government subsidies time and time again to improve infrastructure and create city networks to bolster speeds across the states and cities they are residing in, they have absorbed all of the money into profits and have put almost nothing into their work. Fuck the ISPs, they make something absurd like 90% profits already. We know they are full of shit about needing money to improve their companies ability to provides services because they are legally obligated to tell the invested parties the truth about the financial position of the company on a yearly basis and reports say otherwise. Also these jerk offs need to get checked by the court system and I hope the Intel puma 6 chipset fiasco will bite them in the ass. 1/2 of the high end modems you can rent from them in the arris series are plagued with faulty cpu's that cause frequent hiccups in your internet connection and require modem soft resets to re-establish connection. The ISPs put in for the cheapest possible chip to work with these extremely demanding gateway devices that have monitoring software built into them to help with literally tracking every single thing you ever do, including but not limited to monitoring you even when you are browsin in incognito mode. I am sorry for the rant, I am sick and tired of dealing with multi million corporations who will nickle and dime you to death when they cant even get their heads out of their asses to even make their services they are rendering to you are done so correctly and professionally. Almost everything to do with these companies is negative and even major cities want to kick them out.

Putin.** At one point last summer, Mr. Trump said at a campaign event that he hoped Russian intelligence services had stolen Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails and would make them public.\n\n>**The officials said the intercepted communications were not limited to Trump campaign officials, and included other associates of Mr. Trump.** On the Russian side, the contacts also included members of the Russian government outside of the intelligence services, the officials said. All of the current and former officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because the continuing investigation is classified.\n\n>**The officials said that one of the advisers picked up on the calls was Paul Manafort**, who was Mr. Trump\u2019s campaign chairman for several months last year and had worked as a political consultant in Russia and Ukraine. The officials declined to identify the other Trump associates on the calls.\n\n>**The call logs and intercepted communications are part of a larger trove of information that the F.B.I. is sifting through as it investigates the links between Mr. Trump\u2019s associates and the Russian government, as well as the D.N.C. hack**, according to federal law enforcement officials. **As part of its inquiry, the F.B.I. has obtained banking and travel records and conducted interviews**, the officials said.\n\n>...\n\n>The intercepted calls are different from the wiretapped conversations last year between Michael T. Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser, and Sergey I. Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the United States. During those calls, which led to Mr. Flynn\u2019s resignation on Monday night, the two men discussed sanctions that the Obama administration imposed on Russia in December.\n\n>...\n\n>**The F.B.I. has closely examined at least four other people close to Mr. Trump**, although it is unclear if their calls were intercepted. They are **Carter Page**, a businessman and former foreign policy adviser to the campaign; **Roger Stone**, a longtime Republican operative; and **Mr. Flynn.**\n\n\n-----------\n\n#####David Corn\u2019s piece from earlier today:\n\n[The Question the White House Won't Answer: Did Trump's Campaign Have Contact With Russia?]( http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/02/sean-spicer-ducks-question-about-trump-campaign-contacts-with-russia)\n\n>Yet the **Washington Post reported days ago that Kislyak told the newspaper he had been in touch with Flynn since before the election.** The ambassador declined to say what he and Flynn had discussed. And the newspaper reported that the Flynn-Kislyak conversations \"were **part of a series of contacts between Flynn and Kislyak that began before the Nov. 8 election and continued during the transition**, officials said.\" These facts and Kislyak's comment **undercut Trump's and Pence's assertions there were no pre-election contacts.** \n\n>So what was Spicer to say when Karl posed this query? At first, Spicer said that Flynn did speak to the Russian ambassador during the transition. ***No, Karl protested, that's not the question.*** **What about** ***before*** **the election?** Spicer then sputtered out this reply: \n\n>\"***There's nothing that would conclude me that anything different has changed with respect to that time period.\"***\n\n>That **contorted reply** would seem to mean that the White House is sticking to its previous denial. But this assertion **runs contrary to what is now the public record**: that the Trump campaign was in contact with Putin's man in Washington while Putin was subverting an American election to help Trump. **What was going on? What was said? What messages did Flynn send to the Putin regime?** These are the obvious questions that warrant answers. **They are also dangerous questions for Trump.** And that's why Spicer cannot acknowledge the hard truth that the Flynn scandal started before the election. **These contacts deserve as much, if not more, attention than the conversations that triggered this controversy**, for they are relevant to the fundamental subject at hand: **Trump's relationship with the autocratic leader who mounted an operation to subvert American democracy to assist Trump.**\n\n\n---------\n\n#####[Other Spicer comments from today](http://www.usnews.com/news/world/articles/2017-02-14/trump-expects-russia-to-return-crimea-to-ukraine-white-house):\n\n>\"**President Trump has made it very clear that he expects the Russian government to de-escalate violence in the Ukraine and return Crimea**,\" Spicer said at a daily news briefing. \"At the same time, he fully expects to and wants to get along with Russia.\"\n\nReports from last year contradicting this newfound toughness on Russia:\n\n[How The Trump Campaign Weakened The Republican Platform On Aid To Ukraine](http://www.npr.org/2016/08/06/488876597/how-the-trump-campaign-weakened-the-republican-platform-on-aid-to-ukraine)\n\n[Trump campaign guts GOP\u2019s anti-Russia stance on Ukraine](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html?utm_term=.e9ffd4bf615c)\n\n[Trump Campaign Changed Ukraine Platform, Lied About It](http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2016/08/03/trump-campaign-changed-ukraine-platform-lied-about-it.html)\n\n[Did Trump campaign soften platform language to benefit Russia?]\n(http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2016/aug/04/did-trump-campaign-soften-platform-language-benefi/)\n\n--------\n\n#####Roger Stone *admitted* to having contact with Wikileaks:\n\nOn October 12, 2016, [Stone told a CBS affiliate in Miami](http://miami.cbslocal.com/2016/10/12/trump-ally-roger-stone-admits-back-channel-tie-to-wikileaks/amp/?utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=amp&utm_source=www.miamiherald.com-RelayMediaAMP):\n\n>\"I do have a back-channel communication with Assange, because we have a good mutual friend\u201d \n\n-----\n\n#####Also from this current NYT piece re: the Steele Dossier:\n\n>**As part of the inquiry, the F.B.I. is also trying to assess the credibility of information contained in a dossier that was given to the bureau last year by a former British intelligence operative.** The dossier contained a raft of salacious allegations about connections between Mr. Trump, his associates and the Russian government. It also included unsubstantiated claims that the Russians had embarrassing videos that could be used to blackmail Mr. Trump.\n\n>The F.B.I. has spent several months investigating the leads in the dossier, but has yet to confirm any of its most explosive allegations.\n\n>**Senior F.B.I. officials believe that the former British intelligence officer who compiled the dossier, Christopher Steele, has a credible track record, and he briefed F.B.I. investigators last year about how he obtained the information.

Thompson had to say about Richard Nixon.\n\n> It is Nixon himself who represents that dark, venal and incurably violent side of the American character that almost every country in the world has learned to fear and despise. Our Barbie-doll president, with his Barbie-doll wife and his boxful of Barbie-doll children is also America's answer to the monstrous Mr. Hyde. He speaks for the Werewolf in us; the bully, the predatory shyster who turns into something unspeakable, full of claws and bleeding string-warts on nights when the moon comes too close\u2026\n\n-\n\n> If the current polls are reliable... Nixon will be re-elected by a huge majority of Americans who feel he is not only more honest and more trustworthy than George McGovern, but also more likely to end the war in Vietnam. The polls also indicate that Nixon will get a comfortable majority of the Youth Vote. And that he might carry all fifty states... This may be the year when we finally come face to face with ourselves; finally just lay back and say it \u2014 that we are really just a nation of 220 million used car salesmen with all the money we need to buy guns, and no qualms at all about killing anybody else in the world who tries to make us uncomfortable. The tragedy of all this is that George McGovern, for all his mistakes... understands what a fantastic monument to all the best instincts of the human race this country might have been, if we could have kept it out of the hands of greedy little hustlers like Richard Nixon. McGovern made some stupid mistakes, but in context they seem almost frivolous compared to the things Richard Nixon does every day of his life, on purpose... Jesus! Where will it end? How low do you have to stoop in this country to be President?\n\n-\n\n> We've come to a point where every four years this national fever rises up \u2014 this hunger for the Saviour, the White Knight, the Man on Horseback \u2014 and whoever wins becomes so immensely powerful, like Nixon is now, that when you vote for President today you're talking about giving a man dictatorial power for four years. I think it might be better to have the President sort of like the King of England \u2014 or the Queen \u2014 and have the real business of the presidency conducted by... a City Manager-type, a Prime Minister, somebody who's directly answerable to Congress, rather than a person who moves all his friends into the White House and does whatever he wants for four years. The whole framework of the presidency is getting out of hand. It's come to the point where you almost can't run unless you can cause people to salivate and whip each other with big sticks. You almost have to be a rock star to get the kind of fever you need to survive in American politics.\n\nImagine if he'd lived to see Trump. He saw it coming though. Maybe that's why he checked out.

Just a heads up: there is no tiebreaking vote for a tied House of Delegates. The Lt. Gov casts a tiebreaking vote in the state senate which is currently 21-19.\n\nThere is no written process for how to tiebreak in the VA House of Delegates. The last time a 50-50 split occurred was in 1998 and that was dealt with through a bipartisan power sharing agreement. Therefore, we have no idea who the next speaker will be. No clue which party either.\n\nIf y'all have any questions feel free to ask.\n\nEDIT: Hey so this has gotten a lot of attention. I love my state government, so I'll definitely keep answering all the questions y'all have. However, I just got PMed a Star Wars spoiler approximately 4 and a half hours before I was going to see it, so any further answers shall wait until after that.\n\nEDIT 2: While y'all are here, I recommend you look into the current governor of VA: Terry McAuliffe. Quite frankly, after living in this state all my life, he's who I want to run for president in 2020. He's led the state through great economic success. He's ardently protected civil rights, vetoing the most legislation of any VA governor and prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation on his first day as governor. The Virginia constitution takes away the right to vote from felons. Governor McAuliffe attempted to restore many nonviolent ex-felon's rights through an executive order, but was told no by the VA supreme court.

Provide financial support to pilot local and state level no-call lists.\n* Ban the use of facial recognition software for policing.\n\nProvide More Support to Police Officers and Create A Robust Non-Law Enforcement Alternative Response System:\n\n* Establish national standards for use of force by police that emphasize de-escalation.\n* Require and fund police officer training on implicit bias (to include biases based on race, gender, sexual orientation and identity, religion, ethnicity and class), cultural competency, de-escalation, crisis intervention, adolescent development, and how to interact with people with mental and physical disabilities. We will ensure that training is conducted in a meaningful way with strict independent oversight and enforceable guidelines.\n* Ban the practice of any law enforcement agency benefiting from civil asset forfeiture.  Limit or eliminate federal criminal justice funding for any state or locality that does not comply.\n* Provide funding to states and municipalities to create civilian corps of unarmed first responders, such as social workers, EMTs, and trained mental health professionals, who can handle order maintenance violations, mental health emergencies, and low-level conflicts outside the criminal justice system, freeing police officers to concentrate on the most serious crimes.\n* Incentivize access to counseling and mental health services for officers.\n* Diversify police forces and academies and incentivize officers to live and work in the communities they serve.\n\n**Ensuring All Americans Due Process**\n\nRight to Counsel:\n\n* Triple congressional spending on indigent defense, to $14 billion annually.\n* After a review of current salaries and workload, set a minimum starting salary for all public defenders.\n* Create and set a national formula to assure populations have a minimum number of public defenders to assure full access to constitutional right to due process.\n* Establish federal guidelines and goals for a right to counsel, including policies that reduce the number of cases overall. \n* Create a federal agency to provide support and oversight for state public defense services. \n* Authorize the Department of Justice to take legal action against jurisdictions that are not meeting their Sixth Amendment obligations. \n* Cancel all existing student debt and cancel any future student debt for public defenders through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.\n\nEnsure Accountability and Fairness in Prosecution:\n\n* Rescind former Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 orders on prosecutorial discretion and low-level offenses. \n* Appoint an Attorney General committed to public safety and creating a more just and humane criminal justice system.\n* Limit \u201cabsolute immunity\u201d for prosecutors, which is used to shield wrongdoers from liability.\n* End the practice of jailing material witnesses.\n* Place a moratorium on the use of the algorithmic risk assessment tools in the criminal justice system until an audit is completed.

People serving long sentences will undergo a \u201csecond look\u201d process to make sure their sentence is still appropriate.\n* End \u201cthree strikes\u201d laws. No one should spend their life behind bars for committing minor crimes, even if they commit several of them.\n* Invigorate and expand the compassionate release process so that people with disabilities, the sick and elderly are transitioned out of incarceration whenever possible.\n* Expand the use of sentencing alternatives, including community supervision and publicly funded halfway houses.

This includes doubling McKinney-Vento homelessness assistance grants to build permanent supportive housing, and $500 million to provide outreach to homeless people to help connect them to available services.

ICE held Galicia even though he had documents on him that proved he was born in Texas. But by Tuesday afternoon, a little over 24 hours after the Morning News's story came out, Galicia went free.\n\nAs the Morning News reports, Galicia's detention \"appears to have been a bureaucratic mix up,\" caused by an application for a Mexican visa to visit the U.S. filled out in his name. Galicia told the paper that he was held with 60 other men and not allowed to shower for the 23 days he was held, and by the time he was released he had lost 26 pounds. \"It was inhumane how they treated us,\" he said. \"It got to the point where I was ready to sign a deportation paper just to not be suffering there anymore. I just needed to get out of there.\"\n\nThe broad strokes of Galicia's story, a U.S. citizen held by immigration authorities and threatened with deportation because of paperwork, is shockingly common. Peter Sean Brown, a Philadelphia man with the same name as an immigrant, was held for weeks and nearly deported to Jamaica. Officials weren't swayed by his state-issued IDs that are only available to people with social security numbers. And in March of this year, 9-year-old Julia Medina was detained by CBP for 32 hours despite her being a U.S. citizen.\n\n\nThough she's an American, Medina's family lives in Tijuana, and they cross the border each morning to get to school.

Medina was finally released after her mother pleaded with the Mexican consulate to contact U.S. immigration authorities.\n\nIn all of these cases, Galicia, Brown, and Medina had paperwork on them that proved they were U.S. citizens when they were apprehended. But clearly that wasn't enough to prevent detention by an administration that views non-white people as suspicious.

I would love if someone could truthfully answer this question. \n\n\n-\tA 1040 will not show net worth. You will have no idea if Trump is worth 1k or 100 billion. \n-\tA 1040 will not show debt to foreign countries. \n-\tA 1040 will not show if he has many business relationships in foreign countries. \n-\tA 1040 will not show all income from foreign countries (even if he did have a lot, it would be buried in his companies, not on a personal level that would be displayed on his 1040). For example interest is all grouped together as \u201cforeign countries\u201d. Don\u2019t believe me? Look at Obama\u2019s or Bush\u2019s tax return. You have 0 idea where that income was generated or how. \n-\tA 1040 does not show foreign bank accounts. That\u2019s a completely different form. \n\nSo why would he not show his 1040 then? Easy. He doesn\u2019t pay taxes. Most of his income is from real estate and when the market died in 2008, I assume he had massive losses and he is still using those losses to offset any income he is generating and therefore pays no taxes. His base isn\u2019t smart enough to understand NOLs and would be upset if they found out they pay more taxes than he does. \n\nEdit: Why am I getting downvoted for presenting facts?\n\nEdit: Edited it to change the tax return date to 2005. I just took a look at it and he has 103 million in NOLs on that return. Considering after that his income was 48 million, that\u2019s a massive \u201cdiscount\u201d on the taxes he owed that year. I have no doubt he has NOLs now that are probably 10x that in 2005. And considering this was a calculated \u201cleak\u201d one can assume this is probably the year where he paid the most taxes in a very long time.

Thats how things like the holocaust happen. All the soldiers employed by Germany took their orders and followed them. It's actually said by many sources that it's surprising the Germans didn't even try to revolt against the cruel things they were told to do. Time amd time again history repeats. The crowd (cows) like to not have to put effort into researching fact from fiction because its so much easier to just follow someone who says things. And when someone else says something contradictory, it's easy to dismiss it as false because it doesnt follow ones beliefs. Theres no logic in it. Global warming is a great one, we have all these people who dont want it to be real because it is an uncomfortable nasty thought. They'll gladly ignore it and or dig up some false fact to try to prove their point that it isnt real. Republicans love saying things not based on fact. If they just make something up or use terms everyone knows but use it in a twisted way then people will believe it without question. The other thing they love to do is completely attack their opponents in every degrading way they can including making up facts and twisting truths. This leads into Russian involvement in trying to manipulate the last presidential election by spreading as much false and made up facts about Hilliary as possible and it worked so well that people still look back and think Hillary has trafficking gangs and everything else. I agree she wasnt a great candidate. But trump just straight up lies and if you dont do what he wants he'll do everything he can to make you quit so he can replace you with someone who will follow his lies. Just like a typical CEO. Think of how many people have been killed by the behavior of people with these attitudes. There have been numerous accidents in history because people in charge didnt want to listen to what the engineers said. As such, people got killed. \n\nTrump supporters also love talking about how well the economy is doing and how much better it got under trump. Anyone that has looked at economy charts/trends could see that nothing magnificent happened under trump. I dont know about you but the stock market has been doing things not seen since the 2008 recession and some things arent equaled since the great depression (not in a good way). I've Also been reading from every credible source for the last 4 months that we are now expected to be in a recession around next December. Another thing my friends love to tout is all the pay raises/bonuses companies have gave/given employees since trump. I dont know about you but I never got a raise/bonus. I dont know anyone whose gotten a raise/bonus because of this. My wages continue to not even increase with inflation each year and I'm an engineer.

With this Mueller witch-hunt, how much money has been spent? \n\nHannity\n\n>In the seven million range. We'll get nothing out of it. Absolutely nothing. \n\n1:44 Back to our phones we go, here's Leo:\n\n(Asks question about Hillary Clinton and says Mueller is incompetent). \n\nSo far no comment on all this. I'll update if something comes up. \n\nHere we go:\n1:46\n\n> I've known Michael a very long time. He never represented me as a lawyer, I never paid legal fees to Michael, I have occasionally consulted him, and I assume those conversations were attorney-client confidential. (Wut?) \n\n> I have eight attorneys that I have for various things in my life, and Michael would occasionally give me his time and I'd ask him a legal question. I don't know why the media is making a big deal about it.\n\n1:49\n\n> We definitely would say \"attorney-client\" when I asked him anything, but I never used him for any third-party work, ever. I was never involved with him and any third party. \n\n1:50\n\n> Maybe I handed him ten bucks for attorney client privilege, whatever. But I never had any matter with him between him and any third party. \n\n1:51\n\n> It's pretty unbelievable, the world we live in. (lol.)\n\n1:52\n\n> Here's a question (to the cohost) I have all sorts of attorneys, how many do I have.\n\n> Cohost: So many attorneys.\n\n> Hannity: Okay let's take a break.\n\nNot really much of substance there, he basically says that although he's known Michael Cohen for a long time and has often used him for legal questions, and never paid any legal fees, except maybe \"ten bucks now and then for attorney-client privilege\", he never used Cohen for anything with a third party. \n\n________\n\n1:58 \n\n> I'll put this statement out: Look, Michael Cohen never represented me in any specific matter. I never retained him. I never paid legal fees. I asked him questions for his legal input. And I assume those conversations were under attorney-client privilege.\n\nNow another commercial break. \n\n2:09, discussion is about getting Sessions onto the NY investigation because he hasn't recused himself from that, just from the Russia investigation. \n\nLooks like that's all Hannity is saying about this.

However, in 2016, the Republican presidential candidate decided to buck those norms and did not release his tax returns for the previous year or any year. The only solution in such cases is to convert the norm in to a law, so that in the future candidates -- not just Trump, but all candidates -- must release tax returns.\n\nThis is actually a response that even conservative judges would stand behind (Well, the non-hypocritical ones, anyway). A common criticism of liberal positions from a conservative jurist's perspective is that while the liberal position might be *fair, just, or reasonable,* if the law contradicts the liberal position then the judges must rule against them. Judges must follow the law, not some squishy definition of fairness/justice. The argument says that if liberals want to avoid this problem *next* time, they should go and change the law through the formal legal process, and then the fair, just position becomes law. \n\nSo I'm arguing that not only does this stick it to Trump, but that this is the best way to fix loopholes/gaps in the system.

And soon after that, the Saudis announced they would invest $20 billion in an infrastructure fund managed by Blackstone Group LP.

Many times extremely poor pay. Causing many current employees to work extra shifts or pick up side work. Costing taxpayers millions in overtime and a high turnout rate as many officers I know make more from their side jobs than serving citizens. Theses massive labor shortages attribute to the reoccurring issues with poor police and citizen relations as the \"bad apples\" get in because sometimes the department has no choice because they need a body on the streets. An causes issues where counties like mine hold hiring events in places as far away as NY costing taxpayers money that should be kept at home.\n\nFire also suffers from a labor shortage in many areas causing delayed response times. (Compounded by next issue) An not enough training leads to times where fire is first on scene and could save a life or assist in a situation but doesn't have the training. These problems also lead to millions in overtime and high turnout rates among fire.\n\nThe black cat of the family Emergency Medical Services (EMTs, EMT -Is, AEMTs, Paramedics) is a crap show in this state. They a poorly paid, money/profit is being made by major private companies at the expense of lives and employees. We don't have a shortage of trained personnel, we have a shortage of trained personnel  who are willing to work for little money (sub $15 an hour for even the highest level care providers) and many times working 12 to 24 hours shifts, without a break. Which is not only extremely dangerous for the crews but the citizens they try to serve as well. Also many of these companies provide no benefits and threaten sick employees to work for be fired. This needs to change, EMS needs to be classified as a necessity and given the same benefits as fire and police. Because not only do they require more training but have there lives on the line to. Also as redundancy, this causes enormous turnout rates and costs.\n\nUnknown to most the national guard still faces job discrimination in this state and people can be fired for serving with no course of action because this is a right to work state. USERRA only protects if the soldier can prove wrong doing. But with right to work, the company doesn't have to give any reason or documentation to the firing/punishment/loss of advancement. So your state employees that are sworn to defend it and the country still have a hard time holding down jobs.

In criminal law, conspiracy is a charge that sort of \"attaches\" to another crime. This is usually called the \"substantive\" offense. In order to prove conspiracy liability, it has to be demonstrated that (1) two or more people made an agreement to commit a crime, and (2) one of the persons involved in the agreement committed an act to achieve or attempt to achieve commission of the substantive offense.\n\nThe second element is clearly fulfilled, as Michael Cohen just plead guilty to violating federal election law on behalf of the Trump campaign. The question, then, is whether Trump and Cohen agreed to commit this crime together. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that they did. Cohen's tapes prove that Trump was aware of the payment to Stormy, even suggesting that they pay cash. Giuliani has publicly stated that Trump reimbursed Cohen the payment. Furthermore, Trump's constant lies surrounding the matter undermine his credibility. \n\nNot only did Trump commit a crime, he committed a crime in order to increase his chances of winning the 2016 election.

Remember that through most of his stint as President, he has had a Republican dominated Congress who actively opposed everything he tried to push for, or anything that any Democrat pushed for.

I referred to this as a 'rape,' but I do not want my words to be interpreted in a literal or criminal sense.\"\n\nA former Trump business associate, Jill Harth, claimed in a 1997 lawsuit the New York real estate mogul \u201cattempted rape\u201d and groped her without her consent on various occasions. In the suit, Harth described a violent encounter at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, in which Trump allegedly threw her against the wall of one of his children\u2019s bedrooms before lifting up her dress.\n\nIt was a shocking thing to have him do this, because he knew I was with George [her partner], he knew they were in the next room,\" she recalled in an October 2016 interview with The Guardian. \"How could he be doing this when I'm there for business?\"\n\nIn the pre-election interview, Harth maintained her allegations against Trump despite having withdrawn her lawsuit against him after he settled a separate suit her partner filed over a business dispute.\n\nMichael Cohen, his former lawyer and top aide, defended him against Ivana Trump\u2019s claims, saying, \"**By the very definition, you can't rape your spouse.**\"\n\nThe president has also been accused of sexual harassment or assault by at least 16 women.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dpymkho", "post_id": "7dl6b9", "comment": ">\u201cI don't necessarily agree with his victims, his victims are terrible,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe is really a victim himself.

My father, he flew a lot, as a kid I remember flying a lot too, and other people they have told me that they too have flown many times over the years. And these airports, these guys, they're just pointing at empty plane roads. I can point, look right now, I'm pointing at you miss who must be cold because you are pointing back at me. And these guys they would not let my diamond crested, and I know I'm a bit late showing up here. But, these guys they were pointing at the plan road and they pointed my diamond crested solid baby teeth jet to the wrong airplane garage. And for 20 , 30 years now, my jet has had no trouble being pointed to the right garage.

This golden M restaraunt changed it's name to fit my own name as they saw how much I enjoyed their food. This \"Mac Donalds\" and they saw me smiling, I have a beautiful smile, just look at me smiling at your perky breasts, those are lovely. And the french fries were lovely too, these little shoelace, with just the right amount of salt. I don't like too much salt, I am not salty. And they saw me smiling so much, and I said, you know, this meal, this meal here. This golden burger and fries and this pop, if I could have a transformer with this, this would make me happy. This would be Donalds Happy Meal. And you know, I bet because I am so influential and they enjoyed experiencing me and my presence there so much. I bet you that they use that idea and make it their own. But, know this, you, yes you who needs a better waxer, it was I that made the McDonald's Happy Meal, and if my jet had not been late and made me hungry, you would not be able to thank me for this wonderful idea that I thought of all on my own.

Trump was already in deep financial distress, losing tens of millions of dollars on troubled business deals, according to previously unrevealed figures from his federal income tax returns.\n\n>Mr. Trump was propelled to the presidency, in part, by a self-spun narrative of business success and of setbacks triumphantly overcome. He has attributed his first run of reversals and bankruptcies to the recession that took hold in 1990. But 10 years of tax information obtained by The New York Times paints a different, and far bleaker, picture of his deal-making abilities and financial condition.\n\n>The data \u2014 printouts from Mr. Trump\u2019s official Internal Revenue Service tax transcripts, with the figures from his federal tax form, the 1040, for the years 1985 to 1994 \u2014 represents the fullest and most detailed look to date at the president\u2019s taxes, information he has kept from public view. Though the information does not cover the tax years at the center of an escalating battle between the Trump administration and Congress, it traces the most tumultuous chapter in a long business career \u2014 an era of fevered acquisition and spectacular collapse.\n\n>The numbers show that in 1985, Mr. Trump reported losses of $46.1 million from his core businesses \u2014 largely casinos, hotels and retail space in apartment buildings. They continued to lose money every year, totaling $1.17 billion in losses for the decade.\n\n>In fact, year after year, Mr. Trump appears to have lost more money than nearly any other individual American taxpayer, The Times found when it compared his results with detailed information the I.R.S. compiles on an annual sampling of high-income earners. His core business losses in 1990 and 1991 \u2014 more than $250 million each year \u2014 were more than double those of the nearest taxpayers in the I.R.S. information for those years.\n\nIf this trend never changed, except for money coming in from Russia Eric bragged about, that is probably why he didn't want to release.

If Mueller wanted to charge someone and the attorney general forbade it, it would seem that action would have to be revealed to Congress. Nothing in the rules requires the revelations to Congress to be confidential. Nor do they say whether that report is short or long. So Barr must make a report and, once again, can decide how detailed to be.  \n>  \n>If they are not satisfied that the full story has been released, congressional Democrats may try to subpoena the report and have Mueller testify in committee.\n\n \n\n \n\n&#x200B;"}, {"comment_id": "ej5dg82", "post_id": "b4agza", "comment": "Great, now release the whole thing.

In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money and it [continued for decades](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html). In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.\n\n\u25ba In 1984, David Bogatin \u2014 a Russian mobster, convicted gasoline bootlegger, and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss \u2014 met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, [Apr 30, 1992](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html))\n\n\u25ba Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former \"fixer\" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.\n\n\u25ba Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.\n\n\u25ba Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years, that many of them have owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties, that they were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel. (Mogilevich's role today is unclear).\n\n\u25ba One of the most important things that is often overlooked is that the Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.\n\n\u25ba From Craig Unger's AMA: \"Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.\"\n\n\u25ba  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate). \n\n\u25ba According to a Bloomberg investigation (March 16, 2017) into Trump World Tower,  \u201ca third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.\u201d\n\n\u25ba In July 2008, the height of the recession, Donald Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value. \n\n\u25ba In 2013, Federal agents busted an \u201cultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring\u201d run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. In addition to card games, they operated illegal gambling websites, ran a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a \u201csophisticated money-laundering scheme\u201d connected to Semion Mogilevich. \n\n\u25ba  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive under his tenure in the Southern District and Mayor. And now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.\n\n\u25ba A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money. \n\n\u25ba At the Cityscape USA\u2019s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying \"...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\" \n\n\u25ba Eric Trump told James Dodson, a golf reporter, in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because \u201cWe don\u2019t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.\u201d\n\nOutcomes that show Trump is taking orders from Putin:\n\n\u25ba At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a [strong push](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/04/defying-history-moscow-moves-defend-soviet-war-afghanistan/?utm_term=.d077fc6cf274) for a resolution that would justify their country\u2019s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists\u2019 goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on [January 2nd](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-cracked-afghan-history-11546560234), Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n\u25ba Trump went against American intelligence on North Korean missiles. He told the FBI he didn't believe their intelligence because Putin told him otherwise. [\"I don't care, I believe Putin\"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/18/i-believe-putin-trump-dismissed-us-advice-on-north-korea-threat-says-mccabe) \n\n\u25ba  Trump met in secret with Putin the G20 summit in November 2018, without note takers. 19 days later, he announced a withdrawal from Syria. As a note, Trump conducted FIVE completely private meetings and conferences with Putin, and has gone to great lengths to prevent literally anyone, even people in his administration, from learning what was discussed.\n\n\u25ba  Trump refused to enforce sanctions legally codified into law - and in some cases reversed standing sanctions on Russian companies.\n\n\u25ba  He has denounced his own intelligence agencies in a press conference with Putin on election meddling - and publicly endorsed Putin's version of events. .\n\n\u25ba  Trump pulled out of the INF treaty with no explanation, which allows Putin to create long-range hypersonic missiles that threaten Europe with impunity. The US already has all the weaponry that the INF would ban the development of, so this offers us literally nothing, while allowing Russia to develop powerful new weapons to challenge our allies. \n\n\u25ba  And of course, Trump continues to threaten to pull out of NATO, a move so catastrophically stupid, so inconceivably cosmically myopic, I truly can't express the profundity of the idiocy. Suffice to say, pulling out of NATO would be like the only guy in a prison yard with a shotgun just throwing it over the fence for absolutely no reason, suddenly giving the people with crude homemade shivs complete power. \n\n\u25ba In summation: Trump was $4 billion in debt and the Russians [bailed him out](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/). They own him, and he loves them.\n\nI've reached my 10k limit and URLs are the first thing to go. "}, {"comment_id": "ej5he7k", "post_id": "b4agza", "comment": "Wow, that was fast.

So there are three key \"c\"-words here\u2014\"criminal,\" \"counterintelligence,\" and \"Congressional.\"\n\n3/ Special Counsel Mueller is part of the \"criminal\" investigation; Mueller's work \\*intersects\\* with the \"counterintelligence\" investigation; and his work feeds into and draws from the Congressional investigation. And here's the key: all three of these investigations are ongoing.\n\n4/ As part of the \"criminal\" investigation, Mueller investigated some things his office then prosecuted; he investigated some things his office handed off to others; he investigated some things he chose not to prosecute; he investigated some things he is letting Congress handle.\n\n5/ Mueller's \"criminal\" investigations\u2014that is, the information he derived during his nearly 24 months of \\*criminal investigative work\\*\u2014then fed directly into multiple \"counterintelligence\" investigations and will undoubtedly feed into many ongoing \"Congressional\" investigations.\n\n6/ The news we got today is that Mueller will not \\*himself\\* be bringing any more indictments. That's it. That's \\*all\\* that has just happened. Any reporting that says the \"Russia probe is done\" is false. Any reporting that \"Mueller's work is done\" is false. It is only what I said.\n\n7/ Focusing \\*exclusively\\* on what Mueller's office will be doing going forward and \\*exclusively\\* on the criminal investigation\u2014so, a small part of what we somewhat misleadingly call the \"Trump-Russia scandal\"\u2014we can see that Mueller may be done indicting (\\*maybe\\*) but that's it.\n\n8/ As of today, Mueller had ten attorneys working for him (himself not included, I believe) down from seventeen originally. But we found out this week that certain attorneys who \"left\" his Office will \\*still be doing work for it\\*. Why? Because the Office has some work left to do.\n\n9/ That Office, whether still formally constituted or not, will see its attorneys prosecute Roger Stone in November, eight months from now. It will see its cooperating witness Rick Gates participate in \"multiple\" ongoing federal criminal investigations. And that's just the start:\n\n10/ The Office will see its cooperating witness Mike Flynn testify in the Kian trial in July (Kian was a NatSec official on Trump's transition team whose case intersects with all the other parts of the Trump-Russia investigation). Flynn is also involved in \\*multiple\\* other cases.\n\n11/ The Office will continue to pursue grand jury testimony from a Roger Stone witness, and continue to pursue a substantial trove of documents (for its grand jury, which is seated through July as far as was last reported) from an as-yet unnamed state-owned foreign corporation.\n\n12/ The Office has\u2014it appears\u2014referred to DOJ for prosecution at least one man it previously promised to prosecute (Corsi) and presumably has referred to DOJ for \\*possible\\* prosecution a whole host of \"Trumpworld\" figures who Congress has recently accused of perjuring themselves.\n\n13/ We also heard from major media over the past few weeks that Bob Mueller's office was referring out an unknown number of new cases to other federal prosecutors, including presumably\u2014based on past cooperation and information-sharing practices\u2014prosecutors in SDNY, EDVA, and DC.\n\n14/ We \\*also\\* know from major media that there are many ongoing cases for which Mueller's office conducted some of the investigation, all of the investigation, or shared information with the case's primary investigators, such as Cohen's SDNY cases and the Maria Butina case in DC.\n\n15/ What some in the media decided\u2014I do not know why\u2014is that the only cases they would associate with Mueller would be (a) indictments Mueller's office brought, (b) that were completed before he issued any report to the DOJ, and (c) immediately (on their face) involved collusion.\n\n16/ So you have reporters today blithely saying that \"Mueller is done\" when Mueller will be prosecuting Roger Stone for most of 2019. You have reporters saying \"he's done\" when cases he initiated are not only ongoing in multiple jurisdictions but may well provide new intel there.\n\n17/ If Roger Stone decides to cooperate\u2014before or after conviction\u2014that's Mueller. The same is true for Kian. The same is even true for Manafort (who can cooperate to reduce his sentence for the next year). But the same is also true for the many cases Gates and Flynn are working.\n\n18/ The same is true for Butina. And for indictments that arise from the ongoing counterintelligence investigation(s). Or any new criminal referrals that go from Congress to DOJ. The same is true for cases Mueller began\u2014that then went elsewhere\u2014that could lead to new indictments.\n\n19/ The same is true for any cases that Mueller passed directly on to DOJ to let DOJ decide whether to prosecute them or not. In short, media can tell us today that \\*Mueller himself\\* will bring no new indictments\u2014but even that might be conditioned by what happens in Stone's case."}, {"comment_id": "ej5edd7", "post_id": "b4agza", "comment": "Personally I\u2019m taking the Comey route, I just want the truth, no matter what it is.\n\nIf that means Trump had no serious wrongdoing then so be it. \n\nIf he did, then his ass needs to go.

In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money and it [continued for decades](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html). In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.\n\n\u25ba In 1984, David Bogatin \u2014 a Russian mobster, convicted gasoline bootlegger, and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss \u2014 met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, [Apr 30, 1992](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html))\n\n\u25ba Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former \"fixer\" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.\n\n\u25ba Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.\n\n\u25ba Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years, that many of them have owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties, that they were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel. (Mogilevich's role today is unclear).\n\n\u25ba One of the most important things that is often overlooked is that the Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.\n\n\u25ba From Craig Unger's AMA: \"Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.\"\n\n\u25ba  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate). \n\n\u25ba According to a Bloomberg investigation (March 16, 2017) into Trump World Tower,  \u201ca third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.\u201d\n\n\u25ba In July 2008, the height of the recession, Donald Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value. \n\n\u25ba In 2013, Federal agents busted an \u201cultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring\u201d run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. In addition to card games, they operated illegal gambling websites, ran a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a \u201csophisticated money-laundering scheme\u201d connected to Semion Mogilevich. \n\n\u25ba  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive under his tenure in the Southern District and Mayor. And now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.\n\n\u25ba A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M from Russia, then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money. \n\n\u25ba At the Cityscape USA\u2019s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying \"...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\" \n\n\u25ba Eric Trump told James Dodson, a golf reporter, in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because \u201cWe don\u2019t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.\u201d\n\nOutcomes that show Trump is taking orders from Putin:\n\n\u25ba At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a [strong push](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/04/defying-history-moscow-moves-defend-soviet-war-afghanistan/?utm_term=.d077fc6cf274) for a resolution that would justify their country\u2019s 1979 invasion of Afghanistan and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists\u2019 goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on [January 2nd](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-cracked-afghan-history-11546560234), Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n\u25ba Trump went against American intelligence on North Korean missiles. He told the FBI he didn't believe their intelligence because Putin told him otherwise. [\"I don't care, I believe Putin\"](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/feb/18/i-believe-putin-trump-dismissed-us-advice-on-north-korea-threat-says-mccabe) \n\n\u25ba  Trump met in secret with Putin the G20 summit in November 2018, without note takers. 19 days later, he announced a withdrawal from Syria. As a note, Trump conducted FIVE completely private meetings and conferences with Putin, and has gone to great lengths to prevent literally anyone, even people in his administration, from learning what was discussed.\n\n\u25ba  Trump refused to enforce sanctions legally codified into law - and in some cases reversed standing sanctions on Russian companies.\n\n\u25ba  He has denounced his own intelligence agencies in a press conference with Putin on election meddling - and publicly endorsed Putin's version of events. .\n\n\u25ba  Trump pulled out of the INF treaty with no explanation, which allows Putin to create long-range hypersonic missiles that threaten Europe with impunity. The US already has all the weaponry that the INF would ban the development of, so this offers us literally nothing, while allowing Russia to develop powerful new weapons to challenge our allies. \n\n\u25ba  And of course, Trump continues to threaten to pull out of NATO, a move so catastrophically stupid, so inconceivably cosmically myopic, I truly can't express the profundity of the idiocy. Suffice to say, pulling out of NATO would be like the only guy in a prison yard with a shotgun just throwing it over the fence for absolutely no reason, suddenly giving the people with crude homemade shivs complete power. \n\n\u25ba In summation: Trump was $4 billion in debt and the Russians [bailed him out](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/). They own him, and he loves them.\n\nI've reached my 10k limit and URLs are the first thing to go.

A lot of the reporting surrounding this major event is \\*wrong\\*\u2014so I'll try to report things accurately. I hope you'll read on and retweet.  \n>  \n>1/ At the risk of sounding like Mike Myers' famous SNL talk-show host Linda Richman, \"Mueller's final Trump-Russia report\" is neither \"Mueller's,\" final, about \"Trump-Russia\" or a \"report.\" So all the breathless \"reporting\" today suggesting otherwise is inaccurate and misleading.  \n>  \n>2/ What we call the \"Trump-Russia\" investigation is a web of criminal, counterintelligence, and Congressional investigations that intersect with the work of the Special Counsel's Office. So there are three key \"c\"-words here\u2014\"criminal,\" \"counterintelligence,\" and \"Congressional.\"  \n>  \n>3/ Special Counsel Mueller is part of the \"criminal\" investigation; Mueller's work \\*intersects\\* with the \"counterintelligence\" investigation; and his work feeds into and draws from the Congressional investigation. And here's the key: all three of these investigations are ongoing.  \n>  \n>4/ As part of the \"criminal\" investigation, Mueller investigated some things his office then prosecuted; he investigated some things his office handed off to others; he investigated some things he chose not to prosecute; he investigated some things he is letting Congress handle.  \n>  \n>5/ Mueller's \"criminal\" investigations\u2014that is, the information he derived during his nearly 24 months of \\*criminal investigative work\\*\u2014then fed directly into multiple \"counterintelligence\" investigations and will undoubtedly feed into many ongoing \"Congressional\" investigations.  \n>  \n>6/ The news we got today is that Mueller will not \\*himself\\* be bringing any more indictments. That's it. That's \\*all\\* that has just happened. Any reporting that says the \"Russia probe is done\" is false. Any reporting that \"Mueller's work is done\" is false. It is only what I said.  \n>  \n>7/ Focusing \\*exclusively\\* on what Mueller's office will be doing going forward and \\*exclusively\\* on the criminal investigation\u2014so, a small part of what we somewhat misleadingly call the \"Trump-Russia scandal\"\u2014we can see that Mueller may be done indicting (\\*maybe\\*) but that's it.  \n>  \n>8/ As of today, Mueller had ten attorneys working for him (himself not included, I believe) down from seventeen originally. But we found out this week that certain attorneys who \"left\" his Office will \\*still be doing work for it\\*. Why? Because the Office has some work left to do.  \n>  \n>9/ That Office, whether still formally constituted or not, will see its attorneys prosecute Roger Stone in November, eight months from now. It will see its cooperating witness Rick Gates participate in \"multiple\" ongoing federal criminal investigations. And that's just the start:  \n>  \n>10/ The Office will see its cooperating witness Mike Flynn testify in the Kian trial in July (Kian was a NatSec official on Trump's transition team whose case intersects with all the other parts of the Trump-Russia investigation). Flynn is also involved in \\*multiple\\* other cases.  \n>  \n>11/ The Office will continue to pursue grand jury testimony from a Roger Stone witness, and continue to pursue a substantial trove of documents (for its grand jury, which is seated through July as far as was last reported) from an as-yet unnamed state-owned foreign corporation.  \n>  \n>12/ The Office has\u2014it appears\u2014referred to DOJ for prosecution at least one man it previously promised to prosecute (Corsi) and presumably has referred to DOJ for \\*possible\\* prosecution a whole host of \"Trumpworld\" figures who Congress has recently accused of perjuring themselves.  \n>  \n>13/ We also heard from major media over the past few weeks that Bob Mueller's office was referring out an unknown number of new cases to other federal prosecutors, including presumably\u2014based on past cooperation and information-sharing practices\u2014prosecutors in SDNY, EDVA, and DC.  \n>  \n>14/ We \\*also\\* know from major media that there are many ongoing cases for which Mueller's office conducted some of the investigation, all of the investigation, or shared information with the case's primary investigators, such as Cohen's SDNY cases and the Maria Butina case in DC.  \n>  \n>15/ What some in the media decided\u2014I do not know why\u2014is that the only cases they would associate with Mueller would be (a) indictments Mueller's office brought, (b) that were completed before he issued any report to the DOJ, and (c) immediately (on their face) involved collusion.  \n>  \n>16/ So you have reporters today blithely saying that \"Mueller is done\" when Mueller will be prosecuting Roger Stone for most of 2019. You have reporters saying \"he's done\" when cases he initiated are not only ongoing in multiple jurisdictions but may well provide new intel there.  \n>  \n>17/ If Roger Stone decides to cooperate\u2014before or after conviction\u2014that's Mueller. The same is true for Kian. The same is even true for Manafort (who can cooperate to reduce his sentence for the next year). But the same is also true for the many cases Gates and Flynn are working.  \n>  \n>18/ The same is true for Butina. And for indictments that arise from the ongoing counterintelligence investigation(s). Or any new criminal referrals that go from Congress to DOJ. The same is true for cases Mueller began\u2014that then went elsewhere\u2014that could lead to new indictments.  \n>  \n>19/ The same is true for any cases that Mueller passed directly on to DOJ to let DOJ decide whether to prosecute them or not. In short, media can tell us today that \\*Mueller himself\\* will bring no new indictments\u2014but even that might be conditioned by what happens in Stone's case.\n\n&#x200B;"}, {"comment_id": "ej5l91r", "post_id": "b4agza", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "ej5mama", "post_id": "b4agza", "comment": "The bots are out strong.
