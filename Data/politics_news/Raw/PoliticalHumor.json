Years of TV has us thinking that the system is largely populated with people like the characters they see on TV, and that these organizations are always amply funded. They're not.

It's not suspicious that these things happened, it's *unsurprising*.\n\nEpstein was a narcissist who was finally caught and forced to finally see himself as he really was and to realize he no longer has any viable way out. So, he made his final arrangements with his lawyer, and then killed himself. It was pretty easy to do, because the prison he was held in is chronically underfunded and poorly staffed. There is plenty of awful shit in the world, especially right now, but we don't need to go making up new stuff because it feels good and it seems like that's what would happen in a movie.

Beyond that, and the reason I embellished into what I did, it is entirely reasonable to think that he thinks his threat to cut funding (I'm not sure what actually became of it) inspired others to look to new ways to find cures thereby making him in some way responsible for said new cures even though they were in the works long before he became POTUS.  Yes, that is taking a bit of creative license on my part.

Mueller's report has to be well thought out and articulate or all hell is going to break loose. \n\nWhy?\n\n Because if Mueller says \"Trump is innocent and is a victim in all of this mess\" it will piss off both the left and the right to the point they will both feel robbed and cheated. There are those on the left that have already made their minds up that Trump is guilty. On the other hand there are those on the right that will look back at the last two years and feel like Trump was crucified for no reason and that his policies were obstructed based on a false narrative that started from the beginning of his presidency. They will seethe with anger at the media more than they already do. They will feel like their loss of the house during the mid-term elections was based on lies. \n\n\n\nHow does the government craft a report that mitigates the explosive pressure that's built up around the expectation of this report? \n\nI know I'm in the den of anti-Trump land here in this sub but how will you react to the Mueller report if it shows Trump isn't guilty? I think those dudes over at Rpolitics will lose their fucking minds. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "eewke6l", "post_id": "ajjk51", "comment": "So Trump's backing the usurper in Venezuela which Russia is against and warned against..and he is a Russian puppet how?"}, {"comment_id": "eewl39s", "post_id": "ajjk51", "comment": "Yep.

The court then acts as a neutral decider looking at the person's perspective and makes a decision in their 'best interests'.\n\nThe difficulty in the baby Alfie case is that the court has accepted that Alfie's life cannot meaningfully be extended. They have decided that further treatment would impose unnecessary suffering on the child, so in child's best interests they have decided that Alfie should have palliative care only and be allowed to live his remaining days in as much comfort as possible.

One, who was reffered to only as Dr A, said these involuntary responses were generated by brain stem tissue and can happen any time as an \u201cauto-pilot response\u201d.\n\nHe was taken off of life support by the court as it is now not in the childs best interest to remain in the state that he is in now, it is more cruel to keep him alive in the state that he is in, rather than letting him pass.

Nixon was every bit as profane as trump and had deep insecurities, but acted decent in public.  JFK was an incredibly popular and well liked president, but had numerous affairs, though it's not clear whether allegations of an affair with marylin monroe really happened.\n\nBut if you go back far enough, I think you get similar shitshows. Andrew Jackson seems to have been a loose cannon and there are numerous infamous stories about him.  Ulysses S. Grant's was supposedly a terrible president with numerous scandals and there was a lot of corruption during his time.  Andrew Johnson, herbert hoover, etc, all pretty bad presidents.\n\nIt seems like political discourse really get transformed by the predominant form of media.  Before we had television and radio, politicians were much more open, because everything was reported by word of mouth and newspaper, so no soundbites out of context or need to word things perfectly.  Once you had radio and television, presidents became not only national leaders and public figures, but in a sense tv characters, with a careful media image.  In the age of social media, it seems like politicians get the most mileage by being memes and trolls.

They agree to the terms but most of the time they don\u2019t fully know what they\u2019re getting into.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis is how I ended up where I am today. I had no clue how much the cost really was in the end and how much interest I would end up paying. Cue long story time, read on if you dare. I am very long winded so I apologize in advance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThey got me in for a tour and fill me with wonder, then the real trick is to say the smallest numbers possible... Such as saying it's only $1500 per credit hour and you don't have to pay until 6 months after you are no longer in school, plus they will help you get Pell Grants, and it doesn't sound that bad. They brag that have the highest % of job placement and will help you get a good paying job as you near your graduation, which was an exaggeration at best.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHigh School was no help either with it came to understanding adult finances. I remember asking a few questions, but nothing set off any alarms for me at the time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe admission test to get in was being able to sign your name on the dotted line. They tell you they are nationally accredited, so you can transfer to another school down the road if you want..also a lie. Once you are in, you either quit or fail out and end up saddled with he debt and non-transferable credits, or you finish it out and at least get that paper that will get you considered for employment.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat I think was underplayed was that each class is 3 credit hours, and you take 3 per semester which is 18 credit hours per year. Then if you are a lazy kid who misses a few classes and has to retake a few, realize you suck at design with one semester left into a 2 year associate degree, finish that degree, switch majors to go ahead for a bachelor and before you know it you end up there for 5 years. Baseline cost? $135,000\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo, I did not finance the full amount. Pell Grants, and a mutual fund my grandpa and dad invested for me helped me get my bottom line down...but not much honestly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy then girlfriend now wife, also got sucked in, and due to her financing situation, she ends up with a lot more debt than me. 6 months after graduation we could not afford the equivalent of a mortgage payment that they wanted, each, and afford to live and care for our newborn daughter at the same time. We deferred when we could and made payments when we could, but ended up defaulting for several years, all the while building up massive amounts of compounded interest and fees. Our $4500 tax refund was garnished and absolutely killed us that year, but I guess that helped pay some of the interest?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe finally get to place where we might be able to afford making payments, but we are also sinking money into a rental property and have to get out if we want to have any financial comfort later in life. We spend several days calling the loans companies, straightening things out, even accepted a few settlement offers for a well discounted percentage. After several months if work, w get our credit scores back up some and a close friend fights tooth and nail to get us a house loan at an amazing rate in 2017 and our mortgage payment is not much more than what our rent was, so now at least we are building equity.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe rehabbed several loans in this period, and get on income based payment plans, which barely cover the interest accrued each month.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe have paid several thousands of dollars (30k+) these last couple of years, and it still feels like we owe the same amount we owed when we graduated. It is honestly sickeningly crushing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOnce a few of my loans were rehabbed I continued to autopay the agreed amount, but apparently once they are rehabbed the price changes, and they almost over drafted my account that month, so I turned it off and planned to call them and set up something manageable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course life happens and before I know it, I'm defaulted again. The collection company wants 50k, oh plus they added on 8k in collection fees...so that's fun. I am now trying consolidate them all at the average rate of the loans (6.25%) including all interest and fees. The rest of my loans with another company is attempting to garnish my wages but I am attempting to roll those into the loans the other company consolidating. Oh and our tiny $1200 refund was garnished again this year, but it hurts less this time.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nLook...I know it was my own dumbass fault for getting myself into this situation, and I am now doing what I can to pay this down and if I have to pay it all, so be it. But if I can do something to prevent this from happening to my and everyone else's children in America, I am willing to do what ever it takes.

Income is money made through labor.  Capital gains is money made from selling assets.  They are taxed in separate buckets.\n\n\nCapital gains value exponentially.  Your house doesn't gain, say,$10k/year.  It gains, say, 4%/yr, which makes it double every 18 years. (Exponential growth.)\n\nJeff Bezos isn't making $24 billion in income this year. He owns shares in a company.  That company reinvests money into building more, letting them increase profits every year.  Jeff doesn't take any of these profits.  The company posts very little profit (because it spent most of it's money on expansion), but grows a lot.  And thus, Jeff Bezos' ownership share grew by $24 billion.\n\n\nJeff Bezos didn't pay any taxes on that $24 billion.  **Not** because he cheated taxes- but because he didn't sell the shares.\n\n\n**You only pay Capital Gains taxes when you sell the shares.**  If you never sell the shares, it's never triggered.  This isn't a loophole- it makes sense, because otherwise you'd owe taxes every time your house went up in value and you'd be forced to pay for an appraisal every year and every time your house goes down in value you'd get a deduction and it would be a mess.\n\n\n\nMost billionaires simply never sell.  Bill Gates rode Microsoft up, and only started selling exactly what he needed to sell to buy things.  This let's them essentially dodge taxes until they die (then their kids pay the estate taxes, in theory).\n\n\n\nAnd when they do sell, it's not taxed as income, but as capital gains (at 15%). \n\nAlmost no one makes $10 million+ a year income that a 70% income tax would hit.  It would basically only hit celebrities (movie stars, football stars, lottery winners, etc).  It wouldn't hit Jeff Bezos or Warren Buffett or Bill Gates at all.\n\nYou may be thinking \"why not do a 70% capital gains tax bracket\"?   This would work better, but again, you have the problem where the billionaires will just never sell the shares.  Heck, if they really want to cheat, they can borrow money on their shares as collateral at 2% interest or less and spend *that*.\n\n\nThe Washington Post estimated this would raise $700 billion over a decade, assuming no one adjusts their behavior (big assumption).  That's only $70 billion a year- roughly the education budget.  Nothing to sneeze at, but not huge either- it's not going to pay for single payer healthcare.\n\n**In the end**, a 70% income tax wouldn't hit billionaires hard, and would raise very little income.\n\n**But**, it would give Fox News something to scream about over and over and over.  The political cost is higher than the worth.\n\nLong story short:\n\nElizabeth Warren's proposed wealth tax would be *way* more effective at raising revenue, forcing billionaires to actually sell shares to pay for it, and would actually probably give Fox News less of a club to scream about ('wealth tax on billionaires' sounds better than '70% of income').\n"}, {"comment_id": "ef9o3hn", "post_id": "al0xuw", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "efc2yks", "post_id": "al0xuw", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "efchwzg", "post_id": "al0xuw", "comment": "You know, I can kind of respect normal thieves.

Allow me to clarify the perception driving this so called racism:\n\nMost illegals are ethnically Mexican right? And it's safe to say that most natural born Americans don't give a shit about other foreign expats/immigrants because they aren't illegally crossing the border by the thousands every year? Some do sure but not at the same rate as Mexicans? Still with me? Good. \n\nSo when let's say, a white natural born American shows a lack of tolerance for illegal immigrants who cross the border and get free healthcare and benefits while citizens get squat, doesn't make for a racist issue. For the ethnicity could change in the future and Americans would be showing their disdain to them as well. But it's not racism. Could be confused for racism but at root, it's not the prime factor. Some of us recognize that immigrants/expats (from other well developed nations) are just that and most likely got into the country legally, whereas, sadly, and through no fault of their own, Mexicans have to cross because their government is fuck all shit at giving them a safe and prosperous country to live in.\n\nAlso, racism should never be used as a blanket term. It is a very specific state of mind: believing one's own race/ethnicity is SUPERIOR (key word here) to that of others.\n\nI have no doubts that a lot of white (or otherwise) Americans, who do not approve of illegal immigrants, are indeed racist. But as result of of their views regarding illegal immigration itself? I think not. \n\nYou're welcome and remember: God didn't want his son thinking for himself which is why he sent him to hell in the first place. Satan loves you more than Jesus and God ever did.

NYC and SF are often touted as the biggest examples, but this is a crisis affecting nearly every urban area in America. \n\nAnother problem is a complete lack of political desire to stop the crisis. People in these cities do not want to see their homes drop in price, they want their homes to constantly go up in price. The other big issue is that foreign investors often buy up luxury housing in many cities, keeping the luxury market extremely expensive, meaning rich people who would move into those apartments instead move to middle class housing, displacing people and raising prices for everyone. A vacancy tax, or a tax on foreigners buying property, would solve this. But homeowners want to keep prices rising, so the crisis continues. \n\nPeople who own 3,000,000 dollar brownstones in Brooklyn that they bought for 100,000 bucks in the 80s can deal with a fucking drop in their housing price if it means poor people can actually live in their neighborhoods. \n\nOur current housing economy entirely favors those who are older and wealthier and own homes.

Something you're good at, something you love, and preferably something you can monetize.  But I think where this argument loses any traction with people, but especially me, is that \"it's hard and someone else's fault\".  Who cares.  The problem is the problem.

From comeys stament:\n\nIn various interviews, Clinton has said that \"I did not send classified material, and I did not receive any material that was marked or designated classified.\"[104] However, in June and July 2016, a number of news outlets reported that Clinton's emails did include messages with some paragraphs marked with a \"(c)\" for \"Confidential.\"[105][106] The FBI investigation found that 110 messages contained information that was classified at the time it was sent. Sixty-five of those emails were found to contain information classified as \"Secret;\" more than 20 contained \"Top-Secret\" information.[107][108] Three emails, out of 30,000, were found to be marked as classified, although they lacked classified headers and were only marked with a small \"c\" in parentheses, described as \"portion markings\" by Comey. He added it was possible Clinton was not \"technically sophisticated\" enough to understand what the three classified markings meant[109][110][111] which is consistent with Clinton's claim that she wasn't aware of the meaning of such markings.[112] Clinton personally wrote 104 of the 2,093 emails that were retroactively[113][114][115] found to contain information classified as \"confidential.\"[54][116] Of the remaining emails that were classified after they were sent, Clinton aide Jake Sullivan wrote the most, at 215.[113] According to the State Department, there were 2,093 email chains on the server that were retroactively marked as classified by the State Department as \"Confidential,\" 65 as \"Secret,\" and 22 as \"Top Secret.\"[117][118] TG-4127 accessed Hillary for America Campaign Gmail accounts through spoofed login pages. Victims thought they were standard pages and hackers were able to access their email account.\n\n...\n\nHe added, \"Although there is evidence of potential violations of the statutes regarding the handling of classified information, our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.\"[164][165] With regard to mishandling of classified information, Comey said, \"there is evidence that they [Clinton and her team] were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information.\" The investigation found 110 emails that should have been regarded as classified at the time they were sent; another 2,000 emails were retroactively classified which means they were not classified at the time they were sent.[164][167] Comey said that \"any reasonable person in Secretary Clinton's position, or in the position of those government employees with whom she was corresponding ... should have known that an unclassified system was no place for that conversation.\"[168][169] The FBI learned that Clinton used her personal email extensively while outside the United States, both sending and receiving work-related emails in the territory of sophisticated adversaries. The FBI did not find \"direct evidence that Secretary Clinton's personal e-mail domain ... was successfully hacked;\" they assessed it \"possible that hostile actors gained access\" to it.[164][166] Investigators found that State Department employees often used private emails to conduct business. Comey noted, \"We also developed evidence that the security culture of the State Department in general, and with respect to use of unclassified e-mail systems in particular, was generally lacking in the kind of care for classified information found elsewhere in the government.\"[170]"}, {"comment_id": "ecp0o8g", "post_id": "aa34fp", "comment": "They're both idiots."}, {"comment_id": "ecp1bni", "post_id": "aa34fp", "comment": "Because it\u2019s all about gender.

That's saying that in Year 1 of a presidential term, the deficit for that single year was x and in the final year of that presidency, it was y. You conveniently left out EVERY year in between. For instance, the meme is saying that Obama \"halved it to 600 million\". All that means is that in Obama's final year, he was \"only\" over budget by $600 million, instead of the much higher numbers he had been over at the beginning of his term. However, that leaves out the 7 previous years where he had the 3 of the highest 4 annual deficits ever. Obama added a total of nearly $8.6 TRILLION to the overall national debt over his 8 years! In other words, Obama averaged a deficit of $848 billion every year whereas Bush averaged a deficit of $412 billion every year. Of course,the truth is that the President has very little to do with the deficit amounts, since Congress is the one that handles the passage of the spending bills. Now, that being said, the deficits we are experiencing since Trump took office are also still ridiculously high. Part of that, though, is the recognition that the mandatory costs (ie Medicare/Social Security) have been increasing (and will be increasing for a while).

His defense was that he doesn\u2019t think he is either one of the two in the racist picture, because he distinctly remembers wearing blackface on a different occasion.\n\nThat time, he says, he only applied a little bit of shoe polish to dress as Michael Jackson, because that stuff is hard to get off\u2026\n\nI wonder how he knew it was hard to get shoe polish off his face?\n\nIt was founded as a political organization to intimidate black and Republican voters in the south during reconstruction after the Civil War.\n\nAccording to History.com:\n\n[The KKK engaged in terrorist raids against African Americans and white Republicans at night, employing intimidation, destruction of property, assault, and murder to achieve its aims and influence upcoming elections.\nThere were two political parties\u2026 and the Ku Klux Klan aimed to influence elections AGAINST the Republican party](https://www.history.com/topics/reconstruction/ku-klux-klan)\n\nWell, that certainly sounds like Democrats started the KKK, doesn\u2019t it? And they started it for overtly political purposes.\n\nThe KKK was a political tool used by Democrats to help the Democratic Party win elections.\n\nAnd that is a FACT.\n\nOf course, another major strategy of covering up racist Democratic roots is saying that it isn\u2019t the party today that it once was.\n\nSome people even say the parties flipped at some point\u2026 so Democrats get credit for Lincoln (who was a Republican), and Republicans get credit for the KKK (which was founded by Democrats).\n\nWell, when exactly did the parties suddenly and miraculously switch platforms?\n\nNeither party added proposed anti-KKK positions to its platform at the 1924 conventions.\n\nIn 1963, the Democrat Governor of Alabama, George Wallace, stood blocking a doorway, refusing to allow a black girl to enter a white school that had just been desegregated by law.\n\nAnd if the Democrats were still racist in 1963, that means Democrat hero Franklin D. Roosevelt was part of the old racist Democratic party. (Big surprise, that the guy who put Japanese Americans in concentration camps was racist).\n\nome people would say that the flip occurred with the election of President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964. After all, George Wallace lost the primary against Johnson, which seems to be a rejection of Wallace\u2019s racism.\n\nPlus, Johnson signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n\nStill, only 69% of Democrats in the Senate voted for the Civil Rights Act, while 82% of Republican Senators voted for it. In the House, it was even worse, with just 63% of Democrats voting in favor, and 80% of Republicans supporting the legislation.\n\nHowever, Johnson went on to push \u201cGreat Society\u201d legislation throughout the rest of his Presidency, aimed at reducing crime and poverty, and expanding the welfare state and social safety nets.\n\nYou might think this would be a great thing to promote equality for disenfranchised blacks.\n\nBut historian, sociologist, and economist Thomas Sowell (who is black by the way) has a different perspective (emphasis my own):\n\n>Despite the grand myth that black economic progress began or accelerated with the passage of the Civil Rights laws and \u201cWar on Poverty\u201d programs of the 1960s, the cold fact is that the poverty rate among blacks fell from 87 percent in 1940 to 47 percent by 1960. This was before any of those programs began.\n\n>Over the next 20 years, the poverty rate among blacks fell another 18 percentage points, compared to the 40-point drop in the previous 20 years. This was the continuation of a previous economic trend, at a slower rate of progress\u2026\n\n>Nearly a hundred years of the supposed \u201clegacy of slavery\u201d found most black children being raised in two-parent families in 1960. But thirty years after the liberal welfare state found the great majority of black children being raised by a single parent.\n\n>The murder rate among blacks in 1960 was one-half of what it became 20 years later, after a legacy of liberals\u2019 law-enforcement policies.\n\nSo did the Democrats really abandon racist policies, or did they just change tactics?"}, {"comment_id": "erw9xrn", "post_id": "c4cof7", "comment": "Just because someone is \u201ccredibly accused\u201d as you say, doesn\u2019t mean they are immediately guilty.

How many times does this need to be said?\n\nThe founders literally just got done fighting a war against an authoritarian government using primarily civilian owned arms. The Battles of Lexington and Concord were literally started when the Redcoats tried to take a weapons cache. \n\nThe Federalist Papers are abundantly clear about why the 2nd Amendment was put in place. And it's not hunting or sport shooting. \n\nWe don't have an enumerated right to participate in any other sport, why would they include this one? Because it's not about a sport.\n\nEdit: to those saying a civilian population cannot outmatch a modern military with modern equipment, you are missing several pojnts.\n\n1. The founders were ok with private citizens owning cannons and warships. \n\n2. Repeating weapons were in existence and were attempted to be procured by the Continental Army.\n\n3. In the past 20 years, the US has been unable to put down 2 separate insurgency campaigns despite overwhelming comparative capabilities.\n\n3. Drones, fighters, and missiles cannot occupy and secure an area. That takes literal boots on the ground in the form of human soldiers. The kind of occupation the 2nd Amendment was precisely put there to fight. The British knew this in NI, the French in Algeria, and the Americans in Vietnam. All are examples of civilian resistance successfully (to a lesser extent in NI, they got a peace treaty) being a force to be reckoned with against a Great Power.\n\n4. In any likely civil war, the military would likely split. Some would remain loyal to the government but others would take their skills, training, and equipment to the civilian side.

We all see that there is the occasional genetic error. Sometimes they are visible such as person born without an arm. Sometimes they are internal, like a heart problem. You make a million people and one or two will have differences, you know? So surely most people can agree that it is possible for a person who appears to be one gender, might have the internal makeup of the other. We should understand and help this person. What we hate is the asshole that comes into the club one weekend saying he's decided he's now a woman and changes his mind two weeks later.

It\u2019s almost as if whether you like the person or not determines whether they are guilty or the victim of \u201cpolitical chicanery.\u201d\n\nPs. There is also the fact that Trump readily admitted to walking in on naked women at his beauty contests to Howard Stern.

I don't know if scaling the crimes of sexual deviancy is a bad thing or a good thing, I am just trying to look at this thru the eyes of an Alabama republican-type person.\n\nI think they see this Moore creature as a Godly man that took the children out to dinner before having sex with them. I see that people are saying that their parents agreed to this -- so it isn't technically rape? I really don't understand because I personally think under 18 cannot give consent.\n\nCertain leeway should be given for the couples that are 20/17, 19/16 and all that. I was one of those couples myself. I was 18 and dating a 15 year old (senior in hs, she was a sophomore). That's normal, I think.\n\nBut this guy was 30 something and the girls were like 14 and 16. That is unacceptable in the modern world. We aren't in the 1500s or whatever.\n\nI know I'm ranting, just thinking out loud here about why people would not only support the guy and give him a chance, but enough people would support him that he could (and will?) win this election.\n\nThis election is a perfect representation of our country right now, and it is in a great state to test it. I'd say your cliche vote-against-their-best-interests type of Trump voter is common in that state.\n\nI can't believe having sex with children has become a partisan issue. This is where we are at in 2017 with American politics, I guess.\n\nMan, this country could be so great if it wanted to.\n\nok rant over\n\nedit: i just wanna add, i have never been the militant-hate-religion type of atheist or agnostic, and I don't like it when people just bash religions for the sake of it. Just because you don't believe in something -- it doesn't make it stupid/pointless to the people that do.\n\nAnyway, this is one of the stories in recent memory that has really opened up my eyes to the religious right and their true beliefs, the fact that many of these people are basically the American version of a Daesh. Permitting a 30 something year old man having sex with children, *as well* as voting for him to lead the people of your state, that shit is straight out of an ISIS recruitment video. Add in the occasional abortion doctor killing/clinic bombing/shooting on the grounds of \"save the babies\" or whatever the fuck, and it becomes pretty clear that we have a substantial terrorist community in this country. I can't believe I was so blind to this before. We basically have a Christian ISIS in this country and the right-wing completely ignores it. Either that or they project it, there will be replies to this comment about the \"violent left\" and shit, just wait.\n\nAnyway that's something that I have noticed, it's just that this particular issue, having sex with kids and electing the guy to lead his state, this story could have came out of an old despot country in the middle east after we tore the place up. Radical right-wing beliefs. Obviously this is an extreme minority of the Christian population in this country (just like with Muslims and their radicals that terrorize), but to ignore it and act like it isn't the same exact thing is absurd. It's just the white version of it. And just like with Muslims, it is giving normal Christians a bad name, I feel sorry for you guys getting lumped in with these crazies."}, {"comment_id": "dqwlvq3", "post_id": "7i6apb", "comment": "Doesnt \"Tfw\" mean \"That Face When\"? \n\nWTF where is the face?"}, {"comment_id": "dqwmutv", "post_id": "7i6apb", "comment": "You see, there's the problem right there.

Pizzagate, Email scandal.\n\nIts just clear that Trump's only intent is to be the best and always be right. He will never admit being wrong once because he cannot be weak.

And Bannon is hammering it home.\n\nThis was one of the things which most worried me about Trump during the primary season, and its one thing which *really* set him apart from other Republicans. Trump never even pretending to care about civic virtues. He never extolled the virtues of democracy, of freedom, of law, of the constitution. He never said anything good about these things, because he doesn't care about that. \n\nThat's genuinely strange in American politics. Even people I despise - like Ted Cruz or Rand Paul - really seem to care about law and the constitution, *as ideas*. As things to refer to. If people remember back to 2008 and 2012, people who mock Romney for his weirdly pastoral homilies to the virtues of American goodness and the blessing that was our law and our constitution. It was funny. But at least Romney cared about it as an idea. Even Bush cared about it - we all remember how the White House Counsel's office would write these memos talking about how torture was legal. While many of us saw that as appalling, the Bush administration at least recognized that law is important. And if you want to do bad shit, you at least need to justify it in the context of the law. Because the law, the constitution, our civic norms - that's foundational.\n\nPeople need to understand that Trump is a genuine abberation here, and a staggeringly dangerous one.\n\nLaw doesn't just happen. It doesn't just run on its own. The existence of a legal system only matters if the people in charge of it actually care about it. Part of the success of democracy is that, historically, it has fostered a process whereby the people who are put in charge of institutions have a respect for the rule of law, and are bound by it - both at a moral level and institutionally.\n\nThis simply doesn't work if you elect people who don't give a shit. If you put someone in charge of the police, in charge of the military, in charge of the very organs of state power, who *doesn't care* about the rule of law, and appoints his deputies and their deputies on that basis, then the rule of law basically doesn't matter. There's nothing a judge or a legislature can do.\n\nLiberal Americans, of which I consider myself a proud member, don't seem to understand the extraordinary danger staring them in the face here. \n\nThe wolves are in the house. We have had this process set up for centuries aimed at keeping the wolves out. But we let them in.
