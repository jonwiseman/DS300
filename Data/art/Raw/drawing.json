As well as where to find me!\n\nARTISTS STATEMENT \n\u201cArt is something I always had an interest in, but the pursuit of which sometimes got lost for me in the race of life. Unfortunately I experienced a serious injury, which although traumatic, allowed me the chance to slow down and reassess my life. Creating art became a huge part of my recovery. Not only was it therapeutic physically, as it helped my regain strength and dexterity. But it also gave me a way to improve myself mentally, a way to see and appreciate what was around me, and a skill to harness and be proud of. Creation is an outlet to make sense of an otherwise senseless situation.\u201d\n\nBIO\nNathaniel is a 33 year old local artist, residing in Amesbury MA. He studied architecture at the Wentworth Institute of Technology, graduating in 2009. Upon graduation he went to work in his field, consulting for a local residential design firm. In early 2010 he relocated to St. Croix, in the US Virgin Islands to work in print & marketing as a graphic/web designer. He worked for close to a year until a serious car accident in December of 2010 left him paralyzed and without the use of his hands. He began drawing very simple pictures, with assistance, as therapy while in the hospital. After a few months, he moved back home and started in on a vigorous therapy schedule. As time passed by and he gained enough strength to draw on his own, his control and ability slowly increased. After concentrating mainly on black-and-white pen drawings for the first year or so, he started introducing color to his projects using Photoshop and eventually moved on to painting. Computer aided graphics have become a large part of his creative process. Most of his drawings and paintings are laid out and experimented with in Photoshop before putting pen or paint to paper and canvas. From his home studio, Nathaniel works mainly in pen and ink, watercolor, or oil paint. Spending much of his time experimenting with styles in his work, he also is commissioned often to create traditional portrait paintings of people and animals.\n\nFIND ME\nIG: @natebibaud\nFB: Nathaniel Bibaud Art & Design\nSTORE: flatearthdesigns.etsy.com\nWEB: nathanielbibaud.com"}, {"comment_id": "dwpivvt", "post_id": "897dg6", "comment": "artist and OT here--first off, fucking beautiful work. watercolors suuuuck and you clearly have a great command over them. secondly, where was your break?

She just got back from an art camp that was held on a college campus and I\u2019m trying to find anything and everything I can to encourage her to use her amazing talent. She never thinks her artwork is good enough, even when it\u2019s brilliant. I would love for her to go to college for art so she can learn new skills. When you decided on that project for your students did you just reach out to a college and ask if their art department would do that, or did you know someone in the art program there? I love your idea, unfortunately, my daughter is homeschooled, so she doesn\u2019t get the individual art experience with an actual art teacher like you. I would love to have a college student let her shadow them through their program, or ask if a professor would allow her to sit in on a couple of art classes just to see what it\u2019s about. Any suggestions on how to do that (or any other way to encourage her to pursue her talent) would be greatly appreciated.

My school didn't have a dedicated art program at that age (it was more time off for the teacher as we furiously scribbled away) and by the time I had actual art lessons I had already decided I was hopeless and kinda zoned out during them.

The pigment mixing problem is not an issue for computers as they simply emit wavelengths of light that mix in our brains.

It's so fucking hard. So hard. I take my meds. I see my docs, I do the things I'm supposed to but I always still feel like I'm just one errant word away from unraveling, from this whole house of cards collapsing and leaving me a gibbering mess, exposing the raw, angry wounds on the inside I try so hard to hide. I've been doing this for the better part of a decade. It doesn't get better. Just easier.\n\nI know how reddit works. I'm fine people. Really, I am. I have my reasons for being these days, reasons to keep trying to be better than the day before. I'm just tired. World weary. Its unimaginably hard to live with. Depression is a nightmare on it's own, the strength and willpower it takes just to get out of bed most days, just to do *normal*. Then I have to put on the mask. I have to look myself in the mirror every day, paint a smile on my face, hide the pain that even **I** can see in my eyes, and go out and pretend I'm okay. I have to pretend I haven't seen the absolute worst in humanity. I have to pretend I'm not constantly on edge and angry and that I'm only angry because its easier than confronting the gaping hole in my heart where sadness lives. I have to pretend that I don't think numerous times a day that I *should be* dead, that I *wish* I was dead, that I would trade places with friends who are dead, that I miss being deployed, and that I could just walk into the woods and never walk out. I have to live with that and my own personalized, monogrammed book of nightmares, every day, and pretend I'm fine because a decade after the fact no one cares. I should be fine now right? I'm still employed and standing on my own right? Barely, but that's all that matters. I'm on my feet, those wounds will heal.

Keep drawing every day and your skill will continue to grow fast. \n\nEDIT: Some constructive advice: Keep thinking about where the light is and where it falls, the same way you were when you rendered the neck. The more you eliminate lines or \"strokes\" the more realistic your work will look. If you find lines and instead, change them into \"differences in lighting\" you'll see your work start to really pop. \n\nYour neck is a perfect example, shade your neck up to where it meets your chin, gradually getting darker on the way up, but then *create* the line of your jaw by shading up to the bright edge of your chin. So there is no actual dark \"line\" along it, but a sudden change in light value. \n\nHope that makes sense.

I scrolled right by and my brain went, \"wait a second,\" and I went back up to find this.\n\nThe details are absolutely amazing and I think that the artistic touch conveys even more about this animal than the photo does. Like for example. the bridge of the nose and paw - in a photo you're able to tell they are fluffy, probably, but the way you drew them somehow emphasizes that so much that I know exactly how the floof must feel. The differing orange/brown tones you used in the fur for shape are just, wow. You really captured the density of the fur, the way it dents and curves along the face. There is also a lot of depth and color to the eyes. Looks really good.\n\nThat tree bark is beautiful, too. It looks burned? Like the trees after a controlled forest fire.\n\nYou are a really, really great artist. You are especially talented in the fact that you're able to copy a photo over so perfectly into a drawing while also retaining some of your own personal style and interpretation to it.\n\nIn this situation, the art is much, much more beautiful and enchanting to look at than the original photo.

Where as it is indeed great that museums support young artists - i find it reallly unfitting to promote this kind of art along side old classical oli paintings... Those were masters, they studied for years, it's our cultural heritage and putting a simple cratoon drawing beside it as an equal, well, to me that's fairly unfair. Of course cartoony style is valid, I am sure you took a lot of care and time to make the piece but I believe such styles as yours and the other one are uncomparable at all. Imho (please don't beat me!!) they should at least create a whole new section for modern art but not hang it like it's some old time classic because it's almost an insult.\n\nI hope you understand what I mean and don't take that personally!"}, {"comment_id": "eyt5a1h", "post_id": "cyl80p", "comment": "you copies vexx  you little bich"}, {"comment_id": "ezstnie", "post_id": "cyl80p", "comment": "Why is it with the ancient Chinese paintings?"}, {"comment_id": "eyt6ob1", "post_id": "cyl80p", "comment": "Bragging isn't a very good trait to have, just some advice.

The bolt should also be behind the barrel and always connected in some way to the barrel itself. to put it simply the ammo goes into the bolt which is connected to the trigger and barrel. Also the barrel is too large on this gun, the barrel should be slightly larger than the cartridge it fires so if you want a gun with a large barrel like that its either got to shoot a large projectile or have a lot of small barrels (unless of course its an oil or water sleeve over the main barrel for cooling purposes.)
