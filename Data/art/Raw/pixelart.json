I\u2019ve tried doing similar things with pixel art in the past (mixing 3D or more realistic effects while still retaining the pixel art style), and I think you really pulled it off here. I especially like the addition of the line highlight around all the edges. Although I have to say that\u2019s where you\u2019ve puzzled me with the effect. It looks like you\u2019re using a displacement map to do the refraction (might be a normal map since you\u2019re also highlighting the sunlight reflecting off the surface), and then I assumed you\u2019d be using a heightmap and that\u2019s how you\u2019re understanding if any given pixel is submerged (that\u2019s approach I\u2019ve taken in the past). But the more I look at it, the more it looks like the water is actually staying level, it\u2019s just the line highlights which shift up and down creating the illusion that the water is going up and down. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m wondering if this is actually just creative use of how you\u2019re tiling the water/the transparent texture, and then it\u2019s just the the line highlight that\u2019s giving the illusion of added depth. Which if that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s actually pretty clever and a good way of avoiding having to add a lot of additional work to a 2D pipeline. \n\nAlso took a look at your progress and the game looks really good so far, I really like the over all style and charm of it."}, {"comment_id": "f1n0aci", "post_id": "da3npf", "comment": "Looks pretty good to me :)"}, {"comment_id": "f1n1rj1", "post_id": "da3npf", "comment": "looks perfect!

While I think it would look amazing in a game, this particular tree would be very noticeable if you reused it often in the same scene. \n\nWith that said, between custom brushes and iterative processes, the actual time to draw it could likely be sped up considerably. Using the individual hand-placed leaves to create clusters of leaves, or entire branches, and use those to construct similar trees  in a quicker fashion.

See [this photo](https://www.flickr.com/photos/red_dog_photo/8723853397/) for reference.\n* Waves are about the same size at every place in the lake, but they'll look smaller and smaller with distance. That means that the top part of your reflection needs way less moving displacement.\n* Water, at distance, reflects more like brushed steel than like quicksilver. Most of the reflection will be static, with only tiny variations added from movement. Your reflection makes the lake look very small, something like a goldfish pond.\n* The halo around the sun is supposed to be incredibly bright. You've correctly added bloom to show that, but that's actually a lens effect and shouldn't show up in the reflection. Also, because the sun is much brighter than the monitor can show, the reflection needs to be *way* more vertically spread.

The combination of your objects and theme makes this extremely cool/good looking. Fantasy car racing next to clouds near pyramids? Sure, why the hell not! I also just noticed there are a lot of eyes (the sky, the wheels, the wings). The perspective and \"moving speed\" is also on point. The colors are great. I could stare at this for hours...\n\nDo you have a social media account(s) I could follow for your content?\n\nEdit: For some reason, this is giving me a \"retro wave\" vibe although it lacks the major components (neon colors, retro icons). It must be the racing car? I was thinking... if you were to change the color scheme to incorporate the black and neons... and some some retrowave/synthwave music while the gif loops, it would be pretty neat! Or keep the current colors and add some EDM... yeah!

"}, {"comment_id": "dk1fchq", "post_id": "6mf4iv", "comment": "A few things:\n\n1: I think the train moves too many frames at a time, makes the animation pretty choppy. If you use Photoshop, I recommend animating with the timeline feature, because you can use keyframes there. With simple animations like this train simple going from left to right, it's really easy to set up a smooth animations that way. (Looks like you moved the train by hand, frame by frame here. I used to make the same \"mistake\", I really urge you to try timelines even if it's a little confusing in the beginning, stuff like keyframes make animating much less tedious)\n\n2: The leaves falling down from the plants don't look at all natural, it's really rigid. They should genuinely move (with the wind, if there is any) in more smoother, \"rounder\" motions. As it is, it looks really jarring to be honest. This kind of animation fits better with snow, but even then, the particles should move to the right (or the left, whatever) simultaneously.\n\n3: Just in general, this feels a little lifeless. Adding a number of small details can really help bring the piece to life and inject it with a greater sense of mood and atmosphere. Some things I could imagine working well here: Add wind (coincides with my previous point). The leaves could move a little, the power lines from the lamp could also do so. A lamp flickering once in a while, as if it's somewhat broken (granted, this works better in a night time scene, but even here it would look great I think). You could also rotate the crane in the background.\n\nIf you want to go the extra mile, you can add a ripple effect to the water. However, this has to be done right or else it will look bad. If done right though, it adds so, so much to the piece. Right now, it looks a little off not having the water move at all. It does take a lot of effort, but I can assure you every bit of effort is worth it, even it can be tedious sometimes.\n\nJust to explain it further: Looking at [this piece I made](https://www.reddit.com/r/PixelArt/comments/5uybyu/oc_view_over_a_japanese_city_animated/) (also very much inspired by 1041uuu), you can see how the little things really make the whole thing work. Stuff like the smoke coming from the building on the left hand side, the tower rotating, the leaves moving with the wind, the bird moving in a couple of different motions, the clouds moving even just a single pixel, one of the lamps flickering once in a while all add a lot of depth for comparatively little effort. Also, here you can see how helpful keyframes can be. The train is really smooth, which would be impossibly tedious to recreate by hand. You can also use keyframes on smaller objects (like the cars on the highway in the background), provided they have simple start and end points.\n\n4: Minor point, but the tower on the left hand side kind of looks like a paper cutout in an otherwise three dimensional cityscape. This is due to the single line of shading on the right side, makes it look two dimensional. Not shading it would have looked better, like the mountains in the distance.\n\n___\n\nHope these things help. Also, sorry if I came of a bit rude, but I wanted to explain everything clearly and be honest since you got potential here."}, {"comment_id": "dk2arwz", "post_id": "6mf4iv", "comment": "This reminds me a lot of Seattle"}, {"comment_id": "dk13vfh", "post_id": "6mf4iv", "comment": "I agree with the train!

Have the birds pause at both the left and right.  Their constant motion draws my eye away from the overall scene.\n4. Maybe increase the contrast a little on the background somehow.  Having all the contrast in the foreground makes the background feel very subdued.  You could maybe get some purple/orange/yellow in the sky? I think you have the sky gradient possibly backwards.

I feel for the animation one item should be in motion or all of it. If you go for all of it, I think a water shimmer, smog/cooling tower clouds, cloud motion, glint of light on the lamp, and plant sway, or anything else you can think of. Additionally, the scene might gain more depth if you moved the lamp to the right and opened up the middle some. Shadows on some buildings could be rethought. I imagine the sun wouldn't hit them in the way you have them shaded sometimes. A little boat might add another layer. And I wonder how the shore runs to the base of the skyscrapers. Just a lot of thoughts. I really liked your animation/image/thing, it gives me a sitting on a park bench vibe."}, {"comment_id": "dk1r94z", "post_id": "6mf4iv", "comment": "Wonderful work!
