The entire GIF is shot on ONE lens/focal length. The dolly-zoom effect in the 2nd part is actually digital (the creator zoomed in at the same rate of the camera moving back).\n\nThere are actually many resources to research about this. It clears the misconception that focal length creates compression. Focal length does not, distance does. A longer focal length simply forces you to stand further - hence everything will look compressed due to paralax effect (maybe paralax I'm not too sure).\n\nAn understandable example would be this: hold an apple one meter from your camera at night, it will look 10 times as big as the moon. Now move the apple further away from the camera a few dozen steps, it will look exactly as big as the moon. The focal length never changed, but if you cropped in on the 2nd picture, the moon is as big as an apple.

Now follow it as you move the phone closer, continue until basically as close as the eyepiece will allow while maintaining the bright circle in the centre of the camera. By now it will appear as a circular image roughly in the middle of your screen. Make minor adjustments as needed. For advanced results, change your metering to spot mode, and even adjust manual exposure, sometimes you need to dial it down a half stop or so to get a more balanced exposure.

Perhaps instead of judgement calls regarding basic questions, we'll try to redirect types of questions like \"which camera should I buy\" or \"nikon vs canon\" or \"mirrorless vs dslr.\"\n\n/u/ccurzio is by far our most active mod, thus many of your mod interactions will be with them - please stop and think, for a moment, that that means _they are doing the most to make this place good_ and they are, in fact, a real person.

My thoughts on the whole situation:\n\nI'm surprised at how quickly mods were willing to open the questions floodgates.  If I were a (more) cynical person I'd say that this was an intentional effort to show us how quickly the sub goes to shit with unrestricted questions.  I've definitely seen an uptick in questions that really don't belong on the front page of the subreddit.\n\nDid anyone consider, yanno, an _intermediate step_?  I've felt like the \"submitting to r/photography\" notes has been too strongly worded for a while, especially with the \"When in doubt, post in the question thread only, without making a separate post.\"  I think a much more reasonable starting point would've been making the question megathread a gear question megathread.  Many shallow questions are gear related anyways.  Add \"basic technique\" to that and  you'd probably catch most of them.  Add a few examples of questions that belong and don't belong in the question megathread under the new policy and I think people would be less scared off.\n\nSide note: I keep on seeing people say that the vast vast majority of questions in the megathread get answered.  Yes, usually by three or four comments.  For some questions, that's appropriate.  What I think (what I hope?) most people who are complaining about things getting buried are actually complaining about are questions which could've prompted more substantial discussions getting the same 2-4 responses as \"should I upgrade from the 5d2 to the A7iii\".\n\n*Anyways*, **I don't consider \"too many questions put into the megathread\" to be the core of the problems with this sub**.  With 600k+ subscribers why couldn't we get more activity on the posts that remained?  I rarely saw much discussion on articles about the art side of photography when they get posted here.  The top post here is about Net Neutrality ffs.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\nPortfolio/image series critiques.\n\nFor the first full weekend of every month, you can post a (cohesive) set of 8-24 pictures.  Then people can give feedback, with an emphasis on the overall thematic content (and less \"you're backfocused here, you needed to stop down there, is your monitor calibrated?\").  I think this is closer to what people do in art schools.\n\nMaybe even have themed months: street, landscape, travel, whatever.  I don't have any firm belief that I picked the right time intervals/number of photos.\n\nBasically, I'm trying to find a niche not currently filled by r/pics, /r/itookapicture, or /r/photocritique, that's both unlikely to result in a ton of spam and also going to bring content to the sub that we don't currently have."}, {"comment_id": "e436qwm", "post_id": "96rwhs", "comment": "I don't want to be that guy but the community has to share a lot of the blame on this one. any good advice given on this sub is quickly met with vitriol from people who seem to not have much experience and you quickly regret ever telling the cold hard truth, and if not, is quickly met by silence from the people taking the advice. a quick \"thanks\" goes a long way guys. it's the only reward there is, because at the end of the day you have to realise that giving our competition tips on how to compete with us is not really something we need to do."}, {"comment_id": "e42s9l7", "post_id": "96rwhs", "comment": "This is how I know you haven't been here for 6 or 7 years, or at least not been paying attention to the sub, cause if you were you would know **everyone** was complaining about all these general photography question posts so the mods started putting them in weekly threads.\n\nThen people were complaining that they weren't seeing any good content so the mods decided to allow some general questions posts again.\n\nThen **everyone was complaining** that there was way too much general crap question posts, so the mods moved everything back to weekly threads.\n\nAnd here we are now, the cycle continues again with your post complaining that there aren't any general questions posts anymore..\n\nYou just can't win.

These \"questions go here\" weekly megathreads are implemented in the first place because the new tab was probably a constant sea of the same noob questions.

Thanks.\"\n\nI think it comes down to being a (possibly inadvertent) power struggle between the dedicated regulars of the community who have /r/photography on their bookmark bar or whatever, and the more casual visitors and subscribers. The former group  wants to weed out the crap so they don't have to sift through it looking for high-quality discussions, and that's an understandable desire. But I think as communities grow they have to decide who they'll cater to. Reddit has limits and you can't please everyone. At the end of the day, it's just a discussion board. But one thing that's worked for the community I moderate (which is different in that it's a support community, but the same principle could apply,) is having a discord channel where the regulars hang out and talk about what they want, and the new tab is what it is. (Still subject to some moderate posting rules to keep things relatively substantive.) You create a new resource that scratches that itch for your most dedicated users, but it's very much connected to what you've already built.\n\nEdit: Aaand only after writing that did I check the sidebar to see the irc/slack links.

If you weren't doing anything wrong, hurting anyone else or putting yourself in danger, you should have nothing to fear from a cop. \n\nSince the drug war began, we've lost this connection. Suddenly I have to worry about the cops, even if I feel I've done nothing wrong. The drug war has made everyone (especially minorities) a potential criminal and therefore suspicious to cops. It's no longer just violent people that can be arrested. And in turn there is a contempt that much of the public has for cops as a result of the fear of being arrested for something they feel isn't wrong. That and the recent crackdown on peaceful protestors in the Occupy movement has only widened the gap. It's created this good guy - bad guy dichotomy that used to be good guy - armed good guy. \n\nAs a pot smoker and a protestor, even if I have nothing on me and I'm doing nothing wrong, I have this general fear of cops. This anxiety that runs through me anytime I see or hear one. And that feeling makes me hate them when they're around. It make me feel unsafe when it should be the opposite. When everyone agrees that the people being arrested deserve it, then I think there will be a sea change as everyone who isn't a criminal anyway will feel safe around cops.

This contract offers a professional photographer access to the event, and the right to sell those pictures to a publication. \n\nThe contract also helps the artist control which publications get to run pictures of them. Maybe TS doesn't want photo's of her performance in High Times, or spreads of her NYC performance completely saturating the music magazines the same month Rolling Stone is doing a big article on the same performance. Whatever the reason, the artist has the right to control how their image (in a private event) is being used. \n\nIf the artist wants to use that picture in future promotional work (the non commercial part of this section of the contract is important - it means the Artist can't go and sell posters of the photo without first getting a commercial licensing agreement from the photographer) they need to get written consent of the publication.   This seems incredibly fair to me. It's a contract after all - TS is giving the photographer access to content (her performance) and allowing the photographer to photograph that content and sell it to a publication. In exchange, the artist gets to use that photo in a non commercial setting. \n\n**TLDR** - The photographer is getting a pretty good deal. If he doesn't like it, he can always photograph public parks and retain complete control over the photo. Private events = restrictions.

These tiny amounts accumulate to something substantial if it is consumed by millions of people. \n\nIn the photography case, it's a different business model.  You get paid a more substantial amount for the picture, but you don't get the republication amounts. \n\nFor instance, one single play of a Taylor Swift song may be 0.2 cents of revenue for her.  But if it gets played 12 million times over the course of 3 months, that could be a substantial amount of money for her. \n\nWith photography at a Taylor Swift concert, it's a different structure.  You can take a picture and sell it for a couple hundred bucks, but by taking that money, you are agreeing that you won't get those small peruse amounts. \n\nApple very easily could have structured their business the same way.  They could have told artists \"we will pay you $5k per song, but we get to use it forever without additional obligation\".  But they didn't. \n\nBut in either case... The one up front payment, or the tiny payments for perpetuity.... The artists are getting paid for their work.  No one is being asked to work for free. \n\nBut in the case of what apple did, they said \"we are going to pay you this agreed upon amount for your songs, but we are going to use it for 3 months for free\". \n\nNow, in both cases the artist can choose not to do business.  Taylor chose not to agree to those terms.  And photographers can choose to not work her shows.   And they could do the same thing she did.  They could call her out publicly for the terms of her contracts.  (just like this article did) \n\nBut it doesn't make her a hypocrite.  Photographers at her shows get paid.

This should help to measure jumps in daylight when the car jumps on something (which is in general more horizontal than vertical like the edge of a table or other edges). This feature is useful because the small distance between their eyes doesn't give much parallax-effect to measure distances. Bigger cats like lions have more distance and more parallax-effect.

When that cat zeroes in on it's prey, that's all it's looking at, so whatever the cat is focusing on is going to be tack-sharp, even as the background and foreground melt away.\n\nThe lens of a human eye focuses different wavelengths in different areas at slightly different angles and, like a prism, causes aberration.  The light at the edge of the lens is focused more than the light in the middle. Human pupils also don't open nearly as much as a cat's. If a human pupil opened as large as a cat's the image would be blurrier because of the chromatic and and spherical aberration, and if a human's pupil was slit, the image would be distorted. A cat's eye has concentric rings with different focal lengths that focus all wavelengths of light to the same point, this is why a cat can still see when their pupil is a slit or a circle.\n\nWhile cats can see in almost any light level, they can only see intermediate distances well. They can't see things right in front of their face (hence the whiskers to feel) and they can't see over longer distances.

Because each eye has a different vantage point and tour brain aligns each image so only the thing your looking at is clear the rest appears less clear.

I can't imagine the odds of this happening but a few tips as we insure a ton of photographers.\n\nIf you're running a business (making a single dollar from photography), do not insure your gear on your personal policy. Get a business policy. We insure several hundred photographers through the Hartford, and unless you're making more than 200k, teaching workshops, or have on-payroll staff, you can expect a premium of about 500 bucks. I saw making a dollar because in the event of a claim, your homeowners insurance is going to look for any presence of business use of your gear. A Facebook page, a website... anything that has rates posted and yes, they will even go into a way back archive to look for something.\n\nRecord all the serial numbers of all your gear. Take pictures of everything down to the filters and light stands. Save receipts. Take a picture of those too.\n\nPut a geo tracker in the seam of your bag (no one seems to check the rain pouch pocket on my DaKine bag). We have had people locate stolen gear using the Tile App which was pretty cool.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of shared limit policies like you get through associations. You can get your own policy with better coverage, international coverage, and you don't have to worry about your insurance running out because another member blew out the limits with a death claim (thx Trash the dress drowning).\n\nIf you own a Jeep, you will get your gear stolen. It's just a proven thing."}, {"comment_id": "de9vrun", "post_id": "5wc2lj", "comment": "Do I get an honorable mention for suggesting you check pawn shops and classifieds?  j/k glad it worked out man."}, {"comment_id": "de8xasj", "post_id": "5wc2lj", "comment": "How are you making sure that this theft won't happen in the near future? \n\nTreat the Pawn shop owner right."}, {"comment_id": "de8wum9", "post_id": "5wc2lj", "comment": "This made me feel so good and I am gonna go check all my serial numbers and record them. \n\nSo happy for you!"}, {"comment_id": "de90wnc", "post_id": "5wc2lj", "comment": "Can i have a link to the original post?"}, {"comment_id": "de92hfu", "post_id": "5wc2lj", "comment": "Do that pawn shop a favor back and give them good business reviews"}, {"comment_id": "de9fg11", "post_id": "5wc2lj", "comment": "You lucky shit!

Every now and then we get a really good discussion going.\n\nI'm a pro photographer too, and I have some thoughts to go along with yours.  \n\n>1. It's more about equipment than we'd like to admit.\n\nThis is true and it is not.  Yes, yes, I know, a cop-out -- let me explain.  It is certainly true that with better lenses and a more capable camera you will be *able* to crank out much better work than others -- but *able* is the key word here.  I have met plenty of people who bought themselves cameras that made me jealous who produced work that nobody would want, and I know a guy who cranked out photos with a point and shoot Sony camera 8 years ago that are still being used by advertisers, on book covers, and have probably been forwarded to you in the email by your elderly grandparents.  Whether it's raw talent or experience, the camera operator matters a lot.  I've seen this even apply to myself; I have photos I took with a disposable camera and with a 1948 Kodak folder that I've actually RM licensed to advertisers.  Most of the stuff I shot when I was starting photography was on a (for the time) high end EOS-3 with nice lenses, and a lot of that stuff was crap.  I know people who don't call themselves photographers and who shoot with an iPhone and create images that blow my mind.  With photography, I really do believe talent is the biggest factor.  \n\nThat said, when it comes to business, if you want the extremely unenviable and underpaid job of being a photojournalist, then yes, equipment will help your portfolio big-time.  You are correct that shooting, say, college football without the big glass is going to result in a less than stellar portfolio.  There are some specialties, such as wildlife and sports, where only certain kinds of (very expensive) equipment will do the job, and anything less means poor work,.  Similarly, it's hard to land a commission job for high-end advertorial if you don't have anything in your portfolio that shows off expensive lighting or good post work.  Equipment does matter.  But I really don't think it's the largest factor.  \n\n>2. People are doing some unethical shit with RAW and nobody really understands or cares.\n>Photoshopping the hell out of photos is a nono in photojournalism, we all know this. And yet I see portfolios and award compilations come to our desk with heavy artificial vignetting, damn-near HDR exposure masking and contrasts with blacks so deep you could hide a body inside them.\n>When I question anybody about this they say \"oh yeah, well I didn't do anything in CS5, just the raw editor in Lightroom real quick so it's okay, it's not destructive editing, the original is still there.\"\n\nThis is a topic near and dear to my heart, for in addition to being a pro photographer I used to be the digital pre-press color correction guy for a metro newspaper.  I think the fellows at Poynter (who came to give us occasional pep talks) have their heart in the right place but get their knickers in a bunch over some odd things.  The typical photojournalism approach to image sanctity is far too concerned with rules and far too unconcerned with principles.  Many types of \"unrealisms\" are accepted while others are not.  Silhouettes are something that people rarely perceive with their eyes and brains, for example, and most photos of silhouettes that you see were shot in conditions where if you were actually standing there you would not have perceived a silhouette.  But for years it was a limitation of the equipment and unavoidable at times (and pretty at others), so it was allowed.  Now you have cameras with much better dynamic range and you find people rendering scenes in a way that were previously impossible and these scenes are declared \"unreal\".  They're not unreal, they're more closely matching real perception (which is a bunny that will never be caught -- all photographs lie, and have to by their very medium), but because we are not used to how they look, we label them as being unreal.  Similarly, long exposure, an accepted technique in photojournalism, creates scenes that temporally did not exist in one moment (and did not look that way to the viewer).  We're totally cool with that, but if someone uses several photos of the same scene (taken in temporally much shorter an amount of time than a typical long exposure shot) to expand the dynamic range of the shot to something close to what our eyes see, that's a no-no.  Or, for example, we are totally okay with using 400mm lenses even though our eyes do no perceive the world in any way shape or form like a 400mm lens does.  And of course there is flash -- and artificial light source (the photographer is affecting the scene!) that is in no way like the light that actually existed at the scene and existed temporally for such a brief period of time that nobody present noticed it.  But hey, for years low-light photography wasn't possible with film, so I guess flashes are okay still.  There is also (IMO) an irony that most papers will be okay with you doing things \"analogous to a darkroom\", since that's a standard they all understand.  But there are direct analogies in most of the things in Photoshop to what you can do in the darkroom, so this standard doesn't really mean anything.  Localized curve adjustments aren't much different than dodge and burn and I can make any photo look like almost anything using localized curve adjustments.  \n\nBut all of this is moot, really, since I can assure you that the digital pre-press guys in the dark room with the big CRTs that you hand off your photos to (and whom, it seems, all photojournalists just assume do some kind of magic and try never to think about) are going to hammer the everloving HELL out of your images in Photoshop to try to get them to look halfway decent in on crap-ass newprint.  You would probably be APPALLED to learn the liberties the pre-press guys take with your photos to get the colors to look right, but if this step isn't done, your photos will look like buttprints on buttpaper.  \n\n>But it doesn't seem like anybody cares. Some of the shit on the wire services looks exactly the same so they got jobs somewhere.\nThat dude that got canned from The Blade for photoshopping basketballs where there were none? He's found redemption- I remember reading an article where some editor says \"oh he sends us the raw files so we know its kosher now.\"\n\nNot sure what's wrong with this -- getting the RAW files IS a good way to see what's been done to an image.  Either that, or use the National Geographic standard of sending a TIFF file with all the adjustment layers intact.  If I send you a RAW file, not only can you see what I've done to a photo but you can revert it with the click of a button and do whatever the hell you want to do to it.  RAW files are definitely one way to verify that shooters aren't doing anything to a photo you don't want them to do.  \n\n>F*cking storm chasers are the worst offenders at this shit. Guess what he does now.\n\nThis is the post that keeps on giving -- I'm a storm chasing photographer, too!  I never realized Allan was the Toledo Blade guy.  \n\nStorm chasers in general do tend to do a lot of post processing work to their images. I try to do less than most.  (Sadly, some of the original images have expired off of the image host, but I have an example of what I typically do here: http://www.stormtrack.org/forum/showthread.php?9066-Extreme-Photoshopping&p=107289&viewfull=1#post107289 ).  That said, my general audience is not editorial but rather creative clients (they pay a lot better!), and in my agencies I don't claim that my shots are photojournalistic, though frankly the great majority of them I'd be comfortable submitting to a newspaper to go with a story about weather.  My philosophy on the processing of storm photos is to try to give an impression of what it was like to be there.  This means (if possible) not having the ground be a complete shadow, not having the sky be blown out, and not having clouds that were really damn dark render as a washed-out grey.  \n\nThe chasers out there tend to be very good at self policing.  Years ago, there was some jackalope submitting fake tornado video to the AP (he'd take old tornado video he shot, flip it horizontally, and then submit it as recent video he shot of a tornado that was in the news).  A couple of chasers recognized one of his flipped shots from a storm they'd seen years prior and started [a huge thread about it](http://www.stormtrack.org/forum/archive/index.php/t-17369.html).  I got them in touch with the AP National newsdesk, and the guy's work was retracted (and presumably he's blackballed from the AP).  \n\nThere are probably only 5 or 6 really, really good storm photographers in the world.  It's a great niche to shoot!  It's quite a bit harder and often much more boring than you'd think, but it can be incredibly rewarding.  \n"}, {"comment_id": "c3kh7f8", "post_id": "ovy78", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "c3kh6ht", "post_id": "ovy78", "comment": "\nYep, all of that sounds about right. But these things mostly apply to the genres of photojournalism, sports and wedding photography. These are genres where capturing events is the most important thing. When budgets are slashed, some clients can afford to put quality in the back seat as long as the events are current and covered adequately for the intended audience. This is where the user-submitted photos show up and where hacks make their money.\n\nIn genres like fashion and advertising, things work a little differently. Budgets have shrunk here too, but they are still bigger than journalism budgets. More importantly, these genres are all about making a product *look good.* This requires an entirely different skill set and a different approach to photography. As someone who works in fashion, I'd like to argue that fashion and advertising photographers are less threatened by advances in technology or the proliferation of cheap digital cameras than their journalistic colleagues are. \n\n**1. It's more about equipment than we'd like to admit.**\n\nThis is true for fashion to some extent. In many places a Phase One P30+ is the point of entry and $50.000 IQ180 systems are getting more and more common. But at the same time there are celebrated international photographers out there shooting work on a Canon G9 or Contax T2 - cameras that you can buy for well under $300 on eBay. Even if you want a 'serious' camera system you can buy a 5DmkII or D700 with two small primes for less than $2500. That's the sort of money even a student can scrape together with a summer job and a modicum of dedication. Once you put a portfolio together with that, you can start renting Phase One or Hasselblad systems for your more serious gigs. Equipment still matters in fashion, but I'd say the playing field is about as level as one could wish for. \n\n**2. People are doing some unethical shit with RAW and nobody really understands or cares.**\n\nThe ethical side of this is of course a complete non-issue in fashion and advertising. But what is important is that you do have to have a really good handle on the postproduction side to make it in these industries. Not only do you have to be technically very well advanced in all the software, you also have to have the right taste in post and know which direction to take your photography in after you've shot it. I've seen many decent photographers let down by mediocre post. I've also seen exactly how much help successful photographers get from their postproduction artists. \n\n**3. Many times, sadly, it doesn't even matter if your photos are all that good or not.**\n\nIn fashion, how good your photos are matters a LOT. But how good your photos are depends to a very large extent on the stylists, models, hair and make-up artists and locations you get to work with. And this in turn depends on your previous work and on who you know. It's certainly not true that an inexperienced photographer would do as well as a high-level pro if they were put in put in the same situation with the same models etc. But it is true that it is *much* harder for a beginner to make anything half decent when they don't have access to anyone good to work with, especially if they're aiming for the 'high-fashion' side of things. \n\nApart from that, the 'quality' of photos is sometimes hard to measure in fashion. It's all about style and attitude, so in some cases a grainy, out of focus snapshot can be just the ticket for a big-name fashion campaign. In any case, making 'good' fashion photographs is exceedingly difficult. You have to understand the business and know how to deliver what it wants to see. You also have to compete with millions of others for the same handful of jobs. If you're successful it can be a fantastic job, but getting there is about as hard as becoming a rock star. \n\n**4. Photography is easier than we'd like to admit.**\n\nI don't think this is true in fashion. Sure, every year there is a new 18 year old girl with a Digital Rebel who shoots blurry, blown out pictures of her pretty 18 year old girlfriends in the style of The Virgin Suicides with their tops off and gets noticed by a few magazines. But by and large, becoming a fashion photographer is difficult. It's hard to develop a recognizable style that sits well with brands and magazines. It's hard to find the right people to work with. It's hard to shoot something really good, and it's hard to get noticed in the sea of other contestants. There are a few overnight successes, but for most people it takes 5-10 years of very dedicated hard work to get anywhere at all. \n\n**5. We need to stop being goddamn snobs and accept the coming of The Golden Age**\n\nI don't know about other people, but I'm there. The fact that you can get a decent camera for under two grand is fantastic. All your post can be done on a $3k computer including the price of software. It is all fucking amazing. \n\nBut digital medium format is still expensive. So if you're in the part of the fashion business where sheer technical quality is an important distinguishing factor, owning an IQ180 will still give you an edge over the spotty up-and-comers.

I've seen people who know nothing about photography pick up a camera and in months be cranking out work that I was envious of.  This is NOT because photography is easy, it's because those people were geniuses.  You might be one of those geniuses, but most people are not.

We need to stop being goddamn snobs and accept the coming of The Golden Age\n\nYes, yes, this!  Though I think your earlier rants about post processing may be an indicator that you haven't really wrapped your arms around The Golden Age as hard as you think you have.  Cameras are changing at a pace now that it's hard to tell where they will end up.  Today's photography may not even be relevant in 20 years -- perhaps the world will have moved on to lightfield photography, or perhaps everything will be video (if paper dies and everything moves to e-ink or flexible LED, why stick with still images only?).  But the fact that we have cameras today that can shoot decent images at 128,000 ISO on lenses with floating elements that eliminate 4 stops of shake using re-usable digital film that can hold thousands of photos at a time that can all be altered without chemicals and can be sent anywhere in the world in seconds... is magic.  Embrace it!"}, {"comment_id": "c3khup6", "post_id": "ovy78", "comment": "Former commercial photog here (very briefly - I am all better now :).  Comments:\n\n- Pro photography is to art what house painting is to the Mona Lisa.  It is interesting, and frequently very necessary, work, but it's not about being \"creative\".  it's about doing what the customer wants at a price they're willing to pay - just like any other profession.  If you want to be creative, don't become any sort of professional artist.  Do it as a hobby.\n\n- It's not about equipment and it never was.  It's about marketing perception.  In the film days, the photographer walking into a wedding with a MF camera - ANY MF camera ('Blad, Mamiya, etc.) was thought of as a \"better\" photographer than the one walking in with a 35mm.  Why?  Because: a) It was BIGGER and b) Anyone could buy a 35mm.  A 35mm said, \"I'm an amateur just like you\".  This had nothing to do with the reality of how well or poorly the equipment served the task, it was all about \nthe customer perception.  \n\n- If the kid with the D3 is beating you for work consistently, you're not all that good or there is a HUGE difference in equipment.   Musicians have tried to make this argument for years - if I just had the right sound effect/pedal/amp/studio, I'd be a huge success.  It's a crap argument.   They're just making uninteresting music.  The same applies here.\n\n- Quality is mostly less important than turnover.  Digital is objectively less good than film (less dynamic range, more diffractive effects, etc.) but it  doesn't matter.  The difference isn't huge and it's getting smaller every year.  The ability to turn around an image in nearly real time way overshadows the incremental benefits of film (but I still shoot film only because I like the quality and don't have to make a living doing so).\n\n- The quality of consumer cameras coupled with good editing tools is making photographers obsolete for many traditional professional niches like weddings, portraits, and the like.  Couple that with the mall high volume photo \"studios\" and it's pretty much true that this kind of commercial work will vanish for almost anyone other than the aforementioned volume players.\n\n- PJs don't get paid for the picture.  They get paid for *getting to the picture*.  This won't change, but there never was a huge demand for PJs and there never will be.  \n\n- Photo school is mostly as waste of money.  Spend it on equipment, travel, and shooting.  While there are things to be learned in school, there aren't enough of them to justify the insane price of tuition.\n\n- Ansel Adams' classic triology (The Camera, The Negative, The Print) are STILL relevant in the digital age.  The specifics of how things get done are dated and oriented to film/paper, but the larger themes of exposure control, composition, and presentation are timeless.  These books will teach you more about photography than 6 semesters of some self-anointed \"art\" school.\n\n- Read Orland's \"Art And Fear\".  It's flatly the best book on the creative process I've ever seen.\n\n-  In my case, I found out early that I loved photography but hated the business of photography.  I found something else to do for a living that I love and that pays well.  That has allowed me to be a serious photog doing what I love just for me, for over 40 years.

Found it in /r/depthhub\n\nYou claim that (a) amateur pics are of low quality compared to professionals, (b) that great technology is getting cheaper, and (c) photography isn't hard to learn.  Sounds to me that the future of amateur photography is great pictures, probably with composition heavily augmented by software and other features.  \n\nYou claim that (d) nobody cares about documenting the world, but (e) \"user submitted photo is becoming the number one photo credit.\"  Nobody can deny human beings are documenting more, not less.  I think your lament is about the aesthetic capture, its meaning as a distinct art form, its relation to art history, the challenge of composition, waiting for the right moment, its challenging techniques. now unnecessary with focus assist and all the rest.  But then the heros of silver alumn prints would have said the same thing.  They were right, and you are right, and both of course _wrong_.  The end of the amateur era ushered in new eras of photography and of the image.  Likewise the end of the professional era is ushering in something else.\n\nI think there has never been more opportunities to make better pictures.  Even cell phone cameras are surprisingly good compared with a few years ago.  But photographs will never capture the public imagination again, like they did when newspapers and magazines ruled the land, before video existed and it was prohibitive to shuttle film canisters between the continents.  Photographs have become as boring as the everyday moments they intend to document, and only take on a supplementary existence when they accidentally record something _surprising_.  And this image, as you have observed, has almost zero aesthetic requirements.  \n\nThe future will be strange, a completely documented world.  Everything and more all piled up, sorted by machines, linked to maps, stored in the cloud.  Photo albums will cease to exist, for the reasons you mention.  There won't be enough productive space to justify the existence of a paid professional.

I appreciate a good photo and good technical equipment for what it is.  Your post coincides what with what I felt was going on in the pro photo industry.\n\nWhen I was looking at portfolios to hire a wedding photographer, it really became clear to me what a huge range there was not just in terms of the quality of the final output, but also in the style.  I wouldn't have thought that, after all, as a bit of a gear head, I *know* how awesome the top line of cameras can be and what a leg up that is.  But after seeing so many, you sort of start getting an eye for cliche shots, poor composition, too much post-processing, and/or bad focus.  So definitely I feel that photography is still very much an art.  Similar to what you said, I believe you *can* learn photography relatively quickly, but it is exceedingly hard to master.  And heck, it seems like a lot of it comes down to psychology too...you have to know what people will like because ultimately a person (the client) consumes your product.\n\nI think the final thing I'd add is that the accessibility of top end DSLRs has really made, or rather, provided the illusion, that anyone can be a pro.  No doubt, it is night and day the image quality difference between a point-and-shoot and even a low-end DSLR.  I've definitely seen friends who were not that thrilled with their pro wedding photographer but were very happy with the shots that friends snapped with their own gear.  And to be honest, sometimes yeah, you get some friends who really do know what they're doing and you get some great photos.  But I do feel that getting a good pro who knows what they're doing is worth the money and also the peace of mind.

It's a whole other ball game when you're dealing with high-end product shots, or on-location shoots where you need to creatively light huge indoor spaces - managing assistants, art directors, make-up artists, models, props, and all the while keeping clients happy and keeping an eye on things like where the sun is heading in the sky and where the weather is heading.\n\nWhat I've seen some photographers do takes decades of experience to get down. You may be able to get a fairly similar shot given that you know how to use all the lighting equipment, pose models, understand the fundamentals of studio lighting and composition, etc, but you're going to take so long on one shot that you'll never get a job again.\n\nI won't disagree that the type of photographers I'm describing aren't nearly in as much demand as they were 20 years ago, but there will be a need for that sort of thing for the foreseeable future, and amateurs will never be able to pull it off.

For fine arts photographers, increasingly awesome IQ is a boon. They have a completely different market, with completely different considerations. I have friends who work in several  markets, and their businesses have neither dried up nor been invaded by swarms of soccer moms toting fancy gear. These are people who know how to light, build sets, present and display products, and get creative with materials to get a particular look. One of my friends is primarily a jewelry photographer, but also shoots the work of other artists who make clothes, food, and he does some high-end architectural shooting. He has all the work he can handle. My girlfriend (who was a commercial studio photographer for ~12 years,) and I (I just make my art,) both get asked to do all sorts of work, most of which we turn down.\n\nSo... I hear what you're saying about photojournalism, but there *are* other markets. Yes, I would agree that making good images isn't wizardry. The hardest parts to learn to do effectively are lighting and composition, not using the gear and proper exposure.\n\nSometimes shooting something is very, very easy. Sometimes it's easy because we've done it many times before, and know exactly what to do. Sometimes it can be incredibly fucking hard. I struggled for a looong time trying to get good interior shots of a house with some very fancy gear. My gf came in with a Nikon FE2, and using only ambient light (which was tough in this situation,) did an *incredible* job in under a day, shooting only a single roll of film. I know a LOT more about the technical aspects of photography than she does, but she spent almost 20 years in a studio and on locations lighting and shooting with an 8x10. I can fairly easily communicate to her what I know about technical stuff (not that she cares to hear any of it,) but she cannot easily communicate to me what she does with shape, form, color, and light.\n\nSo.

There are people who want to document the moments of that day, but do not care if the shots are artistic or perfect, they do not care if there is a beautiful bokeh in the shot giving a wonderful sense of life or movement. They just want pictures, and lots of them. The other side of this is the people that want that beautiful artistic compilation. Basically one artists talent used to document the wedding with as much emotion as was felt by those involved. To me these are the two sides, with various degrees of grey in between. \n\nWhat will happen is the casual photographer will always charge a few hundred dollars to show up and spray'n'pray your wedding. The people that pay for this service are happy with the documentation and that is all. The other group, the ones who want beauty and perfection, and expression, will start paying more. No matter how much technology advances, there will always be a consumer class and professional class of cameras. This means in 20 years you can have the guy shoot your wedding with a single 100 megapixel Canon with 1,280,000 ISO for $500 or you can have the pro use his fleet of 5000 megapixel Canons with 6,000,000,000 iso, with 14 different lenses, 5 flashes, 4 softboxes, and a partridge in a pear tree. The bridezilla who demands the best will pay more for it, especially if less people become professionals. If this move towards casual-pro photogs means fewer true-pros then the true-pros will eventually have a monopoly on their hands.\n\nAnother thing to note, is that maybe in some fields of photography could someone learn how to use a camera in a few short months. But it takes way more than that to become a true photographer. Photography is an art not a science. It also involves and understanding and ability to control light. An amazing wedding photographer will use a series of soft boxes and reflectors to create the perfect moment. Where as a casual one will take a picture with his device. Perhaps as an editorial photographer you can break it down to the science and get nice looking pictures. I am a concert photographer, and have been for about 3 years. I still am just a guppy in a big pond. I am learning every day, and getting better with every click. Like many people have said on here, if you are just about the money then you sir are not doing it for the right reasons. I make no money shooting concerts, but I do get free access to close to 100 shows a year, I do get to capture moments that could very well be important pieces of music history. \n\nIn regards to people editing there photos and then submitting them on assignments for papers, magazines and other media outlets. This is not new, it is just slipping through the cracks more often, as the industry slowly cuts itself back to an appropriate size. As long as people are not using Photoshop to add or subtract from the originals, then it all falls into the realm of art. There are those who believe a true photographer does not need to edit in Lightroom or Photoshop to bring out the beautiful hues or darken up those blacks. That is an archaic way of thinking. People are shooting without having to worry about those things, they are worrying about focus and composition more and getting even greater shots. Then spending a little time later to enrich the originals. I myself shoot very flat pictures with the expectation of saturating them later on. It all comes down to the business they are going to, and if that business accepts these practices. By no means is it wrong or even taboo, it is just two different approaches. Those who stay with the it-has-to-be-done-all-with-the-camera way tend to be older people, while the shoot-now-finesse-later tends to be the younger crowd. I am more impressed by someone who can shoot amazing rich shots without computer enhancement. It is a sign of talent and experience. But this does not make it more right then doing it the other way.\n\nAnyways I think this is a very good topic and I am sure many people will rip me apart on some of my points. This is just one humble photogs opinion. Cheers.\n"}, {"comment_id": "c3kn1n4", "post_id": "ovy78", "comment": "As a student filmmaker who struggles with crappy equipment I can not wait.

Maybe I just need to rant. For all I know, no one is even going to read this. But here it goes....\n\nI recently graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, one of the worlds most prestigious and america's most influential art school. I studied photography there. I love my camera more than I love my car. However, as a recent grad, totally independent for the first time, I cannot find a job in my field. Not because I have a shitty portfolio or cant make connections, but because I need to pay the bills. I actually dont think I'm making rent this month for the first time because the shit job I've had is at a failing local business and my hours have been cut. I need a job to survive, its near impossible for me to make money doing what I love. \n\nNo one picks up a recent grad. No one. I'd have to assist or intern with horrible hours and or inadequate pay. Honestly, I'd have no problem with being the studio underling, but I need to make my bills. I cant afford to be the grunt I want to be in order to take steps in a career direction. When I cant work under someone, how am I supposed to build a portfolio? Who will let me shoot a wedding with them so I can learn the trade and have shots to show for it? \n\nThe most 'work' I've gotten is to document a room for a friend (which I did for free) and document another friend's ceramic work for her portfolio. I dont want to go to grad school for photo, just to have them teach me what I'd learn better as an assistant.  EDIT: meaning a lot of people are going to grad school right now to avoid how bad the job market is.\n\nIm terrified I wont ever make it into my field. The field I am in a ridiculous amount of debt for. Its heartbreaking. I realize this post became a rant, and I apologize for that, but I feel like a failure even though if I was chasing my dreams any harder I wouldnt be able to eat. \n\nYou know, today I was supposed to do a photoshoot for my current piece of shit job. I was so excited to actually do what I loved for my store and feel like I really *wanted* to be a part of it for once...and then my boss almost canceled it, then ruined my day, and then rushed me through it. Only about half of the shots we needed are good. Now I'll have produced sub par work. \n\nThere is no winning at the bottom of the photofoodchain. I just pray I wont end up a total failure. I try not to be cynical or bitter, its just a little hard lately. This post brought a tear to my eye. And on top of all of this I still need a new/second job. Ay yi yi....\n\n\n\n**TLDR** I ranted about how its so hard to work your way up in the photo industry nowadays, and how I hate myself for not pushing harder into it because I have bills to pay first.

D3 and all the fast lens I want and the camera before that was a D2H.\nThe thing is when i started shooting i was still learning, had a brand new wow camera a really good pay and as i said i really wanted to work as a pj. I still had it in me to make what I got me into photography and at that time it wasn't about the pay it was about the great photos i managed to take.\nfast forward a couple of years. I've switched a couple of newspapers, one of it was a sports newspaper and worked for it for 2 years and I even manage to become a stringer. I got a better offer and went to a normal newspaper. I had a really hard time to find my creativity back. The enthusiasm i had was gone. the more i worked as a pro the less creativity i had. sure i had more experience, I've improved a lot but I started to hate my camera. I even stopped shooting after work hours and workdays. Stop shooting the gf, my dog, nephews... So now I'm jealous and filled with envy from a couple of amateur friends of mine. Jealous of what they produced and creativity they had.\nSo yeah, being a pro it's like working in a chocolate factory and we all know that the workers there don't eat chocolate.\n\nSometimes we forget that we shoot complex photos, photos that only other photographers get. I had an exhibition 2 years ago. I was sneaking behind people i didn't know and overheard them what they said. Also I saw what photo people loved the most. And it wasn't the one that was technically superb, or the one with the best composition. no, they loved the most simple photos. They didn't even get the complex ones. Same thing happens when i sent photos to competitions. I shoot much simpler photos for competitions and when i work on the side. this is why people like FB wedding photos. Plus people are not bothered that the photo has no composition, no focus. we tend to forget those things.\nNo body seem to mention the stock agencies. They killed a lot of side jobs that we had 4-5 years ago. the jobs that had a really nice paycheck. But i never could get why i don't want to shoot stock. probably 'cause i dont have my boss telling me to do so.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "c3ky081", "post_id": "ovy78", "comment": "I think that this applies a lot more to photojournalism than commercial/advertising aspects of photography, but pretty bang on."}, {"comment_id": "c3ky8q7", "post_id": "ovy78", "comment": "I completely understand your frustration - and I'm not even in the field yet.

But you are also looking at a very specific idea of photography, which I think is a big problem. \n\nYea there are people using the hell out of HDR, and guess what, no one in the photo world pays attention. Those types of photographers have ALWAYS been around. Shit half of reddit's /r/photography section is just a bunch of HDR photos of mountains, very little in the way of fine-art or even real commercial photography. It is true that it is getting easier, and of course the more money you have the better gear you can buy, but you are forgetting the huge resurgence of the use of film and alternative processes in the past decade. People are finding that digital is boring, you press a button, it all looks the same. Film and older processes give more room for chance, and dare I say fun! We all know photography is on the outs in terms of how people think and view paying for it. The thought being \"Why would I pay someone who has an eye and REALLY understands the tech side of things when I can just buy a DSLR with some shitty zoom lens on it and do it myself.\" I see it all the time and trust me, it isn't pretty. It isn't \"that hard\" to learn photography, but that doesn't mean that naturally knowing how the world flattens out in a camera is hard. It's a challenge every time I pick up the camera, but the difference between me and every other person with a DSLR is the 8 years of shooting, reading, researching, trying new things, learning new techniques, unlearning those techniques, studying with masters, studying with terrible photographers; all to learn how to make the best images possible. So just like a lot of jobs aren't \"hard\" that doesn't mean you can be awesome by just picking up an expensive camera. Your example of sports photography is null. No one who is a real professional is shooting sports for a news paper regularly, there is no money in it. Those are your suburban hobbyists and if you argue otherwise you are lying to yourself. No ones dream is to shoot high school/college sports of 100 dollars a day. \n\nI could go on all day about this shit but do I agree with you on a lot of points, yes. But natural ability and years of training is still useful and you can always tell the difference between someone who is trying to be a photographer, and someone who just is.

Furthermore, I run into these kind of rants quite frequently these days and it's usually by the photographers who are incapable of being successful in this industry.\n\nTo offer a slight response/rebuttal:\n\n1: I happen to agree with this issue. Equipment absolutely plays a major factor in quality. Many argue that a skilled photographer can get a great shot even with a lousy camera and there is some truth to that, however cheaper cameras have physical and technological issues that often times can withhold creativity or the ability to get a particular shot in a quality manner. \n\n2: This is where I start to disagree. You are certainly able to do some cool things when shooting in Camera RAW, but it is nothing more than what you can do when you creatively process film. Newer photographers often forget about this fact and people have been manipulating exposure, dynamic ranges of color, and other such things for decades before the first commercial digital camera was ever on the market. As for over-use of Photoshop, that's an entirely different issue all together and I think you are confusing manipulation of an image for editorial use with editing it for creative purposes. BIG difference.\n\n3: There is an element of truth to this point, that many people haven't got a clue of a great photo when they see it, much of this mentality is manufactured by the camera companies themselves. Every time Nikon issues a new Coolpix for $200 they want you (and Ashton Kutcher) can take a photo as good as my D700 and anyone who thinks that's the case is sadly mistaken. This has perpetuated the belief that even for a few bucks invested in a DSLR you can be a professional photographer. People often forget that just because you have a good camera it doesn't make you a photographer, it just means you own a camera. The rants I see from photographers on this topic though usually stem from frustration in their inability to get bookings when they see people with less skill and experience than they do getting booked all the time. Since the dawn of photography, or any other creative skill that is sold, it is often times not the best person for the job who gets the job, it's the best marketer of their business who does. Photographers often forget this. Not to say that striving to be a better photographer is an unrewarded effort, it is just that success is never determined by who is the best at something, it's determined by who is the best at SELLING something. While I do consider myself a better-than-average photographer for sure, it is my marketing and sales prowess that has made me successful, not just in my ability to hold a camera. In addition, if you are complaining because  your business is failing because other photographers are charging $500 for a full wedding shoot on Craigslist, you need to get it into your head that the customer who is buying that was never your customer to begin with. At least, they certainly weren't mine, I can't speak for you. If you're having a big issue with this reality, it's time to get over it or go get a job elsewhere.\n\n4: Again, I have to respectfully disagree here. Photography is easy, GOOD photography is certainly not. If you think that anyone can learn to be a great photographer in a matter of weeks you're clueless. While you make the claim that anyone can be of YOUR skill level in a matter of weeks may be true, that says a lot for your level of talent and it's not very good. Malcolm Gladwell's study on the achievements of success people has determined to have a mastery on any subject you need a committed 10 years or 10,000 of actual application. That's not 10,000 hours of claiming to be a photographer, that's 10,000 HOURS OF SHOOTING. That's a far cry from a few weeks as you are suggesting. Again, I think this may be attributed to the fact that you work may not really be as good as you think it is.\n\nAs for the rest of the article, it's just pointless whining that isn't worthy of even responding to. So while I think you make a few interesting points, to me this whole article is nothing more than a whiny rant from an out-of-work photographer shaking his fist at the world for not being \"fair\".

I did a bunch of second-shooter wedding work a couple years ago shooting a D700, f/2.8 zooms, and SB-900. The pure fucking magic about this combo is not having to use off-camera lighting for anything but formals with the entire family.\n\nThe technique is all described [here](http://neilvn.com/tangents/flash-photography-techniques/) and involves bouncing the on-camera speedlight off a convenient surface to turn that surface into a giant softbox. You then mask any direct light from your speedlight so your subject is illuminated 100% with the bounce. You shoot in manual exposure mode to expose the background and then let the camera's TTL metering set the flash power to expose the subjects.\n\nWhy is this pure fucking magic? Because it requires a camera that will deliver solid images at ISO 1600\u20133200 and automagically balance the available-light background with the flash-lit subject. The high ISO is needed due to the light loss from bouncing the light, shooting through a gel to match color temperature, and needing to expose the background enough that the photos don't look like they were taken in a cave. A D700 will do that. A D300 or 60D won't.\n\nShooting a lesser camera requires setting up off-camera lighting or having an assistant follow you around with a giant softbox.\n\nI don't agree regarding the value of used digital cameras. The D3 was released in late 2007 and fetches about $2.5k used. This is because it's good enough. The D3 changed how photographers worked and became the must-have camera. The D4: not so much.

You're gonna have to bee willing to spend way to much money only to get a little back. The canon is a tricky business to get into. I am about to graduate this year with my BFA and someone I am graduating with is basically being sought out by galleries and school to show her work and start their MFA programs. It's not like this doesn't happen, but it's not common. That kind of thing is not going to be taken away by the common consumer who buys a dlsr and a couple of expensive lenses who takes pictures at weddings.

But that wasn't your point and I won't go on about it.\n\nWhen I got my 7D and a couple of speedlites I noticed just how much better my shots became.  When I did my first couple of weddings I noticed how much I grew.  Opportunity is the name of the game just like in so many things in life and it's not fair.  Some kid from the ghettos could do what any of us do given the same resources and possibly better.  We're just lucky.\n\nI'm developing a business around the idea that people aren't looking for the same things in wedding photography that they've looked for in the past.  They're willing to accept the idea that one shooter, possibly with one assistant, might miss some shots, but will take a lot of pressure off of their day and do a much better job than Uncle Bob's Camera Service.  I have to accept that digital reproduction is what it is. I don't have to buy tons of film and process it, but in trade my clients can make all the copies they want with impunity.  I have to sell what people will buy - the economy is not great and a lot of people are getting married that don't have mommy and daddy to pay for a huge wedding.  The albums may have to wait.  Weddings get booked on shorter notice and for less money, so I cut costs where I can.  Believe it or not you can get good results without a 300mm f/2.8 in your arsenal - the longest/widest lens I've used is a 70-200 f/2.8 with a 1.4x extender.\n\nAnd people won't complain about the quality anywhere near like some people think.  As you said, camera phones get published all the time in the press.  While less and less people are resorting to putting disposable cameras on the tables at weddings, getting the shot is far more important - hence the 7D for me and not a 5DII.  Whatever happened to f/8 and be there?  When you're seldom printing any larger than 8x10 you can get away with an awful lot of crap.\n\nBut you can't get away with being a jerk.  You can't get away with being late, with not having showered, with not following through on your commitments.  You can't get away with doing bad business.

But for photography as art, you don't need expensive gear.\n\n2. I would agree for photojournalism this is a big deal.  For casual shooting not so much.\n\n3. It helps if your photos are good and capture emotion/what people want, though.  Technically good photos that don't show anything interesting are not as good as what people find interesting shot at perhaps not the best technical level.\n\nI was fortunate enough to be able to shoot some photos at a recent friend's wedding and they were very appreciative of the photos since the official photographer they got didn't produce photos they were happy with, and guest photos were the typical garbage of low light noisefests or direct flashed black background garbage.  Taken with compacts. Arg.\n\n4. I would dispute this since photography is like a lot of things: it's easy for some people and hard for others.

Where do you have to be to get those shots? How do you it while preserving the moment? How much co-ordination is required with the participants and subjects?\n\nThe more you do it for any specific venue, the easier it gets for that venue.\n\nGiven the ubiquity of phones, a lot more people will get at least one amazing shot in their lives. Sure, a lot of people will get good at it, but they'll also appreciate the difficulties, and be _more_ likely to pay to avoid those difficulties and be part of the party.\n\nThere will always be opportunities for people who can offer some assurance that they will get one amazing shot that night/event/whatev, especially if it is saving someone else effort. The off-road club interrupted their normal flow long enough for me to catch up with the first truck, so they'd all have pictures of their trucks doing crazy stuff. \n\nEvery one of them had a passenger, and every passenger had a camera of some sort.

I admit, I had thought I was going to read some kind of whiny rant that was rubbish, but I totally agree with you about points 1 through 4. FYI, I am not a professional photographer, but I do make my living from a related form of commercial art. My industry utilizes yours often, and also experiences the stuff you talk about in points 1 through 4.\n\nThe part where I disagree is part 5, which is the ultimate conclusion of your post. I don't agree that it's doom and gloom, and that the Unwashed Masses will somehow replace professional commercial photography as a whole. \n\nParts of it may be obsoleted, such as wedding photos. Other disciplines within commercial photography are not going away, such as product photography. We have very real data, accumulated over years, across many industries that essentially says, \"Shiny purty product sells more than blurry iphone picture of product\" ... that's a bit of data that speaks to human factors and motivational techniques. Our brains are hardwired to like bright, shiny pictures of products more than crappy ones. That ain't changing. \n\nSo, when I hear other net nerds whining that stuff like Wordpress is eroding their business, I tend to think that they're not very good (or are inexperienced). So, stuff like Wordpress (or in your case, prosumer hardware) really only erodes the bottom bracket off the industry. Clients you didn't want are giving business to lower-bracket professionals. You have probably moved on, and thus, should not sweat it. \n\nThe other thing I wanted to address, which you only hinted at, is the \"pollution\" of the creativity pool. I would like to say that I think getting more cameras in the hands of more noobs is an awesome thing for creativity and commercial art in general. Basically, even when technology and equipment were a limiting factor, you still had hacks in the job. These cats knew how to manipulate the tools, but are usually uninspired and have no eye. But, they were well trained and probably could go undetected by non-professionals. Now you can wade through a zillion flickr photos a minute, taking in raw and rough talent from young people in Australia, old guys in japan, etc ... these people express unrefined creativity in a way that us professionals sometimes lose. \n\nAnd it makes us have to evolve, and stay ahead of the game. It's a good thing. You've realized the True Game of your profession. Now move past shock, to acceptance, and then plot your course to dominance.

Only a Joao Silva can take you into war and let you dip your eyeball into the stream of world history.  That's great photography.  Having the tech and the chops is just growing the eyeball; the photographer's job is to then take that eyeball to where the rest of the world dreams they could be.  No wonder then that the arguably most monumental photograph ever taken -- *The Blue Marble* -- was taken not by a photographer, but by an astronaut.\n\nThis analysis I think informs all photography.

Sure they can get great shots at a socker game but they sure as hell can't tell a story.  \n\nOn the note of the raw editing.  First off photography inherently distorts events by only capturing what is inside the frame which is highly subjective to the photographer.  The photograph omits all context when constructing the image.  Thus large amounts of data surrounding an event is never captured.  As such one could say the photograph lies by omission.  Yet our world (especially in the time of film) has appropriated photography as a factual medium (which it can be).  So when digital comes along a crisis occurs. Now people have to come to terms with the fact that the photograph denotes only an image not an event.  What is happening with the heavy processing is here to stay, there is no way of going back.  But you might find solis in the fact that digital photography is not really photography in the classic sense.  It may look like photography, it my smell like photography (although it doesn't at all) but in reality digital photography is a completely separate medium.  Digital has a different message (medium is the message). We just haven't come up with a new name for it yet.

People are only focusing on producing shiny, pretty pictures, where everyone is flawless, instead of making beautiful works of art.  What happened to photographers like Sally Mann, who focused on tone, texture, composition, and other design elements - instead of just trying to make a pretty face. It's artificial, an aesthetic nightmare, and encouraged me to not start a career in photography.   I know the photographers aren't the only ones at fault (they are just trying to please their customers) but I would love to start seeing real art again from photographers.  These Photoshopped pieces of junk are even finding their way into art competitions.  As a former photographer, it's sad and disheartening.  \n\nEdit: I'd like to add that I am not trying to say that shitty, cookie-cutter pictures don't come out of a darkroom (because they do).

Can you elaborate on your concept of \"unethical\" RAW manipulation?  I shoot RAW and regularly adjust the crap out of my levels - color adjustment, shadows/mids/highlights, an occasional tweak to the vibrance.  Now, is this what you're talking about?  Because if I have a beautifully framed image, caught the action at the right time, etc. but I need to push/pull the shadows and highlights, that's not something that strikes me as unethical - no more unethical than making adjustments to the exposure and contrast of film in the darkroom.  Just curious what RAW adjustments are going on that you consider unethical.\n\n2. Does someone having nice equipment inherently make them an asshole?  My dad helped me out with equipment a lot over the years, and I hope that one detail doesn't make me the bane of every other photographer.  I assure you, just because I have an expensive rig does not mean I can shit beautiful photographs every time i go shooting.  There is more to it than that.\n\nThanks for your frank honesty.

So I do am on tour, the press people who go there know the drill, probably either I or my partners make sure the press people know about or even sign the rules of a licensing agreement. Some time later I'm already in a different place in the world setting up the 30th concerts on this tour. Suddenly some guy who hasn't read the rules he signed, or doesn't want to know what he signed, or thinks what he signed should not be allowed, starts sending cease and desist notices to random people without checking if those people are already covered by the initial agreement.\n\nMy merch partner is one of these people. She gets stupid messages on Instagram all the time, so she ignores his message, but the day after the guy sends an e-mail. She's a graphics designer who does an excellent job at making clothes, only reads the words \"I am an attorney\" and \"500 Euros\", doesn't know what to do and goes ballistic. She calls me, I have to calm her down and now it's my problem. Great. I have a f***ing tour to run. I have no idea which of the many different agreements for the many countries we have been to the guy actually signed, so I take a minute of my precious time to let him know that what my merch partner did is usually covered by the agreements, based on the standard text blocks I usually use for these mails.\n\nInstead of getting the hint, checking the initial agreement and just shutting up, the guy sends back a ~300 word e-mail, ignores everything I've written, pretends he never agreed to any rules before coming to the festival with his press pass, lectures me on copyright (which is different in each country and an \"attorney\" should know that!), and affirms his claim. All of this because of an average picture of our singer which my merch partner has most likely used legally and which was liked by a couple hundred people on instagram. And this crap is probably going to repeat the next time this guy shows up. I don't have time for this amateur. I don't ever want to have to deal with him again.\n\n\nWithout wanting to take a side or saying who's right before we know the missing details: I've been on all sides of this argument, either as the official band photographer, merch producer/seller or third-party photographer.

I agree that we should all work in peace and harmony. \n\nWe the fans pay for the shows, the band plays the shows and brings us merch and earns money for themselves the next album and the label. \n\nThe venue earns money from us and gives a place for the event to take place and food and drinks. \n\nThen Photogs get in for free and take photos for free of the band playing the show. Normally that all goes on goodwill by band and venue, to the displeasure of us the fans. Now here mr. Salmeron breaks that good will which raises the question if it should continue to exist at all. \n\nPersonally I would ban photogs altogether and here are my reasons: \n\n1. Money spend and time spend by the band and organizers to bring this show.\n\n2. Copyright law which gives the subject no right over the images distribution. (if they don't sign a release, they can stop it from being used for something that ruins their image)\n\n3. Disrespecting the band and their associates as in this case.\n\n4. Venues sometimes fail to secure Photo rights for the band as Forta Rock did\n\n5. You get in for free and you make money and pay the band with exposure and good vibes (sound familiar?)\n\n6. The ability to act on copyright law as this guy did on a photo of the lead singer wearing the designers one of a kind object on THEIR concert, stage and of THEIR live performance - Having the audacity to tell your model that she has the right to share it, and the paying fans that if they share it he will not press charges.\n\n7. 6 months after he tarnishes the good name of the band and takes advantage of the bands good will to not have him sign a release on his photos\n\n. I doubt we will be seeing much of that by many bands now.\n\nThing is that even if we ban the photo pit, we are still left with the same copyright issue for every fan in the crowd. So since some photographers cannot play nice and are completely disrespectful to the metal scene, I would suggest to grant all of the copyrights to the band permanently from both paying fans and free photographers as standards of business. Without the bands the photos won't exist and I wont have anything to listen to. Now here bands may hire photographers - increase potogs revenue, or pay magazines or the other way around - the one who pays gets the rights. While Fan photos are for personal use only and all of the commercial copyright lies with the band as terms of service for attending accepted by attending with or without a ticket and a photopass or other gateway - you take pics at the venue of the band you grant them the rights.\n\nReason being that the artists do not deserve this abuse, they won't be the first and they won't be the last, we saw the results of this. Notice that the photographer here gives no money to the band but promotes his photography and then has the audacity to demand money from said band. \n\nFor me that is preposterous - why does he get all of the bands work for free by snapping a picture?\n\nWhat is your take on this, how would you solve this issue - I am asking because I am planning on writing to every label and organizer in the world that set the trends to safeguard the artists from what ensued these past few days. Hell that may do nothing but I want their take as well . This was a lot of fun to read, to write and to argue and to read all of the comments but it was at the bands expense and at the clothing business's downfall for which no one has paid anything to or has effectively destroyed a human being over peanut money. - memes, comments, exposure entertainment all for free and ruining their holidays as well at the time when you should be with your family and be happy. Released when most people would read good tactic, but the eye of Streisand has been known to bring permanent change.\n\n&#x200B;"}, {"comment_id": "ecn3a23", "post_id": "a9s7l4", "comment": "Holy crap that was a lot of reading"}, {"comment_id": "ecmlerw", "post_id": "a9s7l4", "comment": "Is it just me, or has PetaPixel gone from interesting to mediocre to terrible?"}, {"comment_id": "dunjnkc", "post_id": "7zf81u", "comment": "I just don\u2019t get why social media has decided showing posts chronologically is the worst thing ever.

Photography for some is more of a popularity contest to see who can garner the most likes and further bolster their popularity while for others who have a general love and appreciation for Photography tend not to gain nearly half as much praise/attention which they deserve. I've seen plenty of times where highly skilled photographers with amazing talent/skill get very little to no attention against someone who is taking a picture of their spaghetti hoops which gains thousands of likes. It's also worth bearing that there are a lot of \"bot\" programs that will generate \"likes\" for you on various platforms which somewhat negate the entire concept of social media for me.\n\nMy answer would be simple - a social media platform for dedicated photographers who are serious about further learning/development of their skills or love of Photography regardless of experience.

It's a job that offers a lot of power and the ability to do horrible violence to other people.  That sometimes attracts people to the job that should be the last people on earth you'd want doing that job.  However, America hasn't found a good way to weed those people out.  \n\nThere's a hero worshiping complex in this country where people love to worship people just for the uniforms they put on and believe they are incapable of doing wrong.  If they're on a jury and it's the word of a cop against the word of someone they supposedly beat up, they might believe of the cop just because he's a cop.  I think that's becoming less and less common, but the hero worshipers are still out there.  \n\nIn the end though, money talks.  I think the main cause of this lack of accountability is that that the money for police is taken by force through taxes, criminal fines, or seizure of property.  They get paid if they do a good job, or bad job.  There's no way for Americans to boycott the police.  I don't expect any of this to change until people change the way police are funded.  We have volunteer fire departments, so why not volunteer police departments?  If they're providing a good service to the public, then the public shouldn't have any reason not to give them money.  If they start beating up homeless people, or harassing people for stupid little things, then people should refuse to pay until something is done to fix the problem.  Right now, if there's a problem with your local cops, there's little your community can do to hurt them financially so they'll stay in line.  \n\nSheriffs do get voted on, but voting is a really bad way to weed out bad people and takes to long to change things.  Most people forget important things when voting comes around anyway, or don't put that much thought into voting for a sheriff.  There are some sheriffs and chiefs who do the right thing and do look out for the civilians, but there's also a lot who will stick up for other cops way before ordinary citizens, even when they're obviously wrong.  They see themselves as a higher class.  You can give cops more cameras, but I think it would cost less and be more effective if people's right to photograph police were more secure, more people were encouraged to do it, and it was something cops knew was part of their job to put up with.  Of course Kelly Thomas' murder was caught on camera and it didn't do jack squat to convict his killers.  \n\n**TL;DR: Make police departments voluntarily funded so their communities can boycott them if they do wrong and they can actually be held accountable**"}, {"comment_id": "cf7d82d", "post_id": "1wzngj", "comment": "Thanks for posting this, I had to write a paper about journalism and the first amendment, so I decided to write about your story.

Problem is there are a lot of things in photography that are not intuitive: (examples gratis: f/1.4 is a larger aperture than f/5.6, blue is a hotter color temperature than yellow, the rule of thirds is not a rule, a 35mm lens designed for a crop sensor and a 35mm lens designed for full frame will look exactly the same when used on a crop sensor, stopping down makes an image sharper... until it doesn't... because of quantum physics, rules for photographing in public vary by the country you're in)\n\nPhotography draws a lot of different types of people, but the overlapping segment of those that also are drawn to reddit tend to have some common personality flaws: desire to be \"right\" or prove their knowledge, relatively technically minded but want to be a little creative (but \"modern art\" level creative is often looked down upon).\n\nAnd another issue is the mods aren't paid so you get who shows up to mod.

I mention this as demographic information to keep in mind, because you're getting a very specific viewpoint over and over. I happen to fit into these categories, so when I ask things, or go into something expecting a discussion coming from varying viewpoints, I have to remind myself that, most of the people I'm reading _from_ are basically me. I'm hearing from a lot more me's. **So it may not be a representative or diverse sample of viewpoints I'm hearing from.** <- that is the only reason I want to bring up demographics.\n- The people coming to a lot of niche or learning based subreddits aren't necessarily masters themselves. I think the vast majority are here also seeking to learn. They just may be at a different stage of learning than you, so they pass on knowledge they've already attained (think of a semi-advanced shooter wanting to learn high level techniques seeing some people ask about basics. They're here to learn and improve, but can easily offer their opinion on the basics). So think of the people here not as teachers, or successful professionals (though lots may actually be). But all learners at different stages. In /r/photography, I think we might have a lack of high level people wanting to help out with those starting at the bottom.\n\nFinally, and this one might strike a nerve, photography in many online communities is really harsh among amateurs. And I think for the same reason that bullies exist: insecurity. Bullies tear people down usually because they feel bad about something in themselves. And they want to bring others down to their feeling of worth so they feel better, that everyone is on the same esteem level. \n\nSimilarly, I think a lot of amateur photographers are insecure about their work. They may not be the first to hop on the \"congratulations what an awesome shot!\" train, because they don't feel like their own work is awesome. If they're handing out kudos to people, they might feel like others are passing right by in skills and quality. So they reserve their praise for only idols they are aspiring to.

Got some new (or new-to-you) gear you want to share? Looking to bounce some ideas off of other people for things you want to try? Post in the most recent Community Discussion thread.\n\nIf you didn't post it in a community discussion thread, then it should be downvoted because that's the rules of the sub.\n\n>Anywho, I know this post will likely get downvoted (surprise)\n\nStating that a post will likely get downvoted is such a shallow way to get sympathy votes, and is a part of what makes a shitpost on any sub across Reddit.\n\nYour whole post is a shitpost that lacks any substantive information to back up what you say.

Photography is very much a love/hate relationship for me.  I\u2019ve commented on internet things here and there genuinely trying to share my knowledge, but about 40% of the time I get some angry response from some lonely person who cares enough to argue about shut that doesn\u2019t matter.

You *can* ask questions here but only in the dedicated questions threads. You can break those rules and be upset that people aren't as helpful as you want them to be, or you can go to the places where questions are welcomed. It's your choice. \n\n2) It's rare to find anybody happy about your excitement about any of your own accomplishments and achievements\n\nYeah sorry, this sub is not your personal cheerleading squad. That's not because we aren't happy for you, it's because this sub has 1 million subscribers. We can't all have the spotlight every time we do something. As a compromise, there is the community thread where you are free to share your excitement and you will generally get a response from people who are happy for you. \n\n3) Opinions about preferences can be right and wrong, but most of the time, they're always wrong.\n\nThat's not my experience at all. Sure not everybody is capable of polite and thoughtful debate but that is true everywhere in the world. This place is a helluvalot better than most other places on the internet. \n\nIn my experience, people here sometimes react badly to low-effort posts but they react extremely well posts that show a little bit of effort and considered thought. For instance [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/photography/comments/6c29hf/what_makes_this_photo_great_clint_eastwood_by/) is one of the most popular things I ever wrote. It's entirely my subjective opinion, but nobody told me that my opinion was wrong.

The sheer amount of gigs I worked for months on end, for no pay, is the biggest scam in the history of the arts.  As I've become more interested in photography and started lurking on this and other subreddits I've only noticed this problem growing.  Speaking towards those who blame millennials and them taking cheap or free work, believe me, we're PISSED at this behavior.  Most millenials I know in the arts get sick of it and either leave or do their own thing.  Starting your own film studio, or theatre company, art gallery, or any other method of distribution is extremely difficult, but so is working for \"exposure\", and we prefer being paid for our work.  Only time I give away my photography, even though I'm still firmly in the amateur hobbyist stage, is for causes I'm either involved in, or believe in (with the exception of Lightsaber photography, I like avoiding the whole legal vs illegal quandary when it comes to photographing other people's copyrights [yes Lightsaber photography is a thing.  A very, very cool thing.  Light painting with laser swords]).  Kudos to OP for sticking up for himself and other photographers, and screw anyone who says his response was unprofessional.  He was very civil in the first message, they responded unprofessionally in return [starting a response to appropriating someone else's work with \"seriously?\" is NOT professional], and he has every right to get paid.  Will he? Probably not.  Should he drop it out of the fact it's more stress or hassle than it's worth? Maybe.  But he's stuck up for the rest of us in informing a company that when they use a photo from a professional, they should pay for it, and in making this heard as widely as possible.  I hope the company mans up and pays you.

Here me out on this\n\nI feel like nobody understands exactly the business model you are in. I'll tell you right now, that it is audience aggregation. Building an audience through various platforms such as: Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, etc. \n\nThe larger your audience the more money you will make. This is where us reposter accounts come into play. I share your photo, so the value I get is Free content (Ouch! I know it burns), using my Instagram skills. I increase your reach dramatically with my following. What do you get out of it? Increased audience --> Which means more money. \n\nWhen people share your content for free do you make money right away? Nope. It's long game business. It indirectly increases your money for the future. So if you have a product or something you want to sell, you promoted it to your audience. \n\nI believe you have it all wrong in the sense, that you are trying to monetize content vs. increasing audience to get brand deals, which pay much much better. Featuring a brands product on your Instagram.\n\nGuess what? People contact me all the time get featured because they know that more exposure means more potential money. Whenever I repost without permission, they LOVE it. They thank me.\n\nLegally though, I'm wrong.\n\nEDIT: Instead of getting mad over a measly $25.

"}, {"comment_id": "dp3xwgn", "post_id": "79p3i9", "comment": "Two possible solutions: \n\n1. Make drone operation require a license and basic safety training. All drones must broadcast their identity/owner, like a kind of electronic license plate. This way, if a drone shows up where it isn't supposed to be, it can be identified immediately and the owner can be contacted. If the owner doesn't respond, refuses to comply, or the drone turns out to be unlicensed/not broadcasting, it will be impounded or destroyed, depending on the drone and what it's carrying.\n\n2. Use electronic \"force fields\" to keep drones out of restricted airspace. The \"force fields\" would be coded into the drone's navigation system, so that any time it approached restricted airspace, it would stop and alert the operator. This option may be a little further off though, since I imagine most current drones lack the navigation systems to make this work. If we did get to a point where all drones had this capability and all had to comply with the force fields, any drone caught in restricted airspace would just be impounded or destroyed, as it would imply that the operator had illegally tampered with the coding.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dp4kime", "post_id": "79p3i9", "comment": "well depending on the airspace, as long as you are part 107 licensed and you get clearance from ATC, you\u2019re welcome to fly near the airport."}, {"comment_id": "dp4yyo3", "post_id": "79p3i9", "comment": "God this is fucking bullshit"}, {"comment_id": "dp4kvzt", "post_id": "79p3i9", "comment": "I was considering buying a drone recently but then I started looking at places I'd like to fly it and discovered I would not be able to legally fly at practically any of them.

There is an area near me that is within the exclusion zones of 6 or 7 different airports. Big cities have helicopter landing pads on top of buildings and those technically have 80-square mile exclusion zones around them as well unless you get approval from the helipad operator before flying. And various empty fields are designated as potential emergency landing zones for helicopters or airplanes, so those technically have 80-square mile exclusion zones as well.

So far, there was never a case where drone hit cost anyone a single life. Also, if these things are so dangerous--the detection can't be that hard. Most drones are controlled by transmissions in 2,4 GHz range and typically transmit telemetry and video, which should make them very easy to locate. Commercial drone detection tech already exists, why don't large airports already have it?\n\nAs for \"hunting drones\" -- I find it supremely stupid.

This is done in an iterative approach, each time tweaking numbers to try to dial in a small image that still looks good, using a technique (Butteraugli) that approximates human perception.\n\nRelevant snips:\n\n>The \ufb01rst optimization opportunity we make use of is changing the (global) quantization tables to make the quantization coarser, which decreases the size of the image (by decreasing the magnitude of stored coe\ufb03cients). This is similar to adjusting the quality parameter in a traditional JPEG encoder and causes distortions in the whole image. The second opportunity involves direct modi\ufb01cation of the coe\ufb03cients. We replace some of the DCT coe\ufb03cient values in each block with zeros. This modi\ufb01cation distorts the visual appearance of the block in question. Zeros are RLE-encoded, so encoding a zero that occurs next to another zero costs virtually nothing. Thus, replacing a coe\ufb03cient with a zero, when there is a neighbouring zero, reduces the encoded size by the size of that coe\ufb03cient. Even if there is no neighbouring zero, encoding of a zero is virtually always shorter than of a non-zero value. Lastly, we consider an encoding in YUV420 mode, where two out of three channels are downsampled by 2\u00d72. Unfortunately, YUV420\u2019s handling of an area of the image does not depend on the colors involved, and so it cannot capture e\ufb00ects such as the one in Fig. 2 (see Fig. 5 for the distortion that Guetzli applies to that image, which still cannot be seen). In many cases encoding an image in YUV420 mode, with no quantization, already causes a visible distortion. Thus, YUV420 is rarely useful in the quality range Guetzli targets. \n\n.\n\n>Guetzli uses an iterative optimization process. In order to make the problem simpler, the optimizer is not guided by \ufb01le size. Instead, it is driven by the perceptual quality target alone. It aims to create a JPEG encoding with perceptual distance below a given threshold, as close to the threshold as possible. Each iteration produces a candidate output JPEG and, at the end, the best (not necessarily the last) one of them is selected. \n\n.\n\n>We evaluate the Guetzli compressor and compare its performance at the same psychovisual distortion measured by Butteraugli. Butteraugli is the metric Guetzli optimizes for. Thus, this experiment tests Guetzli\u2019s optimization abilities and, in itself, does not measure visual quality of the results. We will separately publish results of a human rating study that does compare visual quality, as perceived by humans. \n\n.\n\n> Butteraugli takes into account three properties of vision that most JPEG encoders do not make use of. First, due to the overlap of sensitivity spectra of the cones, gamma correction should not be applied to every RGB channel separately. There is some relationship between e.g. amount of yellow light seen and sensitivity to blue light. Thus, changes in blue in the vicinity of yellow can be encoded less precisely (Fig. 2). YUV color spaces are de\ufb01ned as linear transformations of gamma-compressed RGB and thus are not powerful enough to model such phenomena. Second, the human eye has lower spatial resolution in blue than in red and green, and has next to no blue receptors in the high-resolution area of the retina. Thus, high frequency changes in blue can be encoded less precisely. Third, the visibility of \ufb01ne structure in the image depends on the amount of visual activity in the vicinity. Thus, we can encode areas with large amount of visual noise less precisely (see example in Fig. 3). In Guetzli we model all these aspects in a way that leads to homogeneous loss in the image. We achieve this by guiding the encoder with Butteraugli, our psychovisual metric.\n"}, {"comment_id": "df20bww", "post_id": "5zxbuj", "comment": "As a web-designer, it's obvious why they put effort in to this.

The background is in close ratio to the subject, the subject is evenly lit and has a bit of an edge light. The cat just happens to be the subject, and it works well.

I shoot pretty darn good landscapes too. However, you won't see my landscapes anywhere except my personal Facebook feed and printed around my house. \n\nIf I'm a client and I'm thinking about hiring you to shoot my wedding/house/product/portrait/anything that isn't my pet, and I find this random, albeit good, photo of your cat in your portfolio, I'm gonna be a bit turned off and confused. \n\nThere are five scenarios in which this cat pic would be an appropriate addition to your web-or-print-based public-facing portfolio. \n\n1. A blog post where you talk about this cool shot you got of your cat \"just for fun.\"\n\n2. An about/personality page where you share info about yourself and your cat.\n\n3. You are a pet photographer.\n\n4. Your work is intentionally eclectic. If you shoot fine art or even street photography, I'd say this is an appropriate addition. \n\n5. (Please don't do this, I hate when people do this) on a \"personal/just for fun\" section on your gallery site. (I don't think these are usually good or helpful, but I suppose it is OK) \n\nSorry for the long post/lecture, and forgive me if you know all this already. Again, great shot, but keep it away from your professional world unless you have a good reason.

It is the band's effort that has made it a compelling photograph and potentially worth money (if the band becomes popular). In other words,  the interest in the photo is because of the subject matter. So, I don't think it would have been unreasonable to allow the band to use the photo. \n\nI would have emailed the band saying that it looks like they have a poorly cropped and filtered version of the photo and that I'd prefer they use the whole thing with my photo credit. Nothing about payment, because it was the band that created the value that the photo has, not the photographer.\n"}, {"comment_id": "cgxz371", "post_id": "23jxvq", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "cgy2lv6", "post_id": "23jxvq", "comment": "Damn, this could be some JusticePorn."}, {"comment_id": "cgy6xjx", "post_id": "23jxvq", "comment": "Someone get 4chan to make them pay!"}, {"comment_id": "cgy972s", "post_id": "23jxvq", "comment": "So the actual subject of a photo has no IP rights at all in the photo?

Sometimes sacrifices must be made haha.\n\nIf you dont mind me making a small suggestion, I would try using an [abrasion resistant polycarbonate](https://www.mcmaster.com/#glass/=1bsppfl) infront of your lens because its the least likely to scratch or pit from debris. You can get just basic polycarb for like $5 so you could also just buy 10 and use them as disposable parts. It would save you a lot of money in the long run, and polycarb is the least likely to warp your image and if you get the thin stuff (under 0.5\") it will have minimal effect on your light.\n\nAs for dew, you really just need to make sure youre above the dew point. If you have a power source, I would just buy a [heat gun](https://smile.amazon.com/Genesis-GHG1500A-Temperature-Nozzle-Attachments/dp/B00EU2T8GG/ref=sr_1_4?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1520014119&sr=1-4&keywords=heat+gun) and point it at the edge of the poly carbonate, about a foot away. This way air is traveling along the surface of the polycarb and the lens.

I took a 50 caliber ammunition can, cut a hole in one end, and put a pane of acrylic over it. Then, I nestled an 8mm analog camcorder inside. \n\nBut here's the thing - I didn't point it straight up. \n  \nI pointed the opening horizontally, and then set up a guitar stand to hold a 1-foot square mirror pane (available in packs of 12 from your local big box hardware store for under $20) at a 45 degree angle. Instead of burning debris falling on the unprotected camera, pointed lens-up, it fell on a mirror I didn't care about, and mostly slid off, while the camera was protected from damage. \n  \nSo why not protect your camera with sandbags instead of crappy plastic grocery bags, point it at 90 degrees off-axis to the shot you want, and have a cheap, disposable mirror take the damage instead of your lens? Hell, throw a one-shot hand warmer packet behind the mirror that will keep it warm enough to prevent condensation for 8+ hours, too.

If you attach and seal your circular filter appropriately you shouldn\u2019t be getting dew formation between the lens and the inside of the filter (attach it when you\u2019re not in a humid environment?).\n\nAlso strictly speaking, you\u2019re actually going to be reducing the surface area that dew can form on since lenses are typically curved on the outer most element, whereas a filter will be flat. #math\n\nAnd then, if it\u2019s going to be a dewy environment, it\u2019s going to form on the glass regardless of if you have a filter on it or not. In fact, if you get a filter with a special coating, you might even be able to decrease the incidence of dew formation.\n\nRegarding artifacts: Rare. You\u2019ll get them when you\u2019re at strange angles to your light source and/or if it\u2019s a very poor quality uncoated filter. And even if they do show up, it\u2019s trivial to remove such artifacts in post.\n\nFinally cost/quality? A filter with decent coatings will typically be under $100. So you are saving money by not having to buy another $100 lens. Your argument about cost literally makes no sense. A good enough filter will always be cheaper than the lens, so you are still saving money.\n\nSo honestly, you really should have used a UV or general protection filter.\n\ne.g. [Hoya Evo Antistatic UV Filter - 77mm - Dust / Stain / Water Repellent, Low-Profile Filter Frame \u2014 $75](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00M17R1UM/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_y9zMAb47FJ70W)\n\n***That being said, I really like your photos\u2014they are quite cool.***\n\n**Edit:** source regarding filters and dew..

[Source](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-04-19/leica-draws-china-s-ire-with-video-invoking-tiananmen-massacre)\n\nAs a 1st generation Chinese-American (whose grandparents/family fled China in the 30s-40s), a photographer, and former photojournalist (if even just at my university paper for 3 years), I'm disappointed. This was a really powerful video. And so timely as we approach the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. 30 years since that event, that same oppressive regime (and others around the world) continue to censor, imprison, and outright kill its citizens + the journalists who risk their lives everyday to document it all. Leica really did use to be *the* original photojournalists' camera (even if Tank Man was taken on an FE2). Recognizing that legacy, and furthermore the immense impact that photojournalism can potentially have... to stand behind that message - it would've been a meaningful gesture. But they didn't. A bit of a shame.\n\n>For the co-directing duo [of The Hunt], Kid Burro (Stink Films) \u201crare are the films that allow immersion in concept and development like this. We studied, for over a year, several stories of photographers and, mainly, the obstacles they had to overcome to achieve the striking photos of their careers. Without their bravery and boldness, maybe many stories would have never been known around the world\u201d.

Does a larger aperture mean that it can therefore focus on smaller, or greater depth field? (i.e. is it sharper on a greater range of distances or smaller range of distances, with a larger aperture? And if it is smaller, than why do we ever need large apertures? Why not just have all cameras with smaller ones, surely it's better to be able to focus on more?)\n\n\n2. I understand that iSO is the sensitivity of the sensor, but then can some cameras 'handle' higher iSOs without giving too much noise in a shot? (as you said a DSLR is good at up to 6400, compared to a compact camera at 1600) What is is that limits how well a camera can 'handle' a higher a higher iSO setting without giving too much noise?\n\n3. Thirdly, just out of curiosity and getting more informed on the subject, where can I find out information about my specific camera? How is it usually displayed, say, when buying a camera - or even on the camera on my phone?\nIt seems the main thing they want people to care about nowadays is just the number of megapixels!\n\nPhew!

The old rule of thumb is 1/focal length, in 35mm equivalent field of view.\n\nAlso, your take on flash is a bit simplistic, and even a bit misleading. Flash doesn't boost shutter speed; it adds a light source to the photo. The light source it adds is typically flashed for an extremely short duration -- this is where the shutter speed confusion comes in: the flash can function as an artificial shutter. If your aperture and ISO let in very little ambient, you can think of the flash as your only light source. If that only light source is flashed for, say, 1/16000th of a second, you will freeze action even if your shutter speed is, say, 1/100 (as long as your shutter speed doesn't let in too much ambient)."}, {"comment_id": "c1ns4b5", "post_id": "ghlau", "comment": "This is pretty good.

If you allow adjustments made to aperture and ISO, cameras again have a far bigger dynamic range than the human eye. \n\nWhat you're impressed by is the human brain's ability to fool you into thinking you're seeing a huge dynamic range while you're actually not. \n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dkq264d", "post_id": "6pjy5v", "comment": "Shoot Pentax.\n\nBest dynamic range I've ever seen in a body below $5000\n\nUnfortunately AF, noise floor, lens options, video mode, and a whole bunch of other things are shit."}, {"comment_id": "dkq5d8a", "post_id": "6pjy5v", "comment": "I appreciate how camera sensors don't have a slightly off-center spot where there are no pixels."}, {"comment_id": "dkqawxx", "post_id": "6pjy5v", "comment": "Photographer version of r/showerthoughts"}, {"comment_id": "dkq5vgx", "post_id": "6pjy5v", "comment": "https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/picture-this-photography-podcast/id1078466875?mt=2&i=1000367813071\n\nIf anyone is interested this is a really interesting episode of a Podcast I regularly listen to.

I encourage everyone to [read the paper](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab0ec7) if they have time.\n\nSo let's start with the concept here. The main issue with photographing things in space is that you're severely diffraction limited.\n\nI know I could leave it at that, but I want to illustrate what I mean when I say \"severely diffraction limited\" here.\n\nConsidering the black hole is 26,000 lightyears (152,800,000,000,000,000 miles or 246,000,000,000,000,000 km) away, but only about 0.00002 light years big, meaning you need an angle of view of 0.0000000000134 degrees, which on a 35mm camera calls for a focal length of 3,741,328,886,115 mm. Now you knowing the importance of bokeh obviously gets a camera lens at the focal length with an objective lens a football field across (telescopes are only 1/3 this size on the extremes). What's your aperture? F/409,156,702. Like I said, diffraction limited.\n\nScientists found a way around this using \"combined aperture inferometry\". Let's start with the first half of this. Basically the gist is, building a telescope 100m across is borderline impossible. So instead, you can take two 10m telescopes, place them 100m away from each other, and using mathematics, create an image as if it was taken with an aperture of 100m. This comes with two draw backs, however.\n\nFirst, the light collected is much less. A 100m telescope lens collects light from 10,000 m^2 of land. Two 10m telescopes only collects light from 200 m^2 of land. As we go up in size (talking miles) this grows exponentially. This, however, isnt that bad becasuse our astronomical targets are basically stationary, and we can have shutter speeds of years if need be. And the benefit of minimizing our diffraction limited resolution (again severe) heavily outweighs the cost of a longer run time.\n\nSecond, the only way for these telescopes to work is to time their data collection down to the microsecond (0.000001 s). This is a much bigger challenge. The way this is done is by connecting the telescopes via a coax cable that acts as a timer. Now instead of being limited by how big of a mirror you can produce, you're only limited by how far you can run a coax cable without losing timing precision. Now instead of 100m, you can make a telescope with an \"aperture\" (well, sort of) of 1km!\n\nThis was taken to a new extreme using hydrogen masers, which is an ultra high precision timer that works by using hydrogen atoms that produce a very consistent frequency pulse. Basically the scientists would meet, and \"start their watches\" at the same time. Then when they collected data at their respective telescopes, as long as they used the hydrogen maser, they were on the same time and could recombine them at a new date. Now we have gone to telescopes with an \"aperture\" of 1000s of km as in the Atacana desert array.\n\nThe black hole telescope went one step further, and put telescopes around the globe, that took turns collecting data, to create a telescope with an aperture the size of our world. \n\nNow let's talk about the second half, interferometer. I think the best way to do this us to use the scientific words, then break it down. A millimeter wave interferometer collects photons in a temporal space, interprets frequency space.\n\nSo \"temporal space\" just means the data it collects it's time dependent. Contrast this with a normal camera, where whether you collect light at the start or end of of the shutter window doesnt matter. It's similar to take a video on a camera with no lens. They then take this video of noise and infer its frequency space image.\n\nI think the best way to under stand frequency space is with music. Music is a series of pressure fluctuations over time. But you can display it with sheet music, which shows you the frequencies of sound over time. Inferometers are similar in that they aren't showing you the picture, they're showing you what frequencies are in the image. Except instead of the frequencies being pressure over time, it's the intensity of light over the image. Kind of like what you can see [in this image)[https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcTvvc0KVnEHbxPX73-R7povizLiKYX-_uAp2UoO2XqyEMHRvihs].\n\nThis brings us to the last step of the process, converting this frequency space image into a real world image. The math for this is actually settled, and you can use what's called the fourier transform, the specific algorithm is usually the Fast Fourier Transfirm, FFT. Theres a problem, however, in that there a missing pieces.\n\nGoing back to the music example, let's say I gave you sheet music and told you to perform the song, but notes were missing, how do you do it? Well I you know it's a Mozart, you can use trends in his music to fill in the data.\n\nThe scientist further created something novel, by taking an incomplete data set, and using the laws of physics and some mathematics to fill in the gaps and make assumptions that allowed them to complete the inverse FFT to create the final image we all get to see. This is the arduous process they had been going through between completing the data set and publishing the image."}, {"comment_id": "ekjycsv", "post_id": "bbmv65", "comment": "Space is 180p"}, {"comment_id": "ekjvt3e", "post_id": "bbmv65", "comment": "\"enhance\""}, {"comment_id": "ekk1s49", "post_id": "bbmv65", "comment": "Impressive picture, but the post processing took 55 million years.

If possible, it's good to know the police representative as well. There should also be legal observers. They will be wearing matching hats or another identifying mark. They'll tell you how to get their attention. I make sure you're within earshot, and if something like this happens, call them *immediately*. Their job is to record what happens so that if you're just a bystander and get caught in it, they have a legal record for a lawsuit.\n\nIt may be different in DC, but that's what I've learned here in Raleigh (NC).

Do you do something like a camper van road trip or do you just fly, rent a car, and go? Related question, how do you find your locations? Are they mostly accidental that you find from just traveling/hiking around/photo walking locally, or do you find recommendations and then scout the area?\n\nI live in Beijing, and I feel like it's so hard to find local photogenic landscapes. I look at pictures and I just think, \"The places I've been just aren't as pretty as where professional photographers go.\" I think my problem is that when I travel, I'm not adventurous enough to just get in a car and drive. I only have limited time when I travel, so I really only go to places that I know for sure won't be disappointing. I'm very interested in landscape photography, but maybe I just don't have the time to invest in it.

You SHOULD be, if you've never used them before. I use them on most of the images that I process, and they've been a great part of my workflow. How can you integrate them in yours?\n\nI use these plugins frequently: Viveza 2, Color Efex Pro 4, Silver Efex Pro 2 and Output Sharpener (part of Sharpener Pro 3).\n\nViveza 2 is an overall exposure processing plugin, allowing management of brightness, contrast, saturation and structure. It's a great tool to add some punch and character to an image, provided you do so sparingly.\n\nColor Efex Pro 2 can be helpful for architecture, which is one of my specializations. There's a tool here called Remove Color Cast, which allows for management of color temperature in post -- after you've done your raw processing in lightroom or capture one.\n\nSilver Efex Pro 2 is an amazing black-and-white processing tool. There's a ton of creative reach here if you want to process an image in BW. Great tool.\n\nThe Output Sharpener of Sharpener Pro 3 is pretty great. Lightroom's sharpener sucks by comparison. I use it to add sharpening to web-ready images of smaller resolutions (2500px width for me) and I usually blend the sharpening layer in at a low opacity just to add a little bit of bite to textures where needed. If you shoot architecture or landscape, it can be a bit much on trees and greenery, so I usually mask out any sharpening on that stuff.\n\nEnjoy!

Both my wife and I are photographers.  We started back in the film days and I focused on black and white.  She in color.  I had my own dark room and I miss the days.  We shot several weddings in film back in the day.  Our customers were generally amazing prior to digital.  They knew they had to wait for the photos and our contracts were specific on what we were offering.  I can't remember a bad experience in the days of film regarding weddings.\n\nThen came the digital revolution and our \"niche\" industry was flooded with \"overnight professionals\".  We moved quite quickly to digital and found ourselves competing with the \"overnight professionals\" who would charge a fraction of the cost we were charging.  We were forced to lower our prices and eventually stopped shooting weddings altogether.  We found ourselves competing with stay at home moms with a digital hobby.  The biggest issue is that the quality of the overnight digital professionals was substandard and many at the time were offering to shoot a full wedding with pocket digital camera for $500.  How could we compete with this?\n\nGiven the shift in the market we began to phase out our wedding service.  We just could not do it.  To boot, new brides and mom's of the bride were now expecting a turn around of 1/4 of the time film took and we found ourselves in a position of trying to explain to almost every bride's mother that there is still quite a bit of post production before we could deliver the product which was always met with, well the other photographer says she could deliver in just two weeks etc.\n\nOne of our last weddings, was the last straw.  They booked one year in advance which required a non-refundable deposit if they cancelled 30 days before the shoot.  During the course of the year they had three discussions with us about pricing and we stood our ground.  We even offered to refund the deposit 3 months before the shoot and they could use the neighbors, friends wife.  Not kidding.  Day of the shoot or before we required, in contract, 50% of the fee.  We show up and the Bride's mother freaks out.  I'm not paying anything until I see the photos.  We pack up our gear in the truck and start to leave.  Father of the groom, stops us and writes us a check and we unload and start shooting.  We were a husband and wife team, so I go with the groomsmen and she with the bridesmaids.  It was the worst, most uncomfortable shoot of our lives.  The Bride and the Brides' mother were very difficult to work with and to please and at one point my wife broke down in tears.  In post-production, we received emails from the mother about one week after the wedding demanding to see the photos and we too got the same overtly threatening and slandering treatment the photographer got in the article.\n\nWe never shot a wedding again.\n\nPeople used to be nice, happy and pleasant.  Now everyone seems so angry, entitled and bitter.\n\nI for one am happy the photographer won the money."}, {"comment_id": "dl0phsm", "post_id": "6quno3", "comment": "Sites that don't allow ad-blockers are cancer."}, {"comment_id": "dl05tsl", "post_id": "6quno3", "comment": "/r/titlegore "}, {"comment_id": "dl0o9yf", "post_id": "6quno3", "comment": "can somebody explain to me how two shit people and a bunch of assholes on tv and reddit taking a business from 175 weddings (at $6000 per that's $1,050,000) a year to 2 weddings ($12,000) a year only garners a judgement of $1.08 million? as if the damage was only for the one year and not permanent?"}, {"comment_id": "dl0x3fj", "post_id": "6quno3", "comment": "One can be mean, but sometimes you have to pay for that luxury."}, {"comment_id": "dl14ak0", "post_id": "6quno3", "comment": "I'm immediately suspicious of anybody who lists their career as \"blogger\".

I didn't repair still cameras, but the rules and corporate relationships are the same. Here goes: \n\nAs an authorized servicer, you are NOT a representative of the manufacturer. The relationship is adversarial. Wasn't always this way. The manufacturers used to be supportive and easy to charge/bill. Things changed in the early 2000's. Especially with Sony. (That was when I left the industry for good). \n\nWhen you receive a unit for warranty repair you must be 110% it's a warranty failure that is chargeable. If you suspect the manufacturer will refuse the charges, then you are on your own with a customer who inevitably insists it's covered. We can't give away free repairs. Period. \n\nLiquid damage and corrosion damage are one and the same. It is an insidious problem. You can spent hundreds of dollars replacing damaged components, only to find that 2 months later some adjacent button, ribbon cable, or component was affected and failed. Now YOU are on the hook. Not Sony. \n\nManufacturers have a very strict hierarchy of warranty repair compensation for authorized servicers. Let's say it's an A7s II. Sony will offer a strict list of compensation for various defect repairs. I don't know the current list, but it usually looked something like this (numbers are made up, but typical): \n\n- Minor exterior part replacement, alignment or cleaning: $35.00\n\n- Minor disassembly, troubleshoot and repair to XY or Z areas: $90\n\n- Major disassembly and repair to XY or Z area: $149\n\n- Extensive replacement of major components: $189\n\n- Extensive replacement of major components and extensive calibration: $269\n\n- The slightest hint that the failure was liquid damage or customer handing: $0.00\n\nYou can see where the problems are. Authorized servicers get paid a pittance for warranty work. They make their money getting mid-level chargebacks for quick easy fixes. Ten $90 repairs will make the servicer far more money than one $269 major PITA fix. So basket case units are frowned upon. ESPECIALLY when there is the slightest hint of corrosion or handling damage. As soon as you seee ANY hairline crack or hint of corrosion, you must declare the warranty void because you will NOT get paid and it WILL come bite you in the ass later. \n\nThis is all borne of the movement in late 1990's away from quality and high-level support into an era of cheapness. Manufacturers will provide parts to authorized servicers, but they watch the servicers like a hawk. At the slightest whiff that the servicer misrepresented a warranty repair, all hell breaks loose. It is no longer a manufacturer-professional relationship. It's a prison guard - inmate relationship. That's why there are so few authorized servicers and the few that exist are so hyper-vigilant about warranty issues. Most of us got out while the getting was good. Those who survive do it on massive volume and intense scrutiny of cost/return. \n\nSome manufacturers are better than others. Some have their own in-country corporate servicers (Panasonic). Others are more liberal and supportive of their authorized servicers (Canon). But some are so stingy that after-sales support has all but crumbled (Sony). \n\nThis guy will NEVER get a warranty fix on that camera. At the slightest whiff of corrosion his warranty was null and void. Maybe Sony will react to this video, but I wouldn't count on it. His next video of \"I got a new camera!\" would open the floodgates of every douchebag who dropped his a7S II on the concrete and insists it's a warranty issue. \n\nIn short: before you buy, consider your needs (weather sealed or not) and look at the manual online. Contact the location shown as providing after sales service in your area. Tell them you have a unit and you aren't sure what the policies are about warranty repair. See how they react.\n\nHTH. \n "}, {"comment_id": "d6pankv", "post_id": "4yofu4", "comment": "Nikon service isn't cheap, but after my 70-200 VR got hit with a puck at an NHL game they took it apart, rebuilt it and recalibrated it.

I never so much as got a scratch or a scuff on it, never bumped or dropped it and it worked great... for about 2 months.\n\nIt started skipping. You'd have it on a flat, level surface, no vibration, no movement, and it would skip. Didn't matter what disc you put into it, or what track you tried to play, it would skip.\n\nI took it back to the store, \"Sure, no problem, we'll send it off and get it repaired.\" Off it would go, and then about 2 months... yes, about two months later it would come back. I was excited to have my CD player back, so I took it home, threw a disc in... skipping... nothing but skipping.\n\nBack to the store. Hey, it still skips, what's going on? Ok, back it goes to be repaired. 2-3 months later, it comes back. Still skips. Back it goes again. By the third time it came back still broken. I had had enough. This one is clearly a lemon, I don't want it \"fixed\", I want it replaced. I'm told no, we don't do that, but we can repair it. Off it goes again.\n\nEvery 3 months or so, I would get the Discman back, and would have a disc with me, in the store, and batteries with me, in the store. I would pop the disc in, pop the batteries in. Open the box right in front of the Sony Store guy, after he assured me that this time it's fixed. I'd hit play, and it would skip. We'd argue that the thing is clearly a lemon and should be replaced, but ultimately it would end up going back to their repair shop.\n\nThis went on for two years, until the warranty, and then the extended warranty ran out. Then once the extended warranty had ran out, I was told, sorry, we're not going to fix it unless you pay for us to fix it because it's no longer under warranty.\n\nAt that point I vowed to NEVER buy another Sony product EVER.\n\n**TL;DR** - Fuck Sony, when they sell you a defective product they weasel their way out of fixing it.

After a lot of reviews I settled on a Cybershot DSC TX5. This thing is waterproof up until 10 meters, dustproof, shockproof (1 meter or something) and me back some 300 euros and then 50 euros to extend my warranty from 2 years to 3. \n\nWe took this thing everywhere, mainly because it was built for that and hey, it's fun to have a camera that you can take to the pool without having to worry it's going to get wet, or make a video of a waterslide. Just becasue you usually aren't capable of doing these things. Very happy with it, we got nice pictures and a lot, mainly because well, you can and do take it anywhere and everywhere.\n\n2 years come and go and all of a sudden the thing starts malfunctioning. Not recognizing the SD, crashing, ... So I take in to the shop, claim my extra warranty and they fix it. Replaced the motherboard and all was well. Used for months after the repair until we took it swimming again.\n\nSomeone at the repair center forgot to waterseal the device again and some air bubbles came out. Air bubbles coming out means water going in. I take the thing out, pull the battery and leave it to dry to no avail. \n\nWent back to the shop, explain the situation that it wasn't water sealed after being repaired. They send it back to Sony and all I got from them was \"Water damage\". For a repair they botched. Spend a few weeks mailing back and forth, phoning them, trying to get it through their heads that THEY fucked up the first repair and that it's THEIR fault the thing is waterdamaged. To no avail.\n\nAt least the shop was kind enough to offer me 15% discount on my next purchase. As fond as I was of that camera, I will never again buy photographic equipment from Sony.

It can cost $10k to hire a professional photographer and actors and rent a studio for a shoot for a product like this, or $200 for a stock image, and you can have the stock image the same day.

This is why in film days I had an Olympus XA, Konica BM-300, Konica Hexar then my Leica kit..  but when the UFO lands next to you, the alien steps out and waves 'Hi', the best camera in the world is whatever you have with you... and that will most likely be a phone to capture THAT 'decisive moment'!\n\npeople would be shocked at how many pics in my gallery are from phones/tablets... yet I also have a pic used by a Leica distributor for displays...  so it's more about the image, less about the equipment"}, {"comment_id": "dvpqg0c", "post_id": "84ebwf", "comment": "I was going to comment \"Imagine how much better these pictures could be if the photographer used a proper camera\" but then I realized most of these pictures simply would not exist if he had tried to use a fancy camera."}, {"comment_id": "dvqa8up", "post_id": "84ebwf", "comment": "These pictures really embraces the idea of *\"f/8 and be there\"*, which is great for photojournalism.

It may seem trivial but the ISO setting doesn't change the camera's sensitivity to light. The camera has an inherent sensitivity to light, the ISO setting simply amplifies (mathematically or through hardware amplification), whatever the sensor captured.\n\nThis distinction becomes relevant in a number of instances. For example, many cameras offer DR modes that use lower levels of hardware amplification but still produce the expected image brightness by applying different tone curves (but without having over-amplified the highlight data).\n\nMore significantly, changing the ISO setting rarely increases noise to any significant degree (in some cameras it actually *decreases* it). This may sound counter-intuitive, but that's because you've misidentified the source of the noise you're seeing. Most of the noise in the image you show is a result of the shutter speed and aperture you chose (because those are the only parameters that change how much light your sensor captures). The noise you're seeing is the **shot noise** from the light, not 'digital noise.' \n\nWith many modern cameras you can prove this to yourself by shooting that same shot at base ISO and a high ISO setting, using the same shutter speed and aperture, then brightening the low ISO image to match the bright one. The noise will usually be the same, or very similar.\n\nWhich might lead you to conclude that exposure is actually more of a line than a triangle..."}, {"comment_id": "d4lycuf", "post_id": "4piejn", "comment": "except from reading two times about f16 to ensure max. depth of field and no mention of diffraction i'm ok with this"}, {"comment_id": "d4l9zmj", "post_id": "4piejn", "comment": "I don't understand why the \"Exposure Triangle\" diagram is so pervasive.

I've never met her, but about six months after I refused to shoot her she accused me of being a pedophile.\n\nThere have also been a few misunderstandings, such as a recent post by a new model who took a joking comment that if she didn't remove the hairband from her wrist she'd have to shoot nude as a serious threat. After she posted, the photographer apologized and numerous models that had shot with him assured the model that it was not meant as a threat.\n\nPhotographers will occasionally post about models that are unprofessional, but it is very rare, and usually is just for repeated no-show/no-call missed shoots.\n\nAll together, I think it is a very useful thing for models and photographers although it is certainly not comprehensive. There's one photographer who I know has been highly inappropriate who has never been named online.

As long as they're not grabbing ass or boob or doing it in a sleazy way I don't see the problem. But you have to consider the accusers definition of what they consider 'sleazy' to be. \n\nA facebook group is nor an agency or a union and should never be viewed as one. They do not have the same power. \n\n\"Catherine said the goal is to protect models, not tarnish reputations.\" Although one wrong accusation and a career is over. \n\n\"I always try to take a chaperone with me,\" Elliot said. \"If I am travelling to a shoot by myself, I'll make sure that somebody knows where I'm going \u2014 the address, the first and last name of the photographer\u2026 so that if something does go wrong, you have an idea of where to start looking. Heaven forbid.\" - If I'm buying something on Craigslist and meeting someone in a carpark I will tell someone where I'm going. I'm sorry but this is starting to sound more like people(models) who haven't a clue what they're doing. This is basic common sense. \n\n\"Catherine said if there is an allegation of assault, she does her best to research the allegation and contact the photographer concerned to get his part of the story.\" Do your best? What is your 'best'? Catherine seems to be judge, jury and executioner in this group, \"Catherine said she has looked into four claims of assault leveled against certain photographers. In three cases, she concluded the account was worth including in a post on the closed group's wall. In the fourth case, she decided the model had fabricated the story.\" SHE DECIDED??? Based on what? \n\nLets throw in Harvey Weinstein into the article, he's touched more than his fair share of women inappropriately and is a hot current topic, despite the fact that he has never been a photographer and is a (scummy) Hollywood producer. \n\nI think this explains it, \n\n\"Complaints from models don't often make it into the system because of a fear of losing contracts. That's due to the precarious nature of the work and a power imbalance between models and clients, particularly when the models are working freelance.\" So they are happy to not report this stuff but only if they get work out of it? Sorry, but if you had a problem with sucking a photographers dick to get a job then you probably shouldn't have done it in the first place and reported him TO THE POLICE NOT A FACEBOOK GROUP and maybe look for a new career. \n\nThe whole, 'this has always happened in our industry' story is starting to sound a bit repetitive. Are people going to forget about this kind of stuff happening in the modelling, film, acting industry next year when the next movement comes in? You bet ya. What was it last year? BLM or something about Trump? And everything will continue as it has been. Although maybe a new closed facebook group will be formed to talk about it. \n\nMy advice to any young aspiring model would be to have someone with you, if that's not possible tell someone where you're going, a time when you will call them to say everything went well, the address and name of the photographer. Tell the photographer at the beginning of the shoot if anything inappropriate happens, end of shoot. If they have a problem with this from the outset, leave. If you put up with any advances, that's your choice, don't go complaining to a closed FB group, call the cops like any normal person in a similar position. There are horrible people in every industry as we have learned over the past few months, no one should have to put up with stuff like this. But naming photographers in a closed FB group when Catherine is judge, jury and executioner is probably not the way to go. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dqy5hxt", "post_id": "7ie2jo", "comment": "Everyone is a victim"}, {"comment_id": "dqy4rz8", "post_id": "7ie2jo", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "d5io7ww", "post_id": "4tnfln", "comment": "I swear to god, you've got more talent in your pinky than I do in total x.x"}, {"comment_id": "d5ir50m", "post_id": "4tnfln", "comment": "Awesome!

They didn't speak to eachother for years. Meanwhile, my father got married, had a baby (my brother). A few monthes after my brother was born his wife died. This day (or really soon after that) my father completely stopped photography, got back in touch with his father, and went to medecine school. Then he met my mother, and then I was born. I always knew my father used to be a photographer, so when I was 14 I asked him to teach me to develop pictures (sorry if the photographic terms are wrong, I'm not native english speaker so...) This day was really special because it was the first time in years he developped pictures. He taught me how to use the  enlarger with a film with photos of my brother as a little baby, wich was the last film he developed before his first wife died, before he stopped photography.\nWe never did that again, not because he didn't wanted to but because I was a teenager and too obsessed by other stuff to realize the chance I had. Then I grew up, started to be interested in photography again, but I didn't really wanted to ask my father because I thought it would make him think about the bad stuff, and would make him sad. \nThen,  years ago, my father got cancer, it was really bad. He had the chance to be treated by an amazing doctor and an amazing surgeon, and now he's almost over it. This made me realize I needed to spend more time with my father, and photography was one thing I wanted to to with him. So I asked him for a camera, he just said he will \"see if he had something\". 2 monthes later he gave me what you've seen for my birthday. It's been 6 monthes now, and every time I see him he teaches me things about photography. And last month he bought a digital camera for himself and started to do photography again.\nMy father rocks. \n"}, {"comment_id": "c4r2ruu", "post_id": "tzafr", "comment": "My father had always dreamed of having a nice camera and learning photography.

It was just a Nikon N90, but for the time and for us, it was the nicest camera we could possibly afford.  I kept it until fifteen years later I received the Nikon D90 to replace it.  \n\nI drove to my dad's house (he was 70 at the time) with a box of film, some filters, a couple of lenses and my old Nikon.  I handed him the box with some DVDs on how to use it.  He opened it and I swear to God you would have thought I just handed him a million bucks.  He hugged me a hundred times and thanked me.  He kept saying, \"Are you sure?  Are you sure?\"  \n\nIt was the best feeling in the world.  He takes the pics at all our family gatherings now and makes us all freeze so he can reload film!
