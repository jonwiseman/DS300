The other thing to know, which properly frames the situation, is that the power distribution for a track like this is flawed. When you squeeze the trigger for both controllers, and there are two cars on the track, the power is distributed pretty evenly, but if one of the cars is knocked off the track or your opponent releases their trigger to break suddenly, then that power is instantaneously transferred to the other car and car number 2 sees a comparable boost in acceleration and velocity for the exact same applied trigger pressure.\n\nWhen I went to college I studied Electrical Engineering, and it makes sense as both tracks are wired in parallel, but at the time, it was just known as the method to knock your opponent from the track. Both racers accelerate so they are going as fast as they can without getting thrown from the track, then just before your opponent enters a turn, you drop your throttle and watch as your opponent now finds themselves accelerating into a turn.\n\nFor the rest of the evening my Father tried in vain to knock me from the track. He used every dirty trick he could, and because of the way the cars power were distributed, it often meant I could cause his plans to backfire.

What really needs to happen is for E3 to roll around. Let all the video game and console devs do their presentation. Then; when EA steps out, and only when EA steps out, people collectively 'boo' and turn their backs throughout the whole presentation. The only thing gamers can do short of buying absolutely 0 EA games (unlikely) which would tank stocks, is to show them their actions have reached a pinnical of disappointment for their consumers. That gamers wont even be bothered to be aware/present at their biggest yearly exposition.\n\nEdit: even I can't believe THIS is my top rated comment. I always assumed \"RIP inbox\" was a joke.\n\nEdit #2: Ok so since this is still a comment people are latching onto and I have access to my computer now, I guess I should make as few things a little clearer. I know it's all paid-to-clap press. Those people are paid to write 'best in E3 show!' 'Battlefront 2 made me cry!' '#newEAgamelooksdope' bias is part of their resume. 'Yes man' their label. My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal 'reporters' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who've been in a guild, it's common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one. I would assume this applies double for trying to ban a publisher. At this point, all you can do is the single most damaging thing to a major corporation; and that is to tank their stocks. Their PR will kiss shit stained player ass and do it with a smile. That's their job. What we need to start thinking as a whole collective is how to make their stock holders and CEO's start applying rose red lipstick and considering their go-to tongue action move. This means, actively boycotting all their products. Which nobody will do. I'm favor of a comment I saw where someone suggested, as far as Battlefront II was concerned, attack Disney. I agree with u/roxwar. >EA doesnt own star wars, Disney does and if theres one thing Disney absolutely will not tollerate, its bad press surrounding their brand. You want to punish EA? Then you need to take to social media and tag disney in this shitshow and express your disgust at their assosiation with gambling boxes in video games obviously aimed at children.\n\nI'd assume Disney saw the EA stocks and figured they could do no wrong. Disney stopped selling magic and childhood dreams mid-80's. What the fuck do they know about fun and happiness (anybody who points to their theme parks have clearly never stood 4-hours in line for a five minute ride)? That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games.

But then nothing in the game was ever improving, the game felt worse with each release.  Each iteration of the game felt like a dumb downed recycled version of the last.  Every year the game felt more random and we were losing actual control of of our players.  Frustration finally led to all of us not buying 17.  My brother tried the 18 beta and was like yeah nevermind I know why we stopped.  \n\n\nThe only thing they update and care about is their HUT bullshit.  Because people drop stacks to buy more and more card packs.   Our boycott hurts, I miss hockey, but I finally decided after 4 years of declining user experience it was finally time.

Evangelicals have always had a hate-hate relationship with pop culture, but D&D panic became mainstream a little bit due to the general \"Satanic panic\" craze, as well as a specific case with James Dallas Egbert where lawmen incorrectly speculated D & D drove his behavior (a failed suicide attempt.) The old movie Mazes and Monsters is a fictionalized retelling of that case.\n\nThe Satanic Panic in general is something that tends to be forgotten now. People believed that there were cabals of satanists around that abused children and did other nasty things, due to a couple trials that heavily relied on the now discredited idea of repressed memories. This was mostly a secular idea. The meme joke \"show me on the doll where he touched you\" came from this, but was used along with leading questions to get vulnerable kids to confess to being abused in utterly bizarre and false ways. It's something that reads like it was straight out of fiction, but it really happened in the 1980s, and D&D was close enough to get hit in the crossfire from it.\n\nIt happened mostly as a reaction to the rise of mass media and the pretty harsh amount of social change we saw in the 80s. It's actually scarier that it was forgotten so quickly; if you grew up in that time, the fact that people literally thought it existed, and that it shaped pop culture in not a few ways, has always troubled me. It actually affected Christian fundamentalist belief in that it spawned the \"spiritual warfare\" trope and heightened belief in the existence and power of demons to influence people's behavior. A good example of this is in the novel \"This Present Darkness\" by Frank Peretti, which was my generation's Left Behind. And people actually milked this behavior; the Christian comedian Mike Warnke among others actually claimed to be ex satanists of the moral panic variety.\n\nIt's really a cautionary tale of how people act during times of social panic and what can set them off. It's not actually religion alone; religious people opposed the advent of the bar code, for one, and never saw the level of demonization at the secular level we did with D&D. (Though we do have to thank them for really linking bar codes with dehumanization, for example; sometimes religious critique can actually be dead on in emotional tone, while not on facts.) But if secular people on the whole are vulnerable, you get these ideas transmitted widespread.\n\nJust posting this if you think parents forbidding people from playing D&D is solely hyper religious nutcases. A lot of secular people fell for it too, and its too easy to fall into the idea that normal people can't fall prey to moral panic ideas.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "drqlnol", "post_id": "7m13gd", "comment": "Ha nerds"}, {"comment_id": "drql8pv", "post_id": "7m13gd", "comment": "Enjoy your time in the [Fires of Hell](https://olddungeonmaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/fires-of-hell-5e.pdf), old man."}, {"comment_id": "drqlryg", "post_id": "7m13gd", "comment": "Is this starter set good?

You are able to view and load all websites equally, because there are rules in place that require companies like Comcast and AT&T to do so. These are considered net neutrality rules, and because of these rules it prohibits those companies like Comcast and AT&T from throttling or blocking access to certain websites.\n\nThey are trying to change those rules, and when I say change - I mean the FCC is going to vote to appeal these rules in the next month! This is serious, because once it's repealed the flood gates open to let ISPs do charge us for more and more stuff. If you're complaining about how much you pay for internet and cable now, then you better be worried about what will happen if this does get repealed. If Congress gets enough calls, they can stop this. \n\nInstead of treating everyone equally, the Comcasts and AT&Ts of the world are trying to make internet a \"tiered\" level service. You would have to pay to get access or faster loading times on specific websites. For example: Having to pay $10 more a month for YouTube or Facebook access.

The internet is free and open post-2015, but with the additional security of these intrusions being illegal, not addressed reactively once discovered, sometimes after years.\n\n\nMyth: Title II regulations haven\u2019t reduced infrastructure investment and broadband deployment.\nFact: Among our nation\u2019s 12 largest internet service providers, domestic broadband capital expenditures decreased by 5.6 percent percent, or $3.6 billion, during the first two years of the Title II era. Title II also has hurt smaller providers\u2019 ability to get financing and reduced infrastructure investment. In short, Title II has slowed broadband deployment and hampered the FCC\u2019s efforts to close the digital divide.\n\nAdditional Fact: One could have said the same thing after the FCC classified cable internet as Title I in 2002: investment fell then, too. The statistics above, however, are rather misleading. Many major internet providers have increased spending, or projected the decreases mentioned years ahead of time. This article puts some of the numbers in context, and has the bonus of coming from Free Press, an outlet Pai attempted to discredit today by pointing out that it was a socialist publication \u2014 yes, really.\n\nMyth: Title II regulations are good for broadband competition.\n\nFact: Title II is a regulatory framework designed to regulate the Ma Bell telephone monopoly, not to encourage new entrants into the marketplace. And a regulatory framework designed for a monopoly will tend to push the marketplace toward a monopoly. Smaller, competitive broadband providers do not have the same resources as larger companies to cope with increased regulatory costs and have scaled back broadband deployment as a result of Title II.\n\nAdditional Fact: Title II was indeed created a long time ago in a different age \u2014 of course, you could say that about practically any law written more than 20 years ago. Laws are made to last for decades, even centuries, with the help of judicial interpretation (in this case, the Supreme Court supported Title II classification) and legislative amendment (in this case, the 1996 Telecommunications Act). It also already applies to many of the companies involved in some fashion; companies like AT&T and Verizon have built their mobile networks under Title II oversight and thrived. Also, as the 2015 order points out, very few sections of Title II are actually being applied. There is also an exemption for smaller ISPs with up to hundreds of thousands of subscribers to avoid exactly this outcome.\n\nMyth: Title II regulations are good for online privacy.\n\nFact: Title II put Americans\u2019 online privacy at risk by stripping the Federal Trade Commission of its jurisdiction over broadband providers\u2019 privacy and data security practices. Ending Title II will restore the FTC\u2019s authority and return to a tried-and-true approach that successfully protected consumers\u2019 privacy prior to 2015. It will put our nation\u2019s most experienced and expert privacy agency back on the broadband beat.\n\nAdditional Fact: Title II did shift authority for privacy and security practices from the FTC to the FCC, which then put stronger rules in place to address some internet provider-specific vulnerabilities. Those stronger rules were repealed before taking effect last month, an action Chairman Pai approved of. Now neither agency is protecting consumers and that isn\u2019t likely to change any time soon.\n\nMyth: Title II regulations are good for innovation.\n\nFact: The Commission\u2019s 2015 Title II internet regulations have deterred internet service providers from offering new and innovative services to consumers. For example, 22 small providers, each of which has fewer than about 1,000 customers, has told the FCC that because of Title II \u201ceach of us has slowed, if not halted, the development and deployment of innovative new offerings which would benefit our customers.\u201d\n\nAdditional Fact: There is no conceivable \u201cinnovative new offering\u201d that could be brought by an under-1,000-subscriber ISP that would be blocked by the Open Internet Order, which bans paid prioritization, throttling, traffic interference and misleading commercial terms. If it was yet another zero-rating plan, then, as I\u2019ve pointed out, the truly innovative offering would be removing data caps.\n\nMyth: Title II regulations are good for free speech and free expression.\n\nFact: Government regulation is not the friend of free speech, but an enemy. For example, the First Amendment doesn\u2019t give the government power to regulate. It denies the government that power. Additionally, greater government regulation of the internet is strongly supported by many who are fundamentally hostile to free speech.\""}, {"comment_id": "dqr22gv", "post_id": "7ek4q6", "comment": "The issue of neutrality needs to stop being framed as a slowdown of your interests argument.

It takes so much time, effort, and in many cases planning, to achieve something like this. You have to know how each block\u2019s color and texture looks from far away. You have to know how to arrange blocks in a specific way to look curved from far away, and different angles of curves are made different ways. It may \u201conly\u201d be sitting at a computer and clacking away at a mouse and keyboard, but that shouldn\u2019t automatically rule it out as a form of art. It takes as much practice and passion as painting, sculpting, songwriting, etc. I do works similar to this all the time, but more building-esque rather than sculptures, but I\u2019m still constantly learning new things about what I think looks good, how to make good curves, spacing, natural vs artificial, and much, much more, just like with any other artistic craft.

FIFA hacking was apparently a thing.  Someone hacked my account and used it to cheat in FIFA (no idea how that works) and do a ton of monetary transactions.\n\nEA perma-banned my account.  That may not seem like such a big deal, especially at the time as Origin was new and I didn't have many purchases there.  But the problem was that I had -- as so many do -- linked accounts.   My EA account was linked to my Xbox Gamertag.   This meant that I could not play any EA game on Xbox or PC.   Every single title would \"phone home\", see my EA account was banned, and I couldn't play.   It didn't matter if it was a Single-Player game, it wouldn't work.  Changing Gamertag wouldn't work either, I would have had to get an entirely new XBL account to play ANY EA title ever again.\n\nI determined that Microsoft gave them access to my email account (via \"social engineering\" -- they basically begged customer service for the password -- MS admitted this to me and were apologetic FWIW) which allowed them to bypass account security and get into my EA account.\n\nI got an affidavit from Microsoft admitting they allowed an unauthorized party to access my account just minutes before the FIFA cheating occured.    EA could see that I don't own, nor have ever played (outside of this hacking incident) a FIFA or any other EA Sports game for that matter.   Their responses all the way to the top of their customer service organization admitted all of this.  But they still refused to unlock my account, each time giving the whole \"we take hacking seriously\" mumbo-jumbo.\n\nI eventually had to get my lawyer to send them a notice that I was exercising my rights to arbitration (the only recourse you allow yourself when agreeing to ToS) to settle the issue.   And they STILL wanted to fight.   EA fired back stating that their ToS states that in cases of \"Hacking\" the user loses all rights to the arbitration process.  So my lawyer had to notify them that, since their ToS effectively left me with no legal recourse under its terms, it was nullified and we would simply sue them the old-fashioned way.\n\nEventually they caved.  Literally took years.   After the first couple months it was more the principle of the matter than anything.\n\nI don't link any of my accounts with anything anymore.

To those of you using video games as an outlet, an escape, an oasis even, don't forget the value of putting as much time into bettering your own life as you do bettering those of NPCs and protagonists. Master Chief can save planets, Mario can save galaxy's, and YOU can save YOURSELF. Which, albeit, is much harder to accomplish, but if I know our community, I know that you are up for the challenge. Godspeed friends.\n\nSincerley,\n\nSome random gamer with anxiety and depression."}, {"comment_id": "ehcmafn", "post_id": "av4kpi", "comment": "Hey, don\u2019t forget to fuel your body with the important nutrients that come from consuming an entire Totino\u2019s party pizza and bag of nacho flavored Doritos.

I was a burden on my family. 20 years old, no job, no license (or car) so I have been guilty that is for sure.\n\nBut there is hope. I believe I had an addiction to escaping my issues in life and video games (specifically MMORPGS) provided me the perfect outlet to live a life I had complete control over and could be anyone I wanted. I was a valued member of my community (guild) and everyone loved my presence and needed me. They were feelings I wanted in my real life but had no idea how to obtain them.\n\nAnyway, if you are reading this and you feel similarly and need help, reach out. You can live a happy life outside of the game, with a little hard work and support.\n\nEdit:\nI have been asked by several people what I did, so, here it is.\n\nTo be completely honest, I reached a point where I told myself I either need to kill myself or I need to start making changes, because the life I was living was cumbersome on everyone around me and myself.\n\nI opted to change things. In the end I decided that while yes, the life I was living WAS burdensome, my suicide would only further that burden and perhaps further senses of regret and resentment.\n\nI decided that I needed a job, that would be a huge first step toward self improvement. I worked it out so that for every 3 job applications, I could play for one hour.\n\nSo this is the hard part, holding yourself accountable. How do you hold yourself accountable when youre dealing with an addiction? I'll be honest again, I think it boils down to how bad do you want a change in your life. If it is something you go in to just to SAY that you are making changes, you will give up in a week due to not holding yourself accountable.\n\nLong story short, I accepted the first job I could possibly find and took off from there. The first step is the most important, because it can snowball from there.\n\nFour years ago I was unemployed and gaming to the point it was unhealthy. Now, I'm a father of 3 (one adopted) working at a very good (blue collar) job for my area, working anywhere from 40 to 55 hours a week. I game about 8 hours a week now if time permits.\n\nYou don't have to quit gaming altogether but you really need to get your life in order before you jump back in to it. You need a healthy balance, it's crucial. I didn't game for two years after I got that first job.\n\nAnyway, if you have any questions I will be here. \n\nEDIT2: Someone asked me what I did for getting back in to then community and finding a sense of purpose that I wrote below\n\nWell, hmm..\n\nThe first thing I can suggest is that you should look for a job that will provide a lot of social interaction, be it with customers or coworkers. If you show up somewhere long enough, you will eventually become friends with someone.\n\nAs for purpose or meaning, I think that it is obviously subjective. My initial goal was just to become integrated in society and develop friendships and a sense of Independence.\n\nAfter that, well, I had a son on the way so my next step was to mature quickly and become the best father I could possibly be, which is something I am still trying to do 2 years later.\n\nNow everyone's goals will differ from mine. I in no way suggest going out and having a child, as a matter of fact I suggest waiting tilyou are established before you have a child.\n\nI might suggest looking into a form of higher education or a tradeskill like welding or HVAC.\n\nAnything else you would like me to touch on?

Each class of ghost would have different weaknesses and strengths.\n      2. Maybe have a hunter class focused on identifying weaknesses\n   2. Also, make the ghosts extremely powerful to further require teamwork\n      1. As a bonus this would heighten tension and horror!\n2. Lack of Content\n   1. As seen with \"Evolve\", lack of different modes and maps killed the game off pretty quick.\n\nFinal Side Note\n\n1. A cool twist could be the introduction of neutral ghosts or \"apex\" ghosts. These ghosts would be extremely difficult to kill and their objective would be more complex then just killing the hunters. They would instead be about ensuring balance and would have abilities to help both sides in a goal to keep the game going.

He had a reputation for not compromising on quality, both in his videos and in the games he reviewed/commentated on. His favorite thing to do was report on the quality of a game's options menu and the overall quality of a videogame console port, and held all mainstream games in high standards.\n\nHe had a very professional, strict attitude towards his job and his field, giving no quarter to the things he saw as flaws while trying to keep his criticism constructive, in a tough but fair way. He led a push for game developers to include field-of-view sliders into their games, and was an advocate of broader accessibility options.\n\nHis regular indie-focused series \"WTF Is...?\" helped a ton with getting lesser-known good indie games into the eyes of the public, with some indie games owing most of their popularity to him.\n\nHe contributed greatly to the Starcraft 2 e-sports scene, both by taking his vast fanbase into it by commentating popular tournaments and by hosting cash prize tournaments himself, managing to get some of the best players on the show.\n\nHe held a gaming news and commentary podcast called the Co-Optional Podcast, one of the most popular gaming podcasts around, if not the one that started the trend, where he would invite gaming personalities every week and host a talk show about current events and new game releases.\n\nHis personal politics were inspired by reason, never taking a strong stance toward any side that wasn't his own. This managed to, of course, piss some people off, and if you ever hear anything about him hosting or contributing to any harrassment campaigns, rest assured it is a complete and total lie.\n\nOf note is that he fought against his cult of personality. He did not want to look down upon his fans, and disliked the term *fan* as it started out as a shorthand for \"fanatic\", while TB wanted his viewers to be independent. He rejected seeing his viewers as a mindless mass of people but would still go out of his way, setting time aside, to interact with them whenever he got the occasion, at cons, tournaments and trade shows. He liked to see us as equals instead of servants, followers or apostles.\n\nAll in all, gaming has lost greatly with his passing, and he will be dearly missed by many."}, {"comment_id": "dzj4k93", "post_id": "8lwzqs", "comment": "And so, it begins.\n\nDark were the skies, and chill was the wind as the land was covered in a veil of malice.\nAcross the hill did ride a dread army of the night; cloaked in mist and fog, prepared to rain down death and destruction upon the land.\n\nAnd the people cried out for a savior, a noble soul to save them from their impending demise!\nJust when it seemed all was lost, in strode a mighty hero clad in shimmering metal from head to toe.\n\nWielding a terrible broadsword, he did cleave his foes in twain, smashing their axe asunder with a righteous fury!\n\nAnd when the day was done, and the enemy strewn across the field in pieces, the people did turn to the warrior and say:\n\"We shall name this day in your honor; speak unto us your wisdom.\"\nSlowly, the warrior did turn to face the assembled crowd.

AND you have the time to not just beat them all, but do EVERYTHING in them in the time it'd take you to otherwise grind for all of that.**\n\n----\n\nYes I'm aware you need EITHER 4528 hours *or* $2100 to unlock everything, not both. I just thought both were very interesting factors to calculate: how much time is 4528 hours really, when it comes to gaming, and how much money it is, too. \n\nAlso, a few things about the method used.  \nI tried to include the most important, most critically acclaimed games, above all. Of course I had to choose which ones to leave out, so there's some of my opinion in there, too. Feel free to swap whatever game or system you want, to make your own list, if you feel like it. \n\nOverall I tried to include a bit of everything, from many different series and genres (even ones I don't like as much). I know it's missing a lot of sports and music based games especially, I just don't know these well enough, personally.\n\nReally quick, you'll also notice HowLongToBeat times are rounded down, I didn't want to bother with half hours. I also don't agree with all of them necessarily, but I wanted a more objective place to take these times from. It's not like I've beaten all the games in this list 100% myself, anyway.\n\n---\n\nAs for the prices...  \nFor consoles and games still sold in stores, I went with the current, official retail price. Same for downloadable games, I used the Playstation and Xbox store websites to check that.\n\nFor consoles and games not sold anywhere anymore, I went to amazon, and went with the average price of used copies. That's why some rarer games (Melee for example) cost more than others.\n\nI also went with the best versions of each game, when possible. So HD collections and remasters, instead of resorting to finding a used copy of the game on Amazon (which would've been cheaper). Made it a bit more challenging not to go over $2100."}, {"comment_id": "dpuv7vb", "post_id": "7d3iqg", "comment": "I said it when DLC first became a thing, and I'll say it again now:  The end goal for game publishers is to turn our homes into remote arcades.

I would never do business with anyone who tried to take advantage of me to that degree of any deal. My business with EA is done. If we all did this, EA would go away and game developers would never try this again. I don't care how many games I miss out on, it will be worth it to remove this practice that is destroying franchises I love. This whole money grab is what ruined KOTOR and so many other games. \n\n(Edit) Wow this post is blowing up. I know KOTOR was not made be EA, but Bioware switched the entire concept of the game and instead of KOTOR III we got a shitty MMO obviously trying to profit off the popularity of the series instead of staying true to the series itself. The reason I brought this up was that if an example is made here. Perhaps future series wont get destroyed that way. I love KOTOR 1 and 2 AND I WANTED MORE OF THEM!\n\n(Edit 2) It's not whether or not they changed the game to what we wanted it's the fact that they tried to really take advantage of a fanbase to make obscene profits. I don't trust them, I wont do business with them (buy a game from them), period. Do what ever you want, buy the game, but for the first time we are looking at the power of consumers. The power is on our end we don't buy their games they go out of business, and some of our favorite franchises go back in the hands of people who maybe actually have a passion for making them. \n\n(Edit 3) Just a final note, make no mistake this event is really fascinating from an economic stand point. We witnessed a type of negotiation that is typically only possible on a small scale, one-on-one transactions. Only this is a massive publicly traded company and a large online community that organized itself effectively enough to dictate the terms of a sale. It's like everyone getting together and saying, we are going to stop buying gold until it's cheaper. It literally changes the market immediately because the consumer dictates the price. It really could have lasting implications if groups can organize this well over the internet. I would be interested if anyone knows if this has ever happened so clearly before. \n\n(Edit 4) Some have asked for another edit to answer some of the replies to edit 3. The general reaction from reddit is that many people feel like this is a great example of why net neutrality is important. The FCC could potentially abuse power without it and shut down consumer organizing like this. We would have no way to say FU to the suits at the top of the hill. Finally, this is a great representation of how out government works. Vote in local elections, vote for your representatives in 2018, I don't care what side of the tracks you are on, VOTE.

The general managers\u2019 salaries were capped and any starting general managers will be unable to go above $45k.

I would generally ask for the commission cost of the job and a half with no further actions taken.

It's cash and if they want to send one along as a sorry then so be it. But ALWAYS go for the cash payment and ALWAYS know that you are in the right and they are very much in the wrong (although to be fair this could very well be just an outsource design company, one they should probably avoid using in the future) best of luck! \n\n*This blew up....\n\nThere's a lot of interesting debates going on in the comments. It would be best for folks to not take such an aggressive position against something they have no first hand experience in and are basing everything they know on a quick Google and some biased reasoning. The fact is art and ideas are stolen every day for profit in lateral fields, and I would guess that 99% of individuals either never find out or if they do never pursue reparations because it seems complex and scary and the big guy will always win, so why bother. For the 1% that understand the value of an idea, no matter how simple or complex they may be, it's important to support them, it's how we as consumers end up benefitting from their continued work. A smart plagiarist might stay in business for years by hacking the spark that others use to ignite their creativity, but once that light goes out why bother creating anything new at all. Advertising when executed with class leads to a lot of really satisfying, thought provoking and entertaining work. I bought an amazing book called Advertising published by Thames and Hudson and I find it to be the most inspiring collection of work when I'm feeling stuck or have some creative block, but the inspiration ends when I feel as though I'm leaning on those ideas too heavily. In any case, the outcome will\nBe interesting, goodwill from Microsoft can fix it easily, and if the designer is a third party it may spell the end of their relationship with MS. In any case, it's probably too early to say he is definitely owed something substantial, but equally it is far too late to say he is owed nothing at all, the advert went to global marketing release, and it was his/her idea.

The penalties depend on the nature of the violation. The remedies that the FTC or the courts have imposed include:  Cease and desist orders. These legally-binding orders require companies to stop running the deceptive ad or engaging in the deceptive practice, to have substantiation for claims in future ads, to report periodically to FTC staff about the substantiation they have for claims in new ads, and to pay a fine of $41,484 per day per ad if the company violates the law in the future.  Civil penalties, consumer redress and other monetary remedies. Civil penalties range from thousands of dollars to millions of dollars, depending on the nature of the violation. Sometimes advertisers have been ordered to give full or partial refunds to all consumers who bought the product.  Corrective advertising, disclosures and other informational remedies. Advertisers have been required to take out new ads to correct the misinformation conveyed in the original ad, notify purchasers about deceptive claims in ads, include specific disclosures in future ads, or provide other information to consumers.\"(edited)  \n\n\nLets make this happen"}, {"comment_id": "eankp8t", "post_id": "a17g0s", "comment": "Do that on Amazon or Ebay and you got a problem.\n\nIts interesting how quickly a good name gets ruined once they start lying and pulling fast ones. \n\nI fear the worst for Elderscrolls 6.

I pictured a room full of devs, making a new thing in 5 minutes, and laughing all the way to the bank. And the content never stopped coming. I went on a trip that forced me off the game for a couple days (no connectivity) and when I came back, that setback was the motivation I needed to delete the game.\n\nNow I refuse to play mobile games that give benefits to even simple things like daily check-ins.

In the prime slot. After teasing fans that it's \"a great year to be a Diablo fan.\"\n\nThe only people paying any attention to Blizzcon are fans and industry insiders. The only people there in person are fans and industry insiders who have paid hundreds of dollars to be there. \n\nThe backlash is because they announced a mobile game to an audience of fans with no interest in mobile games, and then acted like condescending jerks when the fans tried to probe to see if maybe they were missing something. \n\nThe audience questions I've seen all amounted to confused attempts to gain better insight into why this is being announced/hyped to the 'core audience' who have absolutely no interest in it. That's why the guy was asking about plans to port it to PC. Because if this was eventually going to be ported, then it makes sense why they'd announce it to the superfans like that. The second question was a fan dead serious asking \"Is this an out of season April Fool's joke?\" because that's how bewildered the audience was by this announcement.

But if he comes at it from the side, like signing a forged decree to disband, then he can defeat the pawn - and if the pawns capture this church and pillage it (obviously you've got to be quite creative and flexible with these ideas) then it's possible too. This accounts for most chess situations, like two pawns facing off is two legions not wanting to go in to full head on battle - cavalry need to flank and can move quickly through forces and areas, two castles onthe same line make a wall of sorts, and if you enter the king's court he can behead you no matter who you are.

I was first introduced to Halo in the third grade by a good friend of mine from school. He spoke of a Master Chief, an Arbiter, Grunts, Brutes, Spartans, and such things almost every day. They all went completely over my head, but he spoke with such enthusiasm that the words stuck with me for years to come. A time or two he invited me to his house to play Halo 3 on his Xbox 360, and I remember fighting in a private multiplayer party in Mombasa, firing rockets through the big wheel on that map for no real reason other than to screw around and have fun. He left that same year, but I never forgot the fun we had and the name Halo.\n\nYears later, I finished the 10th grade and was moving abroad with my family. With all of my possessions packed away and virtually locked in an Airbnb for the better part of two months, I turned to YouTube. My mind called back to the names of Halo and Red vs. Blue. I put them in the search bar, and my world has been changed ever since.\n\nIn the two years since those summer days, I have become enamored with the games, world and community Bungie and 343 have built, but never set foot in them. My parents were always a little stingy about multiplayer games and buying a console when we had a perfectly good PC. So I never played a Halo game except for Halo Wars on a Steam trial weekend. I have looked and continue to look forward to Installation 01, what I once thought was my one chance at playing a Halo FPS on a PC.\n\nNow I hear of this.\n\nI look forward to joining the Halo community as a rookie and perhaps capturing a part of a childhood I never had, and doing my friend from years ago proud."}, {"comment_id": "eidtvsd", "post_id": "b0d4f2", "comment": "Are we finally going to be able to co-op these games on pc?

The choice/ability to withold money puts the customer in positon of leverage.\n\nNet neutrality is different. This is a decison being spearheaded by the FCC with politicians ultimately having the final say. The people in this case are at the mercy of those in power, and can only beg and plead, hoping someone will listen. There are few to no drawbacks for politicians to vote for this initiative (arguing that politicians want to get re-elecred is a moot point becauae they simply just have to say the right words during a campaign season, additionally the abysmally low approval ratings for congress does not seem to impede represenatives re-elections) which ultimately means that the people cannot easily sway them by conventional means.\n\nTLDR; People can directly affect EA by simply witholding their money.

People despise that shit.

Make an apology to the OP and your followers. Apology to OP is: \"I'm sorry I did not give proper credit to you. This was my bad\". Apology to your followers is: \"I'm sorry that I asked you to brigade the reddit thread. That was not acceptable of me\".  \n\n* Follow up with a self-reflection. \"I realize that in this day of age what I did was not acceptable. I will take a good hard look at myself and what has led to this issue\".  \n\n* Finish with a promise that this mistake will not happen again. \"From now on I will make sure to give credit to anyone that I quote, get inspiration from, etc.\"  \n\n* Final apology. \"Once again I'm really sorry...\"  \n\n* Do not, I repeat, **do not** attack anyone during this apology.

The lighting, the bump mapping, the physics, the AI, the vehicle mechanics, the skyboxes, the soundtrack, the LAN parties, the co-OP, the Assault on the Control Room. Hands all the way to fucking Australia, Halo is the most groundbreaking videogame of all time. Half-Life was a huge inspiration, especially when it came to the security guard interaction and outerworldly design, but Halo really stomped all over it.\n\nIn my opinion, Halo is absolutely the best game of the 2000's.

You have to go to the North Pole to restock and the elves give you different missions (such as go to X apartment complex in the ghetto and deliver PlayStations to underprivileged kids without getting robbed, etc).  You also have to make sure your reindeer are happy and in good shape, and make sure your sleigh is fully functional. Hell, you can even upgrade your sleigh with rocket launchers and sentry guns (you know, to ward off the military when you accidentally fly over a no fly zone or whatever).

It still has the original receipt and everything (bought at K-mart, which helps age it a bit!). \n\nEdit: wanted to hijack this comment to tell y'all I'll update this comment with more pictures when I get home from work! Didn't expect this to blow up so I wasn't prepared. \n\nEdit 2: Just want to add some more information while I'm sitting on the train back home:\n\nMy great grandmother, aka \"Nana\", recently passed away at the young age of 95. She was an absolute hoot and always had a smile on her face. She loved to dance and bragged about her boyfriends in the nursing home. She's at peace now, and that makes me happy. \n\nShe lived in a big ol trailer for the last 15-20 years of her life, in a assisted living community. It got bad in the last couple of years, and she was living at an elderly home for the final couple of years. During that time me and the family chipped away at sorting out her things in her trailer. I found the NES tucked away in the back of a closet in the living room, where it's likely been for the last 30ish years. I should also mention we found about $10k worth of cash, wrapped in tin foil, spread out throughout the trailer. Unfortunately I didn't get to keep any of that! \n\nMy great grandfather, aka Big Papa (unrelated to Biggie) is the one who actually purchased the system back in the late 80's. I thought I remembered the exact date, but a user kindly pointed out that the orange Zapper wasn't introduced till 1989 (after lawsuits with the all-grey zapper). I believe it was purchased around Christmas time, and was intended for my uncle Arty, aka Crazy Uncle Arty * I might've mixed up a detail here and it was for my uncle, not my great uncle, apologies. He was a jokester, and I can 100% imagine him getting in trouble for something and never getting to actually play with it. Unfortunately these people are no longer with us, so finding out the real story isn't possible. \n\nAddressing the people yelling at me for opening it: the box was already opened, I swear!! You can see some tears and such on the corners. Based on the box, I totally expected it to be used, but when I opened it up I was shocked. It was truly like a time capsule. When I saw the receipt was from K-mart I chuckled, as I haven't seen one of them in decades (southeast US). \n\nI'm not planning on selling it, no matter if it's worth $200 or $2,000. You don't find things like this often and honestly, I think I'll just keep it as is as a family heirloom. Also, to those wondering, I'm 24 years old. \n\nI'll be home in about an hour from now (5:19 PM) and will update with more pictures. So put the pitchforks down for now, my friends! Good things come to those who wait!\n\nFinal edit: You asked for 'em, and here they are. [More pictures, including the original receipt!](https://imgur.com/a/PKMO9pv) Based on the date of purchase (3/17/91), I was wrong about the Christmas story. Possibly a birthday?

I have the same thing all wrapped up and twisty tied in all the little plastic baggies. \n\nI was on a food delivery and I had a regular guy I'd deliver to who was pretty disabled. He'd leave his place open at all times so he didn't have to get up from his mat he slept on/ate on/smoked on/etc. It was like the 30th time I delivered to him and at this point I'd just go in, sometimes with the 30pack of cheap beer he'd have me pick-up on the order, and sit with him for a bit to have smoke together. We talked about video games and I told him about my collection of game stuff. **\"YOU COLLECT VIDEOGAME STUFF??... CHECK THIS OUT!!\"** \n\n(This guy, I kid you not, has nothing in his apartment except a SEGA that's always turned on playing some baseball game, maybe 5 dishes, and 2 beaten up white cardboard boxes with records in them.)\n\nHe proceeds to open a closet and unveil this mint condition NES exactly just like OPs. Said he got it from his aunt when they found it in their grandmas attic. Said she bought it for Xmas and never gave it to the grandchildren. I asked him what he wanted for it, he said 50 bucks. So I gave him all my tip money that night and scored a mint condition NES. Thanks Rick. "}, {"comment_id": "edu2o95", "post_id": "aez94q", "comment": "Dude, youre rich!

We did have a Beta that was given to us. Movies on that were hard to come by. \n\nOur house got broken into not that long after we had gotten our Nintendo. They trashed the place, poured my Michelangelo shampoo all over my baby book and stuff I had collected as a kid, and of course, stole the Nintendo. I was crushed. Still remember the feeling of coming home from school with my brother, opening the front door and seeing the place destroyed. \n\nProps to my brother, though. I was maybe 8 or 9 at the time. He would have been 11 or 12. He saw that the house was trashed and just yelled \u201cMom and Dad we\u2019re going to our friends house\u201d and we took off to the neighbours house. \n\nI don\u2019t know why I felt the sudden urge to talk about that.
