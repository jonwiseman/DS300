I got into the game when I was in junior high/high school, when the game was in Classic/BC. I didn't follow many online gaming news outlets. I mainly just got my news and game releases from my brother, who was out of college. Eventually, though, I got sucked into WoW. I also wanted something more from it. I started finding various communities and websites myself, and I eventually found my way to TotalBiscuit and WoW Radio.\n\nEventually, John left WoW behind, but he was still prominent on other fronts. He was a frontiersman in the young industry of gaming journalism. He never failed to always have a constant stream of content. Did a genuinely good PC game just launch? There was a video about it. Was a game running lower than 60fps? You bet your ass he complained about it. Was a game company acting dishonestly? John was there to breathe down their necks.\n\nThe man moved continents in every community he touched. If you're part of any big community built around a game, he likely touched that game, even for a little bit. He did a lot for League of Legends. He damn near built the SC2 community himself in its early days.\n\nI admit I haven't watched him as much as I used to, but if I was interested in a PC game, I always looked to see what he had to say about it. Hell, I even bought a Switch game (Mario + Rabbids) because of him. I'm scrolling down my Steam collection now. Games that he influenced my purchase of:\n\n* Awesomenauts\n* Banished\n* Bastion\n* Battleblock Theater\n* The Banner Saga\n* Blackguards\n* Blood Bowl\n* Braid\n* Broforce\n* Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons\n* Castle Crashers\n* C'thulhu Saves the World\n* FTL: Faster Than Light (my favorite PC game, also lead me to Into the Breach)\n* Game Dev Tycoon\n* Gunpoint\n* Hatoful Boyfriend\n* Legend of Grimrock (and Legend of Grimrock 2)\n* Magicka (and Magicka 2)\n* Octodad\n* Orcs Must Die\n* Orcs Must Die 2\n* Papers, Please\n* Pillars of Eternity\n* Retro City Rampage\n* Reus\n* Risk of Rain\n* Rogue Legacy\n* Sanctum\n* Space Run\n* SpaceChem\n* The Stanley Parable\n* Sunless Sea\n* Terraria\n* This War of Mine\n* Transistor\n* Transformers: War for Cybertron\n* Transformers: Fall of Cybertron\n* War for the Overworld\n* and, of course, WARHAMMER 40,000: SPACE MARINE\n\nI'd been preparing for the inevitable whenever the news broke at the start of May. I was sad when I saw this tweet, but after going through my Steam list, it hit me hard. I bought 6 shirts to support him after he broke the news. They're getting hella worn over the next couple of weeks. With E3 just around the corner as well, I'm going to really miss his Snarkathon takes on the press conferences.\n\nI'm not a religious person.

He insisted for years that options matter on a platform that actually needs them, because every gamer is different.\n\nWithout him PC gaming would be worse. We are here, because people like him believed in the idea of choice and that people are rational.\n\nHe always stood for the rights of the consumer. The average young men and women who need to make informed decisions on the ever growing gaming market.\n\nHe put ethics before everything else. His phisophy evolved over the years to be as transparent and concise as possible. Even if his tastes didn't align with ours or vice versa, he always explained his stance, which was valuble. Because both perspectives on a matter yield the utlimate truth.\n\nHe made YouTube a better place for video gaming. Back when he started, gaming wasn't the predominant subject of YouTube. But we all saw that change years ago. Gaming in YouTube is hugely important for the industry as a whole and he did his part to ensure that viewers got a fair deal out of it.\n\nHis ethics and constant search of the best format to critique gaming has insipired many to do it as well.\n\nAnd I'm afraid to say there's a huge audience out there right now craving for honest and concise opinion based content. We will never fill the void that's left, but we can learn and grow.\n\nThis very much reminds of Rayn Davis' passing in 2013. 4 years and 2 months almost. TotalBiscuit followed GiantBomb and covered his passing in his Content Patch series. The passion with which he explained Davis' passing made me shed a tear about a website and a person I didn't follow or even knew about.\n\nIt made me pay attention to GB and eventually become a fan. Which eventually prompted me to start playing a small game called Project Reality where I've found life long friends, all because of a chain reaction caused by TB.\n\nI imagine some people will mourn TBs passing the way I did of Rayn Davis - you still feel the loss even if you didn't really follow TB.\n\nRayn Davis was one of the most charming and nicest people in the industry. He passed away prematurelly at the age of 34, very similar to TB. Taken away waay too soon. Waay before they could both come to their prime.\n\nJust like GB, it feels like TB was just starting his career. Just starting to break the big news, make a wider impact, but looking back, he already did way more than 99.99% of us will ever do.\n\nI think more of us should strive to be like TB. Start from pretty much nothing and just shoot for the stars. A lot of effort will be required, but if you don't try, you can't succeed.\n\nAnd to watch him do all of that while battling cancer to the bitter end, staying positive is perhaps something most of couldn't do at all.\n\nHis critique, commentary, advice and ethics will be missed.\n\nRIP BiscuitBear"}, {"comment_id": "dzj23xh", "post_id": "8lwynt", "comment": "TotalBiscuit put up one hell of a fight since his diagnosis and was goddamn inspiring in the process.

The boom of PC gaming that happened in the early 2010s wouldn't have been the same without TB holding so many people to account and it's a legacy that we still enjoy today.\n \nLate in his channel's lifespan I eventually unsubscribed because I disagreed with how he was running it.

Do people not learn?\n\nEdit: There's more to it, check the discussion below."}, {"comment_id": "f306qim", "post_id": "dexggm", "comment": "High chance that I am way too late to this thread but a word of warning about this *game*. I followed it closely when it was announced just because I thought it had a strong scam vibe behind it. I still don't believe on the longevity of what the dev is offering. A few point in no particular order that I'd like to share:\n\n- This is a Hearthstone clone. If you want more of the same, that'll be this game. The stats of a lot of cards have their counterpart in HS, specially the classic set.\n\n- The game currently have only one card set as far as I know and it has been this way since the game was announced around 1.5 year ago.\n\n- The price, in Ethereum, of the packs have always been fixed but, as you know, its not the case of ETH.\n\n- You can buy different card packs for the single card set. The most costly packs guarantees legendary cards. The price was always fixed at 0.012ETH, 0.075ETH, 0.112ETH and 1ETH **per pack**. At launch, this was equivalent to around $4.80, $30.00, $44.80 and $400 **per pack**. Today the price point is $2.10, $13.13, $19.60 and $175 per pack.\n\n- The dev claims that once a card is sold, it is unique to the blockchain it was sold to and that card can never chance. As in even if the dev decides to balance the card, the version that was sold will never be affected since it is 'in the blockchain' after it is sold. I know I probably butchered that sentence but allow me to make an analogy. Think of buying a pack of card from Hearthstone with your Credit Card. Think of the process. You buy a pack, a unique transaction ID is generated from your bank. What Gods Unchained dev supposedly do is any cards that comes out of that pack of card now have the unique transaction ID imprinted on it. So, in their server, Transaction ID 1234 has Cards X, Y and Z. That's it. People seems to think that, somehow, the transaction ID is now the card since it is easy to convince gullible people it is the case. So, the general belief is that dev will never be able to change a card because it now belongs to the *blockchain* rather than dev holding back from changing the said card *for now*.\n\n- The dev announced a $1.6m tournament at launch. The prize pool is financed by taking a 10% split from all sales of the card packs. Currently the counter is sitting at around $500k. There's no set date, nothing. You just hope that the number displayed on the website is correct and that the dev will honor their promise one day if it ever hit that amount.\n\n- Card packs were sold before there ever was any game. There was literally nothing and the dev was selling card packs. People were buying. Well more like, people were *investing* since most people back then were riding the cryptocurrency craze.\n\n- Naspers, ~~subsidiary of~~ investor in Tencent, invested $15m in this game recently. If you're sleeping under a rock, Tencent is the largest Chinese conglomerate. This bit actually makes the Tweet even more questionable.\n\nFor sure Gods Unchained dev managed to slip just in time for a good exposure by throwing shades at Blizzard but I see people singing the praise of Gods Unchained's dev in here which makes me wonder whether people are even aware what the hell they're even praising in the first place.\n\nEdit: Ugh of course this is sitting at -4 for no apparent reason/post contradicting anything I said.

At the time the UK was spearheading regulation for the EU. Now that the UK is in flux, it looks like the EU is leaving it up to Belgium to take this on. The EU will ban this content, certain large Western companies will try to find ways around it, and the EU will not mess around. They will sanction. \n\n>If you are a regular reader here at Gamasutra, then you've known this was coming for years. Major companies (that don't seem to follow the news) have been acquiring labor assets and equipment to optimize their gambling operations and that means they are going to be even slower to adapt to the changing environment. Sure, your virtual world was a lucrative place to drop a casino, but there are children in your games unless you want to make your games adult only, which I don't know of any gaming company that wants to do that. \n\n>On a personal note, I'm kinda looking forward to playing games again, without having to walk through a casino to get to them.\n\n>The specific game I showed regulators in 2013 at the ICPEN summit was Marvel Super Hero Squad Online, a game made for Disney by Gazillion Entertainment, with overt gambling mechanics (including a roulette wheel) aimed at very young children that may not even be of reading age. As I hinted at last week, I suspect someone tipped Disney off to this ruling in advance and the Disney/Gazillion breakup was damage control, four years late.\n\n>If you look at the link to the VTM article, you will see that European parents are waking up to news reports showing Star Wars Battlefront 2 (with some amazing animation btw) along with the included gambling mechanics and interviews with regulators. This is an amazing amount of free advertising for both Disney and EA, but not the kind they want. This must be catastrophic news for both companies and (as I've been hinting this year) I think you will see that the financial forecasts for both companies were optimistic because they did not anticipate this happening despite it being four years in the making.\n\n>This bewilders me since when I gave my report to the ICPEN in Panama in 2013, the vice president of Disney was sitting three feet from me. I had dinner with her the previous evening. As soon as she was done with her presentation calling for \"industry self-regulation\" (and we can see clearly what that means) the German chief regulator started asking her why there were gambling mechanics in her products for young children and she fled the conference immediately. The writing was on the wall, I don't understand why they waited for the EU to torpedo their product line and brand image.\n\n>When I got back to the USA after the ICPEN summit, I was asked to present at GDC 2014. I was double approved for a talk on children's monetization, the ICPEN summit, and pending regulation. A panel on monetization ethics that I was on was also double approved. Then at the last moment both were cancelled without explanation. People keep asking me why I don't talk at GDC, and this is why. The gaming industry correction I have been warning of is about to double down, but it didn't have to be this way. Even games without gambling mechanics will be affected as parents, media, and legislators begin to demonize our industry and make alternate purchase decisions.\n\nI love how the Disney lady scurried away from the conference after being asked about giving gambling access, already back 2013.

I may be bad at capturing the specifics, but [this article](https://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/2014/03/addiction-art-how-gambling-machines-and-digital-world-put-us-machine-zone), and the subsequent book by  Natasha Dow Sch\u00fcll , *\"Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas\"*, should be some required reading for gamers to understand why lootboxes are not the same as whatever popular \"What about...?\" they want to compare them towards.  Or some irrational fear that this is a first amendment assault on games (it's not). \n\nWhat is happening is the slow maturation of modern behavioral sciences, developed deeply for addiction by gambling industries, making their way into game technology *because they work and are incredibly effective.*  This isn't knee jerk feels, such as the scare that violent media causes violent delinquency, proven wrong for every media yet available (... how about round 14 for VR?), but based on legitimate science being deployed in gambling industry. \n\nWhen we have upfront companies advertising their services to turn *\"players into payers,\"* they're not selling snake oil, but effective practices that will work on more than just \"weak will addicts,\" and completely overwhelm anyone's self sense of personal will or responsibility; we are all mortal and fallible. \n\nLong gone are the \"crank the handle, win or lose\" of slot design.  Modern design includes constant feedback/reward, learned algorithms to evoke engagement, and \"free spins\" at the opportune rate/time to keep you in among many things.  Video games already have engagement covered, you're paying to be there for retail releases.  The other two are built into how most lootbox platforms, even the seemingly safe ones like Overwatch, to not cause outrage or fuss, but to lull you into thinking they're safe, enjoyable, and fun.  Because that's how they're designed, but at some point, either sooner or later for all but the most determined players, you will be caught at a weaker will moment ([willpower is not unlimited](https://www.wired.com/2012/10/mf-willpower/)), and you will pay. \n\nThese mechanics are not good for anyone.  They have very scary and real concerns should they break into other areas of e-commerce, but in video games alone, they're cause for concern.  We should not allow them to be in front of minors and we should be educating adults on why some of us are so \"butthurt\" about the topic. \n\nWhile some want a full ban, most of use wanted the video game industry to self-regulate from the start.  A push for the ESRB would be great, but that didn't happen.  So now we're contacting our legislators on the matter and it's gaining momentum slowly.  This may push the market to self-regulate, much like the maligned fears over violence years ago, which is a win-win for all.  However, if they do not effectively self-regulate with transparency, then we need to do something and not just sit around.  I care about gaming and games in general, in a wide spectrum.  I don't want them to become something more toxic just for the increase quarterly revenue for major publishers who give two shits less about the medium as art or entertainment, just profits.

Importing content was slow, and didn't scale. Rebuilds sometimes took tens of minutes to complete. Some features were poorly implemented or half-assed due to developers not wanting to wait for dependencies, which led to low performance of those features.\n\nBasically, Bungie didn't get a proper plan in place for how to structure their development and allocate their resources quickly enough, and paid the price with a slightly dodgy engine that from a consumer point of view performs very well, but from a developer point of view is an absolute nightmare to work with.\n\nTheir overall development time for the engine was far slower than intended, and that combined with the low-performance of certain development tools had a knock-on effect that impacted the rest of Destiny *and* Destiny 2's development. It also meant that creating new content was a painfully slow process, because it would mean importing new assets (low-performance feature that never scaled properly) and testing new builds (which take an age to complete). This is what they mean by \"It was too hard to create new content and we just couldn't do it anymore\".\n\nAll this meant they ran out of money because everything went over schedule, so in order to reach Activision's lofty revenue goals and release schedule, they renegotiated to put out smaller content packages and added microtransactions to generate an additional revenue stream. Apparently, even that wasn't enough, because Activision still said that all of Destiny's sales, even Forsaken, which was their best-selling expansion and almost sold as well as the base game, weren't good enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarise, if Bungie had properly planned out their engine development, there wouldn't be microtransactions in Destiny and the games would have had significantly more content, because the engine would have been more feature-rich, far easier to work with and have drastically reduced development times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, is Bungie at fault? Yes. Is Activision at fault? To a lesser extent, also yes. But not out of some kind of evil intent. It was simply because going into this whole arrangement nobody had any idea everything would go quite so wrong. Hopefully, if they are working on some kind of mobile game with the money from NetEase, it'll give them the time they need to sort out their engine, and by the time we get their next game, be it Destiny 3 or a new IP, they'll be in a much better position to put out some good quality games.\n\nI wouldn't hold out much hope of Destiny 2 changing anytime soon though.

Doctors think they've got 1-6 months left.\n\nFor me with one of my family members, it's been 5 years now. 5 years after the initial doctor statement that they think he has a couple weeks to 3 months left. His cancer is god awful, it's spread through his entire body and the doctors don't even see a point in trying to operate on any of it. Yet he's surviving. I'm thankful I got to spend all of the time I did and I'm thankful he got to adjust and accept life with cancer. But this shit is depressing. 5 years of constantly wondering if today is the day they go into the hospital for the final time, with only a couple days left to live. 5 years of spending every free moment with them, worried it's the last time you'll see them. That awkward and guilty feeling of taking a day off from work for just yourself, and not going to see them. That other awkward and guilty feeling of not seeing them for a few months because you are busy with life and have stuff to do, all the while knowing you aren't seeing them when they could be dead tomorrow. You want to move on but can't. \n\nIt's a state of permeant limbo. The pain is less than death, but it never stops. It's a slow torture. When that person dies and you can finally grieve for real, it's not long before you remember that another family member is still battling cancer.\n\nFuck cancer."}, {"comment_id": "dxmcgp7", "post_id": "8ddbjo", "comment": "Man this sucks.

I was off in the big city and had finally found a decent job. I quit and moved back in with him and my mother to help. He started with chemo and moved on to radiation. I took him 60 mile round trips to get both treatments nearly every day. Eventually his kidneys failed and that was another 60 mile round trip for dialysis. With the cancer being in his spine it was a constant pain on every drive. Every little bump was painful and a lot of the trip was down dirt roads. This went on for 6 months with his body weakening and mind gradually going. He couldn't remember who we were after a while. The doctors recommended we put him in hospice and essentially we had him euthanized. They just kept raising his meds until his body couldn't take any more. During the last days my relatives talked about God and how great he is. I couldn't take that and cut all ties with my half brother and everyone and we haven't talked in years.

A nice example is Diablo 3. Blizzard made Diablo 2, so they had plenty of experience, right? Well, no. The dev team behind D3 had basically nothing to do with D2. That's why they missed so hard on what is important in an ARPG/H&S game. A lot of the changes RoS made, were actually community ideas, so Blizzard took a lot of time and effort into reading what the community wants after that horrible release, because they realized they had no clue what Diablo is about.\n\nEA bought Titanfall developer Respawn.

While this is speculation, this was their big reveal and any marketing wizard worth his weight was careful in what they included.\n\nFirst off: Most scenes in the video show your average game. That 30 year old dude or gal playing. It shows Skyrim (?). That, to me, is a hint that Nintendo wants to cater to third party developers and mature audiences.\n\nSecond thing is they don't really show children or older adults in it. Nintendo has always gone for accesibility, I found it strange they didn't include the whole demographic range they wish to appeal to. \n\nThird, and perhaps most surprising, is the e-sports arena. Even if you don't care much for competitice gaming, this is BIG. Catering to competitive gamers means they need amazing online tools, great feedback by devs and very technical games. Nintendo is infamous for having bad online platforms. If their venture into e-sports is to be believed, that could change. This means amazing Matchmaker, easy friend lists, tight customizability for thoae games.\n\nLast, but not least, they keep showing a social setting. Constantly. They want you to go out and play. This means games could be designed around this. Think Pokemon Go and Streetpass on steroids.\n\nAnd the best thing is this is all apart from the console itself, which looks compact, looks ergonomic and from the looks of it, very well thought of to the smallest detail.\n\nStill a lot to see, still a lot to know, but this was a good reveal! I'm glad Nintendo is still good old Nintendo."}, {"comment_id": "d90bont", "post_id": "58gz2p", "comment": "Skyrim seems like kind of a weird game to showcase.

So the base station can help offset that.\n\nOther than a place to sit the Switch when on TV play, there's no reason to have a base station that large, unless it has some extra power inside it.  Don't need all that plastic to stand up a screen, or supply power to it.  \n\nEDIT: Another thought.  That base station has a fairly thin piece of plastic that covers the screen of the switch when docked.  If it's a simple cradle that can only charge the unit, there is ZERO reason to cover the screen, as people would want to use it as a cradle, and play the system with it in the cradle.  \n\nEDIT #2: The cradle has two ports on the left side of it.  Can't tell what type of ports they are though. Can't tell if they are USB, or something else.  I'm assuming USB, so you can connect the more standard controller to it, to charge it.\n\nEdit to my Edits....Where the hell did my 3rd edit go?  \n\nedit edit edit : Dammit reddit!! what is with the editing system?  This is the first time I've really tried to do multiple edits on a post, but damn.  I just want to update my post with more information.  \n\nHopefully this part shows up. :  That thin bit of plastic thats on the front of the base station is odd.  It covers the screen of the console.  There's no reason to do that, if the base station was a simple cradle with power.  To me it says two things \n\n1 - When docked, This is for the TV-only.  No dual screen. \n\n2 - When docked, you cannot use a wireless controller, and play using the consoles screen.  \n\nSo when docked, it doesn't output video to the screen AT ALL.  \n\nALSO: The back of that base station looks pretty thick.  at least 2x thicker than the handheld unit itself.  There's no reason to make it that thick, unless there is something back there.  And the only thing that makes sense is extra CPU / GPU Power, and maybe RAM.   It doesn't need to have a battery, as it would be plugged into the wall.  And you don't need that much space to supply power to the unit, and a couple controllers.  \n\nALSO #2 : Doesn't appear to be a touch screen.  In the video, Not once does anyone actually touch the screen.   In my opinion, this is great.  Will create a much more standard control scheme for games, also simplifies the controls when docked.  You can't see, much less touch the screen when docked, So when in TV mode, you can't use touch controls anyways.  \n\nLooks like they are moving farther and farther away from the Wii-U model, which is great.  Also, looks like there won't be backwards compatibility, as many Wii-U games either need the touch screen, A 2nd screen, or both.  Which in my opinion, is also great.

Yeah it will likely be a bit more user friendly by than, but at its core it will still be a pay to win concept and they will still have the title designed around making it a must have. \n\nAlso, its interesting how fast people jump on news like that seeing it as a win.

You were a brave man, who brought some of the best memories to many people. You helped with many of the most recognizable games ever made like Mario to Zelda, to smaller titles that people still love to this very day, and will never forget the smiles and tears that they earned through playing. Through Animal Crossing you gave people a second life, a life that they enjoyed, a life that they loved, a life that they even mourned if they were to ever abandon it. But, if there was one thing I will never forget about you as a person, it\u2019s your eternal optimism. You never gave up on the Wii U, no matter how grim it\u2019s situation seemed, no matter how much people made fun of it and scoffed at it. You cared for Nintendo\u2019s consoles with pride, which is more than what I can say for many people, who would drop things in an instant. Because of this, we have some of the most memorable Nintendo games yet, like Bayonetta, W101, Splatoon, and even the Smash game that made history, bringing the greatest gaming icons ever in one place. You believed in Nintendo unlike anything ever seen before, and you earned the respect of many for it.\n\nIwata, you paved the future for Nintendo, and now it\u2019s time for them to keep moving foward, brighter than ever into the unknown. Only by doing so will your legacy live on. As long as Nintendo stands, you along with everyone else before you, will never be forgotten, so long as Nintendo never forgets that, above all else, they want to make the world a better place, by bringing joy through gaming, by bringing people together through them, and making memories people wouldn\u2019t trade for the world.\n\nAnd so, I end this with a quote from Splatoon:\n\n\u201cWhy are we here? For what purpose do we exist? We must not dwell on these questions. We can merely trust in the will of the universe and spend our days and nights in harmony with the world, celebrating this festival called Life.\u201d\n\nSo before we go back our festival of life, let\u2019s have a moment of silence for the people that made it more enjoyable.

Faalskar took 2000 hours from a single guy, with the free help of many, many people. Eliminate that free help ('cause now you're charging, people gotta get paid), we can be looking at 2500 hours. Let's take a wage of 10$ an hour, so to make up for that, you'd need to make 25k. So that means you must sell for 1,000,00$ of your mod to make up for the time you invested@ 10$ each, that's 10k sales, and we're talking about one the most efficiently made and high quality mod, done by an actual programmer.

I have had very few real reasons to be this disappointed in Valve since I started using Steam way back when, but this was definitely something I was very against, and not because of the specific idea of rewarding hard work. \n\nIn the hopes that someone from Valve will see this eventually: \n\nMods have always been a collaborative effort. Some moreso than others obviously, but there are few mods out there that work to do something amazing in a vacuum. Often times specific tools are used to create an effect, or assets are used from another mod to improve the look of an area, or many other interconnections that need to be there simply by nature of the fact that no one person can do much of this stuff. \n\nMy point is, let's say we start a similar system with a blank slate for TES VI:\n\nFirst, someone creates a great scripting tool (in this iteration it was SKSE) which is practically required for many mods to do many things in a way that doesn't crash the game. The author of that wants to sell it. That's fine of course, he/she has created a useful tool right? \n\nBut then the artists start creating assets. Art is often one thing that's extremely hard to come by to create a good mod. You can use the base assets in the game, but you want your mod to stand out, so you probably want to use a bunch of those. Of course the artist wants to get paid for their work so they monetize their work. \n\nFinally you come down to the lowly programmer/modder, who really can't do the other two things, so what happens? Well, this person has to shell out for however many tools, assets and other mods they want to incorporate into their new mod. Suddenly, they have to shell out just to *start* a project they may or may not have the time, passion or ability to finish. At this point the modding scene is both diluted and stifled to the point that half the potential modders just say fuck it and give up. \n\nThe others pass their costs on to the consumer, which end up making major overhauls cost probably about as much as the original game and that's even thinking of maybe 50 cents per asset/tool. And that's if they don't just sell it without all that stuff  and require the end user to download it all, paying separately for each bit. \n\nThis is just one scenario I thought up in the past few days that would both destroy the vibrant mod communities we have all come to know and be amazed by, at least as they are now, and likely kill many people's gaming budgets just for the love of one game. I hope this sort of thing is at least taken under consideration when working on version 2.0 of this pay for mods idea...\n\nP.S. As Jim Sterling said in his most recent Jimqusition episode, a pay-what-you-want model is likely the best way to approach this. People can support those they can with what they can without having to break the bank, and mod authors will still get access to what they need to create and a system that would allow people to give monetary support for great mods.\n\ntl;dr - Assuming a fresh start where everyone has to use the pay system, the tools and assets that go into mods would raise the price of mods that rely on them to the point of making it cost prohibitive to either start to create or buy mods at all.

Where Valve fucked up was implementation not the idea.  The percent cut of who gets paid what isn't the problem either.\n\nThe significant hurdle involved placing themselves in a curator role, a role which the company has attempted to not become.  The first Skyrim paid mods simply weren't good.  People might buy them to see what is going on, but they were terrible and not really in the mindset of what the paid mod plan was setting out to do.  The issue also involved placing Valve in the position of controlling who puts what on the paid mod section.  This involves both ensuring that those who put up paid mods are the ones who actually created them, but also ensuring that these third parties were using other copyright material.  Pretty sure Disney wouldn't be happy about a mod of Mickey Mouse running around killing dragons by shouting dildos at them.\n\nFor as much as people complained about the cost or the split going to which party, those arguments aren't really valid.  If Bethesda is going to take X% of the sale of a mod, then they can.  The modder is ultimately using their material to make the mod.  Bethesda owns it and that's how copyright law works.  Valve went out and basically made an agreement that Bethesda would tolerate to push some money to the modder.  This is an irrelevant point to argue since it was most likely not Valve's number and for the modder is option is 100% of zero or 25% of something?\n\nThere are issues about how mods would grow that are worth having.  How well would large conversion mods grow if you have to buy in before anyone really knows if they work?  This type of development of the mod is a useful debate to have.  Becoming enraged without any direction is insulting to everyone else involved.  I disliked this entire event because I saw far to many arguments against paid mods that either made no sense whatsoever or were incredibly counter-intuitive.\n\nThe line from the Gabe post that really made me wonder if many of these people were sane was his comment that he treats money as information and people just started railing into him for being rich.  Money is information.  Businesses follow the money to determine what the market wants.  This had nothing to do with himself, but how the company operates.  The point was to state that if these mods actually saw revenue flow, it would help identify areas where valve can put resources to improve the quality of the product or increase its exposure.

Far too often we see companies ship garbage and then just say \"meh, fuck it, deal with it\".

If you want to support modders like you claim you do, then start by actually paying them for their work. There's no logical reason why the modders should only receive 25% of the income for 100% of the work.\n\nIf you want to see a rise in the quality of mods, start with some quality control. There was absolutely no way to tell if the mod you were buying was stolen. There's no way to tell what mods it does or doesn't work with. There's no incentive to make all mods work together, and no tools to help the user do that themselves. There was also no guarantee that the person you just paid would continue supporting that mod at all. 24 hours is hardly enough time to ensure that a mod has no bugs and will get continued support after purchase.\n\nHave some criteria. Joe Blow shouldn't be able to just swing on in and upload a paid mod. Modders should have to achieve some sort of trusted status before their mods can be monetized. Have them submit X amount of mods that all receive a positive rating or something. \n\nI like the Idea of paid/donate/pay what you want mods. Some people have this ridiculous sense of entitlement about the whole thing and seem to think that free mods are their birth right and there's no way in hell someone should be able to spend hours on something and then charge them for it, no fucking way, that would be ridiculous. \n\nTL;DR\n\nI think it's a great idea if we take time to ensure that : \n\n+ Modders are getting paid for their work, not the devs.\n+ Mods meet some standard of quality\n+ Modders meet some criteria before posting paid mods.\n\nThat way modders have incentive to do good work and consumers know they're getting a quality product. Again, nobody's forcing you to buy these paid mods, but nobody is forcing anyone to upload them either.

This is just a collection of various thoughts I've had on this topic for a while, and there'll be less appropriate threads to put this in unless I do it now.\n\nBefore we go into the ethics and mechanics of paid mods - I think it's important to consider a deeper question: Why do modders mod games?\n\nThere's actually an even deeper question here - why do we have hobbies?  Or, rather, why do we do something for free, usually in our spare time?  On a pure financial level, a hobby like modding makes no sense.  The time spent decompiling that encrypted binary so the protagonist has larger genitals could be better-spent running your own business, or learning something to enhance your knowledge, or something - something that will have a payoff.  So why do we do it?  Well, like all hobbies, we do them because it is fun.  Because it makes us happy.  Because we find it motivating.  Money is not a factor at all.  At best, it enhances our portfolio or CV, which we can indirectly use to earn more money.  But many of us don't even work in IT, or graphics jobs, etc. - so it's not always clear-cut.\n\nIn a lot of ways, mods ignore everything financial.  Mods don't necessarily gyrate towards the best-selling games - this is why we see mods for old games, for games that don't sell any more, or even mods for [some of the worst games of all time](http://www.yourewinner.com/index.php?topic=110.0).  Mods don't care about the free market, because everything is free.  Mods have an upfront cost - the cost of running your PC, and buying tools (like IDEs) to build the mod itself - but have zero payoff.\n\nTo me, there is a broad, simple conclusion for the vast majority of cases - modding cannot be reasonably justified in terms of money.  It makes no sense, in the same way that jogging cannot be reasonably justified in terms of money.\n\nI feel there are, however, many huge benefits to modding being free, that simply vanish when mandatory costs come into play.  It's not linear or smooth - it's a stepwise function that jumps up the moment it goes above zero.\n\n- Small mods are appreciated.  Simple things, like basic skins, are viable.  We don't need to necessarily hunt-down giant content packs to get best value-for-money.  If you want 100 new outfits, you can get 50 from a pack and 50 others as single addons if you so desired.\n- It encourages reuse of other mods.  This is a lot like free (as in speech, not beer) software - being able to use any software with a compatible license with minimal barriers (usually just a credit and licensing notice).  Many games have established mods that are considered blueprints for other mods, or even just outright dependencies.  By encouraging reuse, it means nobody has to reinvent the wheel, which makes the modding \"universe\" more efficient.\n- The only arbiter of mods is quality.  You never need to consider buying a more expensive mod to get better features, or whether to go with the free version with lesser features.  It's like capitalism, but replacing money with quality.  Without the money question, modders never need to consider things like whether a feature provides value-for-money to them.\n- Experimentation is encouraged.  Many mods seem interesting and we can try them out.  This in turn sparks discussion about the mod - what it does well, what it doesn badly, etc. - which feeds back into the mod ecosystem - the mod might be improved, or someone might create their own version.  With money, we have to be extra-cautious - even if it's cheap.  It could even steer us towards expensive, proven mods, whose modders have deeper pockets and leaves the smaller modders behind.\n- I'm fearful a \"microtransaction\" approach towards modding will result in the nuclear wasteland that is a mobile app store - where the most-popular mods are not the best ones, but the ones that provide Valve and/or the publishers with the greatest profit.  Mods will be developed with the basic idea that click-baity mods that have broad appeal, with minimal effort, will have the greatest payoff.  Why spend months developing a Lord of the Rings total conversion mod that sells for $5 when you can write a fishing mod in hours that costs $0.50?  Do we trust Valve enough to do the correct thing in our minds - to protect the \"modding ecosystem\" - over its own profits?\n\n**So what do modders deserve?**\n\nModders have functioned without compensation for a while now.  Has something changed in recent years that justifies a change?  Should we, as gamers, be compensating the modders, or should Bethesda, say (for their products) be doing it?  How about Valve?  Is it a combination of the three?\n\nIf we take a step back for a second - how do we reward modders right now?  Remember, as a hobby, money has not been *the* answer since forever.  I'm a software developer and I personally am happy when people use code I've written personally or have helped write.  A lot of it is simply the mere usage of it - praise is a bonus.  Critique too is fine - it proves someone cares enough to use my software and wants it improved.  For modders, simple \"thank you!\" posts or even just Reddit karma or retweets would also count.  I think there is a genuine question here to be answered by all of us whether this is truly enough - whether we appreciate modders enough - and if not, how could we?\n\nI also wonder whether this is a modern-day phenomenon.  We see this with the likes of Twitch streamers and donations, or YouTube personalities who get compensated directly or indirectly - the Internet know lets us make money online easily, and you no longer need to be a million-dollar company with a SEO-friendly URL.  10-20 years ago, some form of compensation would have felt weird for modders, but it feels less weird now - the proposed 25% cut being unfair a case in point.\n\nWhether or not modders are compensated, however, I still feel it's important to for modders to consider that it's entirely possible that their success and fame is partially-down to the fact that mods are free, for reasons I've described above and where others have stated in many places.  If you were compensated up front in the past, it's entirely possible the modding ecosystem would not be as good as it were today (although you would be richer) - and perhaps selfishly, we care less about your bank account than the modding ecosystem.\n\nThis statement by Valve, to me, suggests they favour the former, rather than the latter, and that is troubling.  Modding makes PC gaming great - and Valve has made a living of mods converted into games.  I fear Valve will now end up with \"mod-lite\" games where only a select few can really make great mods that are endorsed, but the rest of the Workshop is full of amateurish, rubbish efforts - effectively rewarding great modders who \"made it\" today - but killing off tomorrow's great modders.\n\n**The dependency question**\n\nLeaving aside the paid mod issue, one thing I've realised is that if, say, mod X depends on mod Y, and mod X has donations, surely, ethically, a portion should go to mod Y?  I wonder whether this motivated the SkyUI modder's reaction - as a mod that is key to many mods on Skyrim, has SkyUI itself garnered enough kudos, be it financial or motivational?  For SkyUI, this is less of a problem because SkyUI itself is a mod that adds value.  A mod that works in the background, as a \"framework\", that does nothing by itself, is more of an interesting question.\n\nWe also need to consider transitive dependencies - i.e. mod X depends on mod Y which depends on mod Z.\n\nPaid mods could have an impact here, too, and not necessarily in a good way.  For argument's sake, let's say downstream mods get a comparative cut which diminishes as the number of hops increases (say 10% goes to immediate dependencies, and 1% to the next level, and 0.1% to the level after, etc.).  I think several things could happen:\n\n- Modders won't declare their dependencies, so they get more money\n- Modders will actively try to reduce their dependencies (to increase their cut) by reinventing the wheel, which is wasted effort when you consider the big picture\n\nHow would we reward \"downstream\" modders is a question I think we need to explore further.

But I feel, if done correctly, could very well be something that adds to the community instead of tearing it apart.\n\nIf you are going to treat it like TF2 items, then you must do so in more then just the payment split of 25% to the modder. You (Valve and/or the developers) should hand pick and curate the items. You should be responsible for fixing them if something breaks in an update. You should release them in bundles. You should be doing much more.\n\nHowever if you want to be completely hands off as you were, leave all updates and fixes to the modder, have the community curate and moderate the marketplace content themselves, and claim ownership over the mod content you are not deserving of even a 10% cut. Taking 75% for doing so little is an insult, pure and simple.\n\nBut if the developer wants to be that hands off, they can settle for a donation system where the modder gets 90-95% and you guys can split the rest. Otherwise we will just stick to the Nexus because you want to take far too much for doing too little."}, {"comment_id": "cqqwlhf", "post_id": "3435tu", "comment": "I think there's two camps when it comes to the \"paid modding\" concept. The optimists and the pessimists. I try to be optimistic in all things, but after the gaming industry has burned me in so many ways, I just can't trust them to do the right thing anymore.\n\nI posted this in another thread about the same issue, but I think it's relevant here. \n\n>I don't trust Valve to handle this well, when they already have a horrible refund policy, and have an F in customer service. Why should we think they're suddenly going to get better? What happens when the 24 hour refund period is up? **Mods can break months after you download them**, and it's often impossible to prove which mod broke what. What happens when the game is updated and my mods no longer work? Whose responsibility is it to fix that or give me a refund? The developer whose getting the majority of the money? Or the author? How is this enforced?\n\n>With this policy, some of my mods used to be free and now I can never update them without paying. It also undermines the idea that \"we can easily avoid these paid mods\" like so many have been saying.\n\n>**I don't** believe that there will still be a large amount of high quality free mods, since my mods are already behind a paywall now.\n\n>**I don't** think small mods will be free, because the majority of paid mods on the workshop are armor and weapon packs that were free a week ago.\n\n>**I don't** think I will easily be able to avoid paid mods, especially when so many mods require other mods to work, and especially when, again, so many of my most favorite mods are now behind paywalls.\n\n>**I don't** think Valve will handle any of this well.\n\n>**I do** think that developers will exploit this, especially bethesda, which already stops patching its games because modders will fix their bugs for them. Well what's gonna happen when Bethesda is now getting PAID for modders to fix their game?\n\n>**I do** think that this will hurt the modding community as a whole, turning what was a bunch of hobbyists sharing content and combining projects in order to enhance games into a confusing, financial and legal nightmare where no one knows what can and can't be used, mods that allow other mods to work will be behind paywalls, and compilation mods that are combinations of dozens of mods will be riddled with purchases and paywalls in order to function properly.\n\n>**I hope** the optimists are right. I really do, but the gaming industry has burned me before, and nothing is going to convince me that paying bethesda and valve (oh and a tiny fraction to the modder) for the best mods, or even simple armor packs, is better for the consumer or more convenient than getting them for free."}, {"comment_id": "cqqx0i2", "post_id": "3435tu", "comment": "I'm sorry everyone piled up on you guys Erik :C I thought it was a fundamentally good idea, just poorly implemented. \n\nI hope you guys keep on the good work and won't be too disappointed in the community.

Both for those who got incredibly aggressive about it, and those who failed to see why it annoyed so many of us. I think the idea can work, but with the implementation of a donation button, with money being shared at a more fair rate. Valve and Bethesda should get some money, both for hosting the mod, and for providing the platform on which to apply it. But to take more than 50% just seemed selfish, as the mod creator is still creating an original work, and putting their time and effort into creating this new experience for others to enjoy. Maybe if a mod added a significant amount to a game, and took a lot of effort on the creators part to create it, then I could see maybe allowing a mod creator to charge, but allowing someone to charge for something as small as a reskin, or small cosmetic changes? That just seems dumb to me. SkyUI? Certainly. I could see why he would want money for that. But someone making people look like they are wearing more/less clothes? That would just encourage low level shitty mods designed to turn out a profit, and it would turn the Steam Workshop into a wasteland of people trying to gain money for something they put no effort into."}, {"comment_id": "cqqtg3p", "post_id": "3435tu", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "eqjw877", "post_id": "byolcb", "comment": "April 16 2020, seems pretty reasonable. \n\nYou have to give CDPR credit, they know how to market their games."}, {"comment_id": "eqjv9h4", "post_id": "byolcb", "comment": "What the fuck?!

Yes, yes, we know \u2014 for now, the demo is only available to the lucky ones who managed to get tickets to E3 and the rest of you will have to wait until gamescom or the public dev Q&A unveiling stream at PAX in August. Yeah, we can already feel the bashing you're gonna give us online :(. \"Why are you not treating us fair\", \"why is the gameplay not being released right away?\". The reason is we want to make the most out of the months of work we put into the demo and first showcase gameplay live at E3 and gamescom. Releasing gameplay right away would make the gamescom presentations pointless and would significantly limit our chance to build hype. Why do we need to build hype? To get more gamers interested in CP2077 and, hopefully, convince them to give it a go. We are putting our hearts and souls into making CP2077 a great game and we would like as many gamers as possible to find out about it and experience its amazing story. Also, hype can turn into sales (after all, we are not a charity), and good sales allow us to grow, take creative risks and deliver new, great games for you to enjoy.\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about one more super important announcement \u2014 the release date. Less than a year from now, on April 16th, 2020, you\u2019ll finally be able to sink your teeth into Cyberpunk 2077.\n\nAs you probably noticed, we prepared 2 editions of the game. Why only two? Because when we pre-order ourselves, we don\u2019t like to go to Wikipedia to compare content. We have a simple deal: there\u2019s the standard edition, the one we think most gamers will choose, and a limited Collector\u2019s Edition. While we're pretty proud of the CE, we'd like to turn your attention to that first one. Why? Because we have really maxed out the physical capacity of the box with goodies. We think this raises the bar for \"standard\" and we hope you'll think so, too. Also, since pre-orders are live, you might be wondering if there\u2019s any point in placing an order now. Yes, if you want to give us some extra support. Pre-orders help us build anticipation \u2014 the more copies you pre-order, the more likely it is for us to get retail (both digital and physical) behind the game. Therefore, if you like what you see, we will appreciate you \"voting yes\" for CP2077 with a pre-order. If you are still hesitating though, we would rather you wait for more materials or reviews. Our goal is for you to truly enjoy CP2077 and not regret a pre-order.\n\nTake care and looking forward to seeing you in Night City!

DOOM's multiplayer wasn't *bad*, but what could we have gotten *instead* of that lukewarm multiplayer mode?\n\nIf you have a narrative-focused, single-player game and don't have any intention of putting in multiplayer (whether co-op or competitive), but don't feel like extra effort on the existing single-player would make much of a difference... know what I'd love?  Fucking Mercenaries mode.

If the game is accessible to modders (particularly if the tools are simple to learn even for \"non-modders\"), then it *doesn't matter* if the player thinks something could've done better... because they can fix it themselves.  Probably 80% of my playtime in XCOM2 is with mods, many of them homemade (the layout of the game files is simple enough that you can do quite a lot even without installing ModBuddy) and the lack of mods or accessibility for modding is probably the only big knock I have with this year's Prey."}, {"comment_id": "doszm4j", "post_id": "78cswl", "comment": "EA: \u201cBut how will you get $15,000 from one or two whales?\u201d"}, {"comment_id": "dotc3ly", "post_id": "78cswl", "comment": "I mean, plenty of good story based shooters have multiplayer.

The problems we encountered and why i left, were EXACTLY what NMS looks like at launch: desolate planets and in the end, to make it a game, you have to skip the fact that universe i really, really boring.\n\nOn travelling times between solar systems. I don't buy it one second that he doesn't know. This is essential piece of game mechanics. To make such a game to be a Game, you need to first decrease all distances. Everything starts to revolve on travelling times. Anything short of lightspeed, takes months to travel outside the solar system effect, at least. At light speed it is years to reach solar systems. FTL, faster than light, it still takes arbitrary amount but since we are bending physics, we get the game out of this.\n\nSo, in the end, you will have google planets but the game area is actually just basic DayZ map size, when it  comes to game mechanics. Forget the space ships etc, just focus on the player, what he ACTUALLY does, not what he does in that virtual universe. What actions he takes, in what pace etc, basic game telemetry.\n\nIt.\nCan. \nNot.\nWork.\n\nI mean it, forget infinite universe games as they are NOT games but simply 99,99999999% empty and to make what you, gamer wants, means yo will spend next 20 years travelling to a maybe an empty planet..\n\nAlso multiplayer: absolutely impossible on FFT based seeding. We do not have shared, synced time but even you, as single player are in different time than the planets and stars in the sky.. Several hundreds of thousands of years. It is procedural so each and every change player makes ot a PERSISTENT universe (keyword here) has to be defined as either new rule or excepetion. New rules can not be complex and propagating this new rule to ALL players is impossible. We are already knee deep in paradoxes before we even are starting took for actually two players on same UNIVERSE. This is the kicker, none of the player in NMS are in same universe. They are within same dataspace. HUGE difference. Players create new content while moving in space (there is nothing until you visit the place in person) and it will get more complex in time, but not in the factor needed. We need several hundred times more complexity. 100 choices on 100 million planets or 5 in 18 quintiollion. Look at the resources.. If this was universe simulator, you could not live on 99,9999999999999999999999999% of planets. most of the universe is not a place for you.. Is any planet in NMS illegal or able to kill you immediately, before even setting your foot on the ground? yup, it is impossible problem.\n\nWhat can we do? We can build larger but we can not shortcut but have to bloody do the work. We can do millions of solar systems persistent. We can have limited unlimited, where simply the vast distances of space HAVE to be accepted by gamers and it is possible to fill in theory but will never happen in reality. You will have edge of space anyone can basically visit. It is still about factor of 6 smaller than NMS, if not more. Let's say you got one earth sized PLANET that is persistent, that holds about 100 million players. Within reason. 18 quintillion with almost infinite variance? We are about 24 digits short. These things growfreaking fast, one change in the beginning may mean hundreds of petabytes of difference. The only way how is to put big boys on it and spend hundreds of millions into research. About a decade before NMS really can exist.. It is so close, we already know how to do it but, we can not make it work inside our resources. We can do nanometer to observable universe.

It was also really small, and the letter opener sword was flimsy and probably broke shortly after he got home with it. \n\nThe entire time he kept on about how cool it was. \n\nI don't know if it's protection from buyers remorse, but it had to be one of the cringiest things I sat through.

Many people seem to have this need to spend ridiculous amounts of money on garbage. I feel like these are kids who never got over having toys as a kid and became dependent on them. \n\nAlso the fallacy that somehow these things would be worth more money in the future is only true if the collectors edition was desired for and was actually kept in the box. 99 percent of the time these people don't so I don't understand what they expect.

Now I don't know how much the figurines and helmet cost together or individually, but even if it does all add up to the full amount, well that's the full amount including markup (some fairly generous markup I might add), and we've still managed to include a canvas bag, *and* that's without providing any discounts on account of the fact that this is a collector's edition bundle and there's probably at least a bit of a saving to be made. ***And*** that's UK pricing for everything, and it *still* lines up pretty well, meaning it easily lines up in USD($) where everything's generally cheaper.\n\nI just can't see any scenario where they *can't* put canvas bags in the Power Armour editions, even if they bought them one at a time off of Amazon from 3rd party sellers.\n\nIn fact, the only scenario that makes sense to me is that at the last minute, a high up of some kind made the decision to increase profit margins by swapping out the canvas bag for a nylon one, which was clearly a dumb idea and *too* last minute since they already had marketing material with the canvas bag in. Did they think nobody would notice / care enough to sue them for false advertising?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBy the way, **PSA:**  If you purchased the Fallout 76 \"Power Armor\" Collector's Edition, ***DO NOT*** accept Bethesda's 500 Atoms, as doing so will affect your ability to participate in a class action lawsuit.

Hypothetically, Steam could have some sort of mandate that requires a certain amount off, or to do something specific in order to participate in the sale, which developers definitely want to do since sales spike. However, that hypothetical something may ultimately be a poor decision from the developers point of view. \n\nBasically, I am curious (but certainly not defending) if the tactic is indeed malicious, or a rational response to a Steam policy. If I recall correctly, Steam usually forces developers to remain tight-lipped when it comes to their policies and agreements, so there probably isn't a lot of conclusive information to be had, but I wouldn't be surprised if this was in response to some strong-arm tactic on Steam's part. Who knows? It probably is just some tactic these guys thought they could get away with to earn a few more grand.\n\nedit: Based on what I could find and comments from indie devs that seemed to imply as much, it seems that devs have little agency when it comes to the discount Steam applies to their games. Assuming that to be the case, or even bare some small resemblance to the case, can you really blame devs for not wanting Steam to give away their product? The more I read, the more convinced I become that this is merely a symptom of Steam's relationship with devs. However, I admit that the evidence is probably not objectively convincing, and that my personal threshold to find some fault on the part of Steam may not be as high as other people."}, {"comment_id": "cs38xuf", "post_id": "39gi24", "comment": "What can we do, except not buying games from these developers?"}, {"comment_id": "cs3c0k8", "post_id": "39gi24", "comment": "This can easily be fixed by adding a \"price history\" column to the game page.

I've been following Telltale all the way back to when they made a pair of games based on Jeff Smith's *Bone* comic books in the 2000s. They were pioneers of independent AA development and have hired and collaborated with some of the best writers to ever write for games.\n\nrandom example: I just beat Tales of Monkey Island last week, and was blown away by a part inspired by insult-swordfighting where Guybrush has to flirt with a manatee, so he learns how to speak manatee through a travel-dictionary. The game then makes you have to whip up witty retorts to a hard-to-get manatee's insults exclusively via the lexicon of a confused tourist.\n\n>Q: Watch where you swim. Nobody knows the way to my heart.  \n>  \n>A: Do you have a map?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Q: I can't stand you insecure males! I don't want anyone with a lot of baggage.  \n>  \n>A: I have nothing to declare.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Q: All of you male manatees are imbeciles. Why do I even bother?  \n>  \n>A: The television does not work.\n\nThis was just one of a ton of really brilliant things I've seen their writers come up with over the decades. And others have gone on to incredible things, from the team of the Firewatch studio to Graham Annable, who now directs Laika films.\n\nThey really pushed the bar, and it really hurts that they got too ambitious after the success of the Walking Dead game. The studio got by so well selling witty pint-sized point-and-clicks to adventure game fans for so long, so it kind of shocks me that they'd expand so quickly and intensely.\n\nConsidering how Telltale grew out of disgruntled Lucasarts employees, maybe that legacy will repeat itself, and we'll see a new generation of studios built from Adventure Game expats continuing the legacy of the genre.

I went to a respected college, all of which now apparently have double-digit shares of international populations (even public schools). Unsurprisingly, Chinese are a huge part of the international student body especially since their economy is booming and higher education is $$$ as fuck. They're more likely to do stuff like A) pay for test banks/test keys B) use homework assignments completed by students who previously took the course C) leave empty cigarette boxes lying around despite being a tobacco-free campus D) keep records of/memorize the quiz/test questions for other students E) slyly look at each-others papers during tests F) cheat during bathroom breaks. \n\nI have to clarify: the overwhelming majority of Chinese students at my school were/are honest, wonderful people who you can trust with your life--it's just that they have more cheaters than the regular student body (especially \"soft\" cheaters). They have about the same rate of \"cheating\" as kids in non-honor/major based fraternities/sororities (higher than the average student population), its just that they are like 2x smarter/craftier and have a bigger network of people to help them.

Rather than go for gimmicks they've made a sort of 'open source' controller that can much more easily be tailored to a specific person's needs, especially considering how compatible it is with, well, anything. That's a new one, especially from Microsoft, really deserves some praise.\n\nWhilst I don't immediately see a way I could readily benefit from it as I don't have many issues with the standard controller, I'm tempted just to get one anyway and see if I can't combine it with a joystick or something, reduce some of the strain on my arms and wrists - hell, my illness aside, I'm tempted just to buy one because I'm a fuckin nerd and I want to see what I can plug into it.\n\nThat said, I do see a potential issue; standard controllers can sit in your lap with your arms in a resting position. Because the adaptive controller needs to be larger I'm not sure what kind of position disabled users will need to hold their arms in - probably closer to a fight-stick, right? Long gaming sessions are already tough from a stamina perspective for the physically disabled. This won't be as much of a problem in a wheelchair that has its own built-in platform, but for, say, the woman at the 0:50 second mark, she needs to hold her hands from above the pad and her arm at an angle. \n\nObviously any controller that's usable is still a big step up - the pedals especially are a fantastic addition - and proper support under the arms will help but if I had to critique one thing, it would be its rigid blocky nature that might make long sessions of play a strain. If it were possible I'd perhaps suggest a future version be entirely modular - maybe a hub that just sits on the floor connected to entirely separated buttons and pads and pedals, with no central controller in one set shape. It'd be a pain in terms of cable management but it would allow users to better place the inputs depending on their physical limitations.\n\nAlthough, it seems maybe you could do that anyway?

But in reading most of those top posts I am shaking my head.  So much misinformation about Linux in it.  I could spend a lot of time responding to each and answering how they are wrong, with citations, but each of those would be equally ignored.  So, I am going to take just one example to show how the basis of what people are saying is wrong so that at least some people might see it.\n\nThe common refrain in most of the top posts boils down to, \"Windows is easier\", coupled with \"Why can't I just double-click to install something like on Windows\", and the ever popular \"I shouldn't have to go to the command-line.\"\n\nHere is what I am putting forth.  Linux, in today's day and age, is *not harder*.  It is *different* than what you're used to and *unfamiliar*.  Windows is familiar, not easier.  Since we're in /r/games I will explain using an analogy to something I hope most of us in the PC world are familiar with.  Steam.\n\nPeople ask, \"Why can't I just double click something to install?\"  Well, for the most part, on every modern distribution that a person only familiar with Windows should be cutting their teeth on (Ubuntu its siblings and children), you can.   Pretty much every piece of software native to Linux that you will want to install is installed not by going to a web site, downloading an installer, running it and then getting the software installed.  It is installed through a package manager.\n\nWhat's a package manager?\n\nSteam.\n\nSure, it's an online store, a file distribution system, a slew of other things.  But at its core Steam is a package manager.  It is a utility which allows you to install *and manage* games from a single place.  You don't bring out the pitchfork and torches, proclaiming that it's easier to install games by going to each manufacturer's website, downloading their installer, and running it.  In fact, large swaths of people who post to /r/games lament when developers decide to make their own storefront because now instead of having one location to install and update their games, they have 2.  Or 3.  Or more.\n\nWhy do I say this is different and that Windows isn't better?  Well, think of all the other pieces of software outside of Steam games which you have installed on your Windows box.  All of those icons in your system tray for small installers all doing the same thing.  They exist to periodically check to see if there is an update and, if there is one, nag you about it.  If you're like me on my work machine I get nagged several times a week to do a one-off update to software on my machine.\n\nHow often does Steam nag you to update your games individually?  It doesn't.  It queues them all up and you can either have them update automatically, or manually kick off that update at your convenience.\n\nNow, imagine that convenience and control that Steam gives over keeping your games up-to-date.  Not just your games but your games' mods if they are on the Steam Workshop.  Not just your base OS, which is all Windows updates normally touched, but all your applications.  And your drivers.  And your supporting libraries.  Everything on your system updated in a timely manner without the constant, one-off, nagging and pestering of each individual program running its own launcher.\n\nPeople ask, \"Why can't I just run an installer?\"  I counter, \"Why ***MUST*** I run an installer?  Why ***MUST*** I go through the constant interruptions to my workday?\"  Or, even worse, why must I have Windows itself forcefully remove me from my game time to tell me I must update now **OR ELSE** it is going to nag me in an hour by doing the exact same thing?\n\nI don't see the Windows way as easier!  Far from it.  It is laborious, it is intrusive, it is inefficient, it is aggravating.  Most of all, it is a problem that has been solved by Steam for games right about a decade ago, and Linux is but one example of how it has been solved for everything else.\n\nWhich brings me to the \"I shouldn't have to go to the command-line.\"  You may feel that way, but trust me, Windows is not immune to it as well.  Just the other day my coworker's networking died.  A reboot didn't help.  What fixed it?\n\nStart, type CMD, type in the following commands:\n\n    ipconfig /release\n    ipconfig /flushdns\n    ipconfig /renew\n\nI'm sure there might be a GUI way to do it (though I have never found it) but think of how easy that is to convey to a coworker while he has a customer on the line and needs his networking back up and running so he can get back to work.\n\nThe reason why so many instructions for Linux default to the command line isn't because you **have** to use it, but because it is **easier to concisely explain the steps in a simple to copy-and-paste format**.\n\nEach Linux website offering advice on how to do something knows that they cannot presume your distribution.  Are you running Ubuntu?  OK, GNome?  KDE?  XFCE?  Mint?  Cinnamon?  What is the one set of directions that works on all of them?\n\n\"Open a command window and run these commands.\"\n\nGetting back to the Steam analogy imagine someone wanted to install a Game which was available on GoG, Steam, the developer's web site and though it'll never happen, Origin, Blizzard's storefront and Epic as well.  If you were going to tell them a way to, say, add a mod to their game how would you begin to be able to tell them where to go in each launcher to find the \"Browse the game's directory?\"  You don't.  You write it with launcher agnostic language and examples.\n\nSay you want to install Steam on your freshly installed Ubuntu machine.  I, not knowing what flavor you have, could spend quite a few minutes trying to tell you, \"OK, so, do you know where your package manager is?  Uhm, no.  Look under the menu for system and something that might say Software and Updates.  No?  Uhm.\"\n\nOr, I could say, \"Open the command line, run this command: sudo apt install steam\"\n\nEven better, if I were typing it in IM you could copy/paste that command and you have successfully installed steam.  But say a few days on you know where your package manager is do you *have* to open the command line to install something?  No.  You see \"sudo apt install steam\" and go \"Oh, open package manager, search for Steam, select it, install.\"\n\nThe processes that the Linux world has built up (and by no means am I ignoring other OSes or Distributions, just confining it for this discussion) is not harder.  I find it easier.  Much easier.  The focus is more on long term stability and convenience rather than short-term convenience but long-term frustration.  Let me tie it all together with one final canard I've seen floating around; graphics drivers.\n\nFirst off, it has been over a decade since I've *had* to install a graphics driver to get the desktop to work on Linux.  This is self-evident as most distributions these days run from a USB stick built from an ISO so you can try it out before installing it from the same.  Fun fact, when I installed my gaming rig's current Ubuntu I played Dungeon Crawl: Stone Soup on Akrasiac server in Firefox which was running on the 2nd monitor from the 18.10 install ISO on USB to pass the time until it finished.\n\nBut, yes, to get some *Windows* games running on nVidia right now you need to install the Beta branch of those drivers.  This is akin to having to install the baseline nVidia drivers *at all* to get the full power of your card on Windows.  So having to do it is not a point against Linux.\n\nWhat people want to do is the familiar.  To go nVidia's web site, go through its process of trying to guide you to the right card, download the installer, run the installer, have it then download the drivers, install the drivers.  Then from that point on have a stub of an installer check for driver updates and, if found, nag you to run it again to get the latest drivers.\n\nHere's the different approach.  Locate the nVidia PPA (Personal Package Archive) and add it to your system.  Update your packages.  Run your package manager.  Locate the updated nVidia drivers.  Mark for install.  Install.  Then from that point on, ***any time you update your system your drivers will be updated as well.***\n\nMind you the baseline nVidia drivers would also be updated, just at a slower pace.  Which is why PPAs were created.  Any why companies should provide PPAs for their drivers.\n\nDifferent, not harder.  Trust me, if you were in the habit of using PPAs and package managers you would look at the hew and cry for individual installers as madness.

Updates are taken care of in the background, most settings changes are done automatically or are easy to find, and the OS is 99.9% stable with issues rarely cropping up. There are things I absolutely despise about Windows, but for the most part W10 is a good OS that is extremely reliable, and can do just about anything that I want it to without problems.\n\nOn the other hand, I can see why Linux will probably never catch on as a widespread desktop OS. Last I checked, only about 1/5 of the games on Steam are playable on Linux, and any major title off of Steam isn't supported. WINE can often be a pain to get working, and still doesn't support every game you'd want to play. No Adobe products run on Linux, which means I couldn't really do any of my hobbies on there. Random things that are non-issues on Windows require giant workarounds to get running on Linux. Sometimes things break because reasons, and you get the privilege of spending hours playing whack-a-mole trying to get up and running again. Sometimes the community is extremely helpful with your issues, or banishes your issue to StackOverflow hell where you never really find a complete answer. \n\nThose are just issues that someone with experience in Linux deals with. For a regular user that's never used anything outside of Windows, it's 100x worse. They won't know how to do the research . They won't know common fixes and workarounds. They won't know anything. Linux is just too hands-on of an OS that alienates normal users, because they're used to stuff actually working.\n\nAnd what would the average user that plays games really benefit from switching? They'd lose most of their library. They'd lose their ability to familiarly navigate a system they've been using for years or decades. They'd lose productivity tools that don't have on-par replacements on Linux. They'd lose time, because their gfx drivers decided that they need the weekend off , or Steam decided it wasn't installed correctly and now needs a workaround of a workaround to get working, and the only relevant question for it got marked as Off-Topic or a Duplicate of a question that doesn't even relate to the problem. \n\nAll of that for an intangible feeling of moral superiority over normal users that just want to play games and to not be bothered about bullshit.

Anyone trying to convince you that Linux development for games is either easy OR worth the effort is naive to the realities of Linux gamedev.\n\nEven when you start with a solid code base and engine/graphics that is 100% supported on both Windows and Linux, the reality is that you cannot do your development concurrently on both; one platform will most certainly lag behind and have to be 'ported' as more and more code gets added and more features are implemented in the game/engine.

Engines like Unity and Unreal appear to be somewhat competent at producing Linux builds (not that I have much experience) so maybe devs are making it harder than it needs to be. To avoid looking hypocritical about my last statement on 'monopoly': I understand that not everyone wants to use Unity / Unreal when making their game but perhaps the difficulty of  giving your game OS compatibility should be factored in when you decide to make your own engine.\n\nAnecdotal (again) but I'll also add that I haven't experienced any graphics driver issues to this date when playing games on Linux with a nvidia gpu and proprietary drivers. But the story might be different if I tried forcing Linux compatibility with Steam Play / Proton.\n\nI am of the opinion however that it most likely isn't worth developing games for Linux if your goal is purely to maximise profit due to the small market share Linux has when it comes to gaming.

This was the case until eighteen months ago, when I experienced a critical change in my circumstances, and was redeposited on these shores. In the time since, I have been able to think occasionally about how best to describe the intervening years, my years of silence. I do first apologize for the wait, and that done, hasten to finally explain (albeit briefly, quickly, and in very little detail) events following those described in my previous letter (referred to herewith as Epistle 2).\n> \n> To begin with, as you may recall from the closing paragraphs of my previous missive, the death of Elly Vaunt shook us all. The Research & Rebellion team was traumatized, unable to be sure how much of our plan might be compromised, and whether it made any sense to go on at all as we had intended. And yet, once Elly had been buried, we found the strength and courage to regroup. It was the strong belief of her brave son, the feisty Alex Vaunt, that we should continue on as his mother had wished. We had the Antarctic coordinates, transmitted by Elly\u2019s long-time assistant, Dr. Jerry Maas, which we believed to mark the location of the lost luxury liner Hyperborea. Elly had felt strongly that the Hyperborea should be destroyed rather than allow it to fall into the hands of the Disparate. Others on our team disagreed, believing that the Hyperborea might hold the secret to the revolution\u2019s success. Either way, the arguments were moot until we found the vessel. Therefore, immediately after the service for Dr. Vaunt, Alex and I boarded a seaplane and set off for the Antarctic; a much larger support team, mainly militia, was to follow by separate transport.\n> \n> It is still unclear to me exactly what brought down our little aircraft. The following hours spent traversing the frigid waste in a blizzard are also a jumbled blur, ill-remembered and poorly defined. The next thing I clearly recall is our final approach to the coordinates Dr. Maas has provided, and where we expected to find the Hyperborea. What we found instead was a complex fortified installation, showing all the hallmarks of sinister Disparate technology. It surrounded a large open field of ice. Of the Hypnos itself there was no sign\u2026or not at first. But as we stealthily infiltrated the Disparate installation, we noticed a recurent, strangely coherent auroral effect\u2013as of a vast hologram fading in and out of view. This bizarre phenomenon initially seemed an effect caused by an immense Disparate lensing system, Alex and I soon realized that what we were actually seeing was the luxury liner Hyperborea itself, phasing in and out of existence at the focus of the Disparate devices. The aliens had erected their compound to study and seize the ship whenever it materialized. What Dr. Maas had provided were not coordinates for where the sub was located, but instead for where it was predicted to arrive. The liner was oscillating in and out of our reality, its pulses were gradually steadying, but there was no guarantee it would settle into place for long\u2013or at all. We determined that we must put ourselves into position to board it at the instant it became completely physical.\n> \n> At this point we were briefly detained\u2013not captured by the Disparate, as we feared at first, but by minions of our former nemesis, the conniving and duplicitous Wanda Bree. Dr. Bree was not as we had last seen her\u2013which is to say, she was not dead. At some point, the Disparate had saved out an earlier version of her consciousness, and upon her physical demise, they had imprinted the back-up personality into a biological blank resembling an enormous slug. The Bree-Slug, despite occupying a position of relative power in the Disparate hierarchy, seemed nervous and frightened of me in particular. Wanda did not know how her previous incarnation, the original Dr. Bree, had died. She knew only that I was responsible. Therefore the slug treated us with great caution. Still, she soon confessed (never able to keep quiet for long) that she was herself a prisoner of the Disparate. She took no pleasure from her current grotesque existence, and pleaded with us to end her life. Alex believed that a quick death was more than Wanda Bree deserved, but for my part, I felt a modicum of pity and compassion. Out of Alex\u2019s sight, I might have done something to hasten the slug\u2019s demise before we proceeded.\n> \n> Not far from where we had been detained by Dr. Bree, we found Jerry Maas being held in a Disparate interrogation cell. Things were tense between Jerry and Alex, as might be imagined. Alex blamed Jerry for his mother\u2019s death\u2026news of which, Jerry was devastated to hear for the first time. Jerry tried to convince Alex that he had been a double agent serving the resistance all along, doing only what Elly had asked of him, even though he knew it meant he risked being seen by his peers\u2013by all of us\u2013as a traitor. I was convinced; Alex less so. But from a pragmatic point of view, we depended on Dr. Maas; for along with the Hyperborea coordinates, he possessed resonance keys which would be necessary to bring the liner fully into our plane of existence.\n> \n> We skirmished with Disparate soldiers protecting a Dispar research post, then Dr. Maas attuned the Hyperborea to precisely the frequencies needed to bring it into (brief) coherence. In the short time available to us, we scrambled aboard the ship, with an unknown number of Disparate agents close behind. The ship cohered for only a short time, and then its oscillations resume. It was too late for our own military support, which arrived and joined the Disparate forces in battle just as we rebounded between universes, once again unmoored.\n> \n> What happened next is even harder to explain. Alex Vaunt, Dr. Maas and myself sought control of the ship\u2013its power source, its control room, its navigation center. The liner\u2019s history proved nonlinear. Years before, during the Disparate invasion, various members of an earlier science team, working in the hull of a dry-docked liner situated at the Tocsin Island Research Base in Lake Huron, had assembled what they called the Bootstrap Device. If it worked as intended, it would emit a field large enough to surround the ship. This field would then itself travel instantaneously to any chosen destination without having to cover the intervening space. There was no need for entry or exit portals, or any other devices; it was entirely self-contained. Unfortunately, the device had never been tested. As the Disparate pushed Earth into the Nine Hour Armageddon, the aliens seized control of our most important research facilities. The staff of the Hyperborea, with no other wish than to keep the ship out of Disparate hands, acted in desperation. The switched on the field and flung the Hyperborea toward the most distant destination they could target: Antarctica. What they did not realize was that the Bootstrap Device travelled in time as well as space. Nor was it limited to one time or one location. The Hyperborea, and the moment of its activation, were stretched across space and time, between the nearly forgotten Lake Huron of the Nine Hour Armageddon and the present day Antarctic; it was pulled taut as an elastic band, vibrating, except where at certain points along its length one could find still points, like the harmonic spots along a vibrating guitar string. One of these harmonics was where we boarded, but the string ran forward and back, in both time and space, and we were soon pulled in every direction ourselves.\n\nContinued below"}, {"comment_id": "dm3h6ke", "post_id": "6vvymy", "comment": "I was not expecting this kind of closure.

The stages of grieving are clear and present here across the board in flying colors. Others are reliving certain stages of grief and encouraging others to move on as they have years ago. I respect that. \n\nFor me the experience of sitting back and waiting for episode 3 or half life 3 was similar to most. I checked forums, I subscribed to groups, I signed petitions, and heck... I might have even prayed once. \n\nAll of that doesn't matter though as the evidence was slapping me in the face plain as day once they stopped talking about the game and major members of the development team left valve. You almost hold out for hope like a parent does for their comatose child... \n\n\"Maybe today is the day?\" you told yourself almost daily. At least you did. Slowly, but surely, you stop visiting those groups, following those forums, and unsubscribe from those petitions you signed, and heck... You finally stopped praying. It's like you stopped visiting your comatose child in the hospital so much because your own life got in the way. \n\n\"They'll announce it when they're ready.\" you tell yourself. The doctors will call when your child wakes up.\n\nEvery once in a while someone will mention some new leak or piece of information and you'd get excited again! Hope would return! Then a week or two would pass and things would go back to \"normal\". What is \"normal\" at this point, you might ask. Hope. Hope is normal. But hope is also a slow death. If you never allow yourself to perceive the reality of things, hope will all but consume you. \n\nSo in closing, here on this website, I lay my single red rose at the grave of a man I once knew and loved. I visited him often and always looked forward to seeing him. I admit over the years I didn't visit as often but, that didn't mean I didn't care. With a heavy heart I give this goodbye. Much the same as a parent who has to do the most difficult thing they may ever have to do...

It\u2019s common sense.  People act like Sony should be totally cool with letting Xbox and Switch users tap into Sony\u2019s user base, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be any advantage for Sony to permit it and as mentioned before, there\u2019s no evidence this is hurting Sony financially.  \n\nThis same argument happened last generation but it was Microsoft as the online leader with a bigger user base, and they didn\u2019t allow it either.   Now Microsoft wants to do this, and I can\u2019t help but think they\u2019re using it to market and spin themselves as the good guy and Sony as the greedy empire.  This is a situation where Microsoft has nothing to lose since they\u2019re so far behind Sony.   There are XB1 owners who might be looking to buy some new hardware, it might be tempting to pick up a PS4/PS4Pro to play with their friends that are on PSN, also they might be interested in the PS4 exclusives.   If CrossPlay exists, one of the reasons to jump to PS4 disappears. Microsoft hopes to keep that consumer on the XBox platform and use their money to upgrade to a XB1X instead of a jump to PS4.   \n\nI think majority of the console consumers don\u2019t care or even realize this is an issue or possibility.   That\u2019s because majority of consumers fall into the \u201ccasual\u201d type range.   We have a very vocal minority that we see on Reddit and certain message boards because those are people that are more in-tune with the day to day news of these hobbies/interest (this particularly being video games).   This article by IGN is made just to appease that vocal group and get some clicks and stir up that base, they know it gets posted on social media, people will agree and share.  But this article says a lot of opinion and uses words and descriptors that make it come across as if they\u2019re speaking factual or as if Sony is foolish (stubborn) to not jump on board.      Who knows, in this case, Sony could be the pig making their house out of bricks, and it may appear stubborn, until its later realized their decision is wise.   It\u2019s too over-reactionary.   \n\n**A little off-topic: **I\u2019m a gamer and I can admit, as a gamer I can be a bit demanding or entitled, I think it\u2019s a trait a lot of gamers have, some more than others.   We all want free online play, we all want family share digital games, we all want backwards compatibility (especially digitally), we all want free updates, and we are even upset to have to pay $60.  Gamers forget/ignore that NES games  cost $50 and N64 games cost $70.  Inflation alone should make todays games cost more ($100+). The gigantic costs of development should make these games cost more too.   Some people are even arguing we shouldn\u2019t have console exclusive games because it\u2019s anti-consumer, not realizing some of the best games turned out so well because they were exclusive and got more funding to help sell that system, they were given earlier access to dev kits because they were an in-house studio and because the game was specifically built around that hardware.   **Back on topic though**, this CrossPlay outrage reminds me of the demands and entitlements that gamers have that I just don\u2019t see as a big deal, and may actually hurt some of the ecosystem in which the consoles require to survive.    Outrage about lootboxes, and things of that sort are much more deserving, I\u2019m not saying all demands aren\u2019t justified, but this seems like a big overblown concern.

We should definitely fight to not encourage negative addiction loops, but the current shift in the law means that in some places any randomised reward system, even bought with a non-purchasable currency, is considered gambling if the content found inside is considered to have possible real money value. This means even if you make it impossible to buy a lootbox with real money, as your ingame currency is not purchasable, the fact the content can be bought outside of the lootbox, means it is considered gambling. As a developer you're forced to not allow players to unlock all content through playing if that reward structure has an element of randomness attached to it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm not sure if this is fair or not yet. Videogame addiction is definitely real, and there's a line to tread between creating addictive behaviour for profit vs creating addictive mechanics which have a forced exit point.

I posted this on my twitter via twitlonger, but I figured I'd share it here even though I'm sure it will probably be downvoted heavily (I don't care much for karma anyway though). Here goes:\n\n>Today EA discussed the concept of loot-boxes with a UK Parliament Committee and, full disclaimer, I do not have an anti-loot box view, nor am I pro-loot box. I sit in the middle. I believe if the consumer wants to buy loot boxes, then they should have the right to do so as it is their money, but I also believe that if they don't want to buy them, then they should be able to earn everything in the loot-boxes in some other way.  \n>  \n>Now in this discussion with the UK Parliament Committee, EA called loot-boxes 'Surprise-Mechanics' which I'll admit, sounds stupid (not the best name you could have picked EA), however, they also linked it to items like Kinder Surprise, Hatchimals and LOL Surprise items which you can buy in stores in various countries. Now in America, I am fully aware that Kinder Surprise is banned there (not sure about the other two) but the concept is simple, buy the product, eat the chocolate (in the case of the Kinder Surprise) then open the plastic shell inside the chocolate to reveal a random toy, you have no way of knowing what toy you'll get either.  \n>  \n>That simple randomized mechanic, where you don't know what you get until you open the item is the same mechanic used in loot boxes, as well as in extremely popular trading card games, such as Magic the Gathering, Pokemon and Yu-Gi-Oh. They sell booster packs, which cost between $5-10 and you can buy these in multiple stores. You buy a pack, you open it up and you get an assortment of random cards. Some may be powerful and rare, others may be more common. You can get duplicates, you can get worthless cards, and what's worse is that in the case of TCG packs, these cards have a real-world value.  \n>  \n>What this means, of course, is that if we are going to claim that loot boxes are gambling, then we also need to put Magic the Gathering, Pokemon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Kinder Surprise, Hatchimals, LOL Surprise and any product that gives a random item in that same box, and yet, we allow the sale of all of these items to children and we don't kick up a fuss at any of those. Additionally, none of the other brands that I listed there have any mechanical protections behind them which limit spending. If a child wanted to, they could walk into a store with all their money (or their parents Credit Card) and purchase an entire box of Magic the Gathering booster packs, or an entire box of Kinder Surprise. Nothing is stopping them, whereas when it comes to loot boxes, every major platform has a form of parental controls which when set up, can prevent any online purchases, making them completely impossible to buy, and those same controls can be set up for those who have gambling addictions as well, with a trusted friend or family member being the individual in control to ensure that they don't spend any money on loot boxes.  \n>  \n>Finally, I think it's time we all admitted, that while this is a divisive issue, it will also never be one that gets solved in the way that folks with an anti-loot box stance would like. Sure, if you're in the Netherlands and Belgium, those countries have already considered them gambling and acted accordingly (something I opposed because I do not like the idea of grown adults being told where they can and can't spend their money by the government). But while Belgium and the Netherlands have opposed loot boxes, Australia and the UK have not, and do not consider them gambling, and the United States, while having gotten bi-partisan support for a bill which would restrict loot boxes, will likely not follow through, as the American Government at this point in time is 100% pro-business, and it is highly unlikely that they will pass any bill which impacts business profits, which loot boxes do make up a substantial slice of.  \n>  \n>Either way, this is a complex issue, and it's not one that is going to be solved any time soon. As for me? I'll pay attention to the news surrounding this issue, and give my thoughts where appropriate, as I always do.\n\nAnyway, those are my thoughts, so, take them as you will.

This would be a clever way to not only set up the story and the player's motivation, but also give a logical reason why both characters aren't available.\n\nBut here's why I think both are playable: notice that Zelda is not only dressed very similarly to Link in the cutscene, but her hair is cut short. I think this is for practical reasons relating to design and performance. All armor and clothing would have to fit both. You don't want hair jutting clipping through a helmet, and it's more efficient than designing two variants of everything. On a performance level, I'm guessing it's also easier than having to include hair physics.\n\nEdit: The question really comes down to whether each character would play the exact same, or have unique abilities (also like Dishonored 2).

MMOs thrive on longevity and having prior investement into the game. Picking up a character from 'ten' years ago and progressing through new parts of the same world is one of the major reasons WOW is still alive. Gamers are invested in it already. One can start up again were one left of, the earlier progress isn't lost, only devalued. While its still fundementaly the same game, ideally one wouldn't devalue to the degree one does in WOW, as alot of old content is wasted, why not let new or old players do old content at the correct difficulty, such a waste. Expansions should include changes that keeps the old content playable, making expansions go 'gold' any new changes only applying on the new content. Timewalking kind of works, but its still too limited. As you can't progress through the old content properly. Its only a one week kind of thing and something you mainly do for the weekly quest. Mythic+ timewalking would be great, aswell as old raids as a gearing mechanic, maybe scaling in a way similar to M+ and flex. \n\nIdeally raid progression would start in Vanilla and end with the current newest content. IE one would need MC gear to gain 'Raid ilvl' which one would need to do BWL and so on. Skill and other catchup mechanics for alts etc would be needed, though its probably not possible to do it this way. Some way to make old content relevant again maybe as a learning tool. MC has much easier mechanics than Antorous, though many of them are fundamentaly the same. LFR as leveling raids scaling like the normal dungeons does, would probably be the most realistic. \n\nBack to more general things. Why play another MMO if one can play a game one already is heavily invested in. Why realearn all the small details in ESO or GW, if one can just resub to WOW where one just has to learn a new rotation, stat priority and dungeons. Without having to be a alomst total noob again. One can focus on the new content. Instead of the whole game. \n\nThe COD businessmodel is probably very profitable, it might not function as well in an MMO setting though. As character based MMOs are all about character development. And the resets of the expansions are already one of the weakest points in WOW. As the transition isn't very smooth. Having a whole new game just makes this a bigger issue, as there might be even larger gameplay changes than new class abilities and balance changes, the timings of turning, jumping, compensating for lag etc is still the same, in a whole new game thats not the case. Having to level on top of gearing again is a big enough 'reset'. It can be nice to break up the mononity of the endgame though, this could be done through new more challenging content patches aswell though. Theres alot of room to improve the progression of MMOs. Its one of the things EVE does very well, the progression curve is very clear from early on (get a big ship and explore the world and you do it the same way all through the game, just at a larger scaler) and is the same. While in a game like WOW its not at all that way. You start out with a Solo and small group game. which tranistions into a large group kind of game. Its almot two different games. Add in hard character resets and microtransactions and its a recipie for 'failure', atleast in a game design perspective.

Sure looked pretty though I guess. \n\nI miss the days when there was so much creativity in the license, giving rise to things like KOTOR, Republic Commando, Empire at War, Starfighter, Rogue Squadron games, Jedi Outcast / Academy, etc. \n\nGranted, there's been quite a lot of bad Star Wars games in the past too, but all of the good games made up for the bad. Feels like they're just too afraid to take the creative risk and produce something that can't be mass marketed anymore.

I could also really imagine adults and even old people having that same childlike joy and it just looks like a ton of fun being able to punch around as a cardboard robot. Add in all the extra functions of the Joy-Cons (HD Rumble, IR Camera, fantastic positional tracking) and this idea is absolute gold. It's almost like makeshift VR, without the goggles, but with much more realistic interactivity.\n\nIf the actual \"gameplay,\" including the assembly process, is well designed (which I would expect because it's Nintendo) and they expand on Labo as it's own whole brand like they used Wii Fit and other games like the MyCoach series to make the Wii appeal to those who wanted to use it as an exercise helper/health monitor, this has huge potential - every parent will want a Switch to make/play these with their kid! \n\nAnd they also get all the other awesome parts of the Switch, either for the parents or their kids to play, or both! This is a great business move to attract that crowd, and I'm sure those cardboard cutouts cost next to nothing for Nintendo to produce (and it looks like they're charging $10-20 for a kit since the game bundled with one of the less expansive kits is $70 and the robot suit is $80). If they do a bundle this holiday season with Labo included for $300, and they've gotten word of mouth marketing all year like they did last year, this could break records.

Now,\nthe game releases \"Expansions\" every year similar to WoW. These need to be purchased in one time payments and then you have access to all the content released for the expansion throughout the year. These contents are released in \"seasons\" four times a year, so you can think of it like one expansion with four major updates within that year. \n\nYear 1 (launched Sep 2017) refers to the base game (now being named Destiny 2: New Light). This features:  \n\n- the initial story and all of the raid content\n- Curse of Osiris DLC (new zone, story, etc.)\n- Warmind DLC (new zone, story, level cap, etc.)  \n(Note: DLC launches were abandoned in Year 2 in favor of annual pass structured releases)\n\nYear 2 (launched Sep 2018) is Destiny 2: Forsaken, featuring new story, level cap, and expansion updates which can be found on the right of this info-graphic (those requiring the Annual Pass) [here](https://cdn.gamerant.com/wp-content/uploads/destiny-2-year-2-roadmap.jpg.optimal.jpg)\n\nYear 3 (launching Sep 2019) is the upcoming expansion, Destiny 2: Shadowkeep. \n\nIt's worth noting with this change you will only have access to the base game for free and (as far as I can tell) you will still be required to pay for access to Forsaken and Shadowkeep. In that sense moving to \"free to play\" will not grant you open access to all of the content, there will still be a paywall.\n\nLivestream for new info can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/bxj00e/the_future_of_destiny_2_bungie_livestream/)"}, {"comment_id": "eq6hzo9", "post_id": "bxgker", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eq6d9zn", "post_id": "bxgker", "comment": "This is super interesting.

(Even something like 250mb a second)\n\nAside from streaming things very efficiently, it would really shine in that the sharing of dense/complex information and media would become nearly instantaneous. \n\nYou wouldn't really need to keep a library stored on your external harddrives in a world where you could download an entire Next Gen Game in less than a minute. \n\nWhen you could pop into a full quality 1:1 version of any movie at any time. \n\nTo me it always felt like Capitalism was the scaffolding we needed as a society to pull us out of the dark ages. But currently we live in an age where most of our technology has grown out the reigns of Capitalistic Control. So we're forced to implement Laws to tell people not to use Technology to it's fullest extent. \n\nPiracy is a great example of this conundrum. \n\nIn the past Record labels were hugely responsible for the massive rise and growth of the music industry and music in general. The traditional means of making money off a record is still here today despite the fact that our technology has enabled us to instantly share any and all forms of music at the click of a button. \n\nThe major music players (like the IP holders in OP's case) had made their profits through traditional avenues. So they refused to change their business model, arrogantly thinking they could steer the course. \n\nBut as a result, SoundCloud and the rise of the indie artist has shown them that an entirely different business model can exist. Let out as much of your music for free and then make your money off shows, merch sales, and other deals. \n\nPiracy is absolutely not Theft. It's a unique situation that only exists because we as humans are clever as fuck. The only people who benefit from Piracy being illegal are the few who still have a tight outdated grip on their industries. Versus literally the rest of the planet who would benefit from it being legal. (And likely those few would benefit too in ways if they could only realize)\n\nSimple Example is the CBD isolated strain of Medical Marijuana called Charolette's Web. Hugely helpful for patients suffering from Seizures and other ailments, yet when it first was introduced, some people tried to patent it and give it CopyRight. The Marijuana community reacted by pirating the medicine and making it easily available for those who need it. \n\nWhether it's a life changing medicine or an amusing multiplayer video game, the world would benefit from having access to it. \n\n\"But us Devs and Publisher's need to make a living too!\"\n\nAnd now you see why our current economic system is not apt to deal with the coming societal growing pains of shifting away from a Work Force Fueled Capitalistic setup. \n\nIf survival wasn't a constant motivator for most people to make money, then they'd be free to explore their passions for passion's sake, not profit's."}, {"comment_id": "drm9km1", "post_id": "7lg9jl", "comment": "This could be completely avoided if companies were forced to release server software along with the client software.

If you look back at E3 this year, it was clear Sony didn\u2019t have a whole lot of stuff to show off. The stuff they did show off was strong but smaller than the previous E3s this generation. Considering their big upcoming titles are well known: The Last of Us 2 and Death Stranding being the two big ones, I think they want to avoid any more over saturation. Death Stranding has been teased at like 3 press conferences, Last of Us 2 at about two now. They just need to finish those games up. \n\nI also think they want to try and avoid padding the conferences with games that might be too early to talk about. It\u2019s been happening a lot with Sony. Think back to No Man Sky, Final Fantasy Versus XIII/XV...oh AND the VII remake, Shinmu 3, Death Stranding. Maybe it\u2019s best they step away, cool off, and then come back swinging at a later date. \n\nThe other thing to consider is MS seems to be making moves towards next gen. Rather than go through with an E3 that will be similar to last year next to Xbox\u2019s potential next Console reveal, maybe they\u2019d prefer to pull back see what Xbox does and then try and 1up them the following year. They can have mini events or something for when these next titles launch so they aren\u2019t forgotten and then come out in 2020 with announcements for a PS5 and the next wave of titles.

To see if loot boxes can be defined as a form of gambling and if loot boxes break Belgian Law.\n\n* This investigation defined what they consider loot boxes and identified the methods companies get users to purchase them *(pages 5-8)*.\n\n* The investigation compared the consumer protection intent of the Gaming and Betting Act to see if loot boxes violated Law *(definitions pages 8-12; analysis pages 12-15, findings pages 15-7)*.\n\n*****\n\nPersonally, I find the key takeaway here is that the Belgian Gaming Commission admits that loot boxes are not inherently gambling *(page 16)*:\n\n> From the legal-technical perspective, the loot boxes themselves do not fall under the definition of gambling\n\nWhat does make the implementation of loot boxes in these games illegal is that they violate the very specific protections of consumers present in the Gaming and Betting Act.\n\nThe four main conditions needed to be applied under that law are as forth defined as *(Page 8)*:\n\n> a game of chance is any game whereby a bet of any kind that is placed leads to the loss of this bet by at least one of the players, or a win of any kind for at least one of the players or organisers of\nthe game, and whereby chance may even be a secondary element in the course of the game, indication of the winner or determination of the size of the winnings.\n\nInterpretations made for these conditions to be fulfilled in the context of these loot boxes are exceptionally interesting. If EA were to argue these findings, it is quite possible that a different individual(s) would come to a different conclusion on certain key points, instead ruling that loot boxes are not in violation of the Law.\n\n*****\n\n**Exceptionally important** is that these findings do not inherently find loot boxes to be illegal.\n\nInstead, loot boxes in the context of the investigated games were found to be \"games of chance\" and that games of chance require a license in order to operate *(page 8)*:\n\n> Based on Art. 4 of the Gaming and Betting Act, it is in\nprinciple forbidden to operate a game of chance without first obtaining a permit from the Gaming Commission.\n\nThis would indicate that EA's loot box practices are not illegal, but their refusal to obtain a license to continue is what is illegal."}, {"comment_id": "e5swwrp", "post_id": "9f0amz", "comment": "I'm gonna need an explanation on how it went from EA counter-suing/appealing/whatever against a new law to a criminal investigation opening on EA...\n\nEDIT: Not a new law.

So they can't actually determine if loot boxes in any way act as a gateway to gambling. Why do they then pretend that the study determined that?\n\n2. This study was advertised and got participants **from Reddit**, and was advertised as being about gambling and loot boxes, at a time when loot boxes were all over the news being called gambling and attacked. That doesn't sound like an ethical way to get a non-biased set of participants, does it?\n\n3. It largely focussed on loot boxes where you use 3rd party against the TOS sites to sell loot box contents, but pretty much interchanges ones where you can't do that with ones where you can at will, confusing the matter so to paint all loot boxes in the same light as ones that offer financial rewards.\n\n4.

If it's fairly balanced by being able to reasonably get all in-game items without the need to spend a penny (like Pokemon Go), then that's not anti-consumer. Using the same example, if my friend had spent \u00a31, and another had spent \u00a3500, both of them still have just as good a chance at having the best Pokemon as the stuff you can buy only helps with eliminating the grind of getting extra items like pokeballs and potions - things like stardust to power up your Pokemon cannot be purchased and so therefore can only be obtained through normal gameplay like everything else. PoGo has a shit ton of issues and overall doesn't have great longevity to me, but IMO they do microtransactions fairly.\n\nHaving to spend \u00a320 on a car that would otherwise take you the same time it would take you to save up for that car in real life (like GTA), that's anti-consumer, as it's blatantly price gouging for items that are nowhere near their current value and are practically impossible to get in-game without spending extra money.\n\nSeperate from this, is MTX in the form of Steam workshop, whereby the gamers themselves regulate the prices of skins and other in game items. Things like loot crates in PUBG, for the most part, are purchased using real money sold by other people, not PUBG Corp directly. Similarly, CSGO skins like the Asiimov branded skins are set in price by the community, they've declared how much it's worth and so that's why it is that price. Once again however, this is a seperate issue from Valve selling loot boxes directly without us knowing exactly what the chances are of getting each item - This is anti-consumer, but the actual act of selling loot boxes isn't, as it doesn't help you get a leg up over anyone else and doesn't disturb the balance of gameplay whatsoever. That being said, the way they've allowed kids to purchase these loot boxes is anti-consumer and completely immoral.\n\nMTX is inherently anti-consumer, it's greedy companies that have made their implementations anti-consumer, there's a lot of Gray area in between as well that makes it quite dangerous to label MTX as bad as a whole. It's not the transaction type that needs to be regulated, it's the implementations."}, {"comment_id": "e657z03", "post_id": "9gks7d", "comment": "Game companies use established strategies to get more money money out of their users, and now the weather.

I dont know how to describe it. I just know that i have a harder time aiming in this game that in Blackout.

Many claimed they weren't angry about the anti-Nazi stance per se, but rather that the game was tapping into liberal anger.

Context is king - if the swastikas (and also other anticonstitutional symbols such as the SS runes) are used to criticise Nazism (i.e. Nazis are the villains), portray the Nazi era as a background scenario or parody it (e.g. South Park: The Stick of Truth), it's a fairly safe bet that the USK will let it slide.\n* Games that glorify National Socialism (e.g. neo-nazi propaganda such as KZ-Manager, Ethnic Cleansing) are fairly certain to remain banned. That's fine with me personally.\n* Games that let you uncritically play the Nazis in a war context (e.g. Hearts of Iron 4) are likely to be a litmus test for the boundaries of this change.\n* It doesn't mean that banned games using the swastikas are automatically unbanned. These bans (\"Beschlagnahmen\", lit. \"confiscations\") need to be reversed with an petition before a court of law. There aren't many such games.\n* It also doesn't mean that indexed games using the swastikas (e.g. anything not Wolfenstein) are automatically unindexed. This is a matter for the BPjM, which is separate from the USK. If the BPjM chooses to deindex swastika-bearing games (I assume the USK coordinated this with them), the publishers are free to resubmit the games for reclassification. I imagine that publishers will have to submit deindexing applications to the BPjM to have their games deindexed.\n* Not all games bearing swastikas have been indexed, so the publishers may end up resubmitting the uncensored versions of this without needing to request deindexing. Call of Duty: WW2 falls under this category.\n* Aside from the obvious advantages of having an \"uncensored\" game, one of the key advantages here (and the main issue for most gamers I believe) is that bespoke versions for the German market are no longer necessary. Many German gamers prefer to play such games in the original English language, which simply wasn't possible with the censored German versions, as these \"bespoke\" versions would usually only feature German-language support."}, {"comment_id": "e3vopqb", "post_id": "95v28u", "comment": "So does this mean more games in the future will start using it instead of the iron cross?

That's the real problem with the game. You can train your eyes to use ASCII easily enough but nearly every button on the keyboard having a function and the game having very little overall help on any of it's controls? That's a big problem. IIRC it went even further by having controls modified by shift or control meaning some keyboard keys had multiple commands associated to them.\n\nThe way it's controlled (or was last time I tried) makes it hard for anyone who finds using the keyboard difficult to play it. If you've only got one working arm then it's probably close to impossible without rebinding every single function in the entire game. It's 2019 and we know how drop down menus and right click menus and context sensitive menus function. There's no reason why a game like DF has to be so arcane in it's control method when those options exist. It's not impossible to do anymore. And even if you still had to use keyboard inputs you'd still be drastically cutting down on the number people would have to memorize. Or even better, unify the controls so different menus don't use different controls. THAT'S surely not hard.\n\nLCS, Tarn's other game I played had the same issue. No unified control scheme throughout any of the menus or options. One input could do drastically different things depending on where you were menu wise. It's awful.\n\nI do have a messed up shoulder and prolonged use of the keyboard aggravates it. I have this same problem with traditional Roguelikes. Tales of Maj'Eyal proves you can make a 100% mouse driven interface for a game of that type but so many (including paid ones) refuse to do it. It's not only makes the games unnecessarily hard to control but it also limits the potential people who can play your games.

Basically a \"find players offline\" button. Now, it's fine if they need to register to actually talk to anyone. But the initial link should already lead them to a page that shows other players / people interested in the game, and it should be possible to enter a location right away to show nearby players, or ideally to retrieve it from the device automatically.\n\nRight now, I'm not seeing any sort of landing page for specific games to link to, and even if I were to link to the gamer search page, users would have to register before they could even enter a game themselves. So yeah, such a page would be nice. Bonus points if it has a header for the game, to seem less foreign when coming from somewhere else. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nNot sure if that's a direction you want to go in, but if you do, maybe speak to some of the more well-known local multiplayer indie game developers.

They are effectively taking $18,000 a month from the community and delivering nothing. And it was north of $24,000 a month or two back!\n\nListen, multiplayer Skyrim is the dream. I would LOVE to play it someday! But if there's one thing you should take away from this post, it's that you absolutely should not trust the Skyrim Together team with any of your personal information. And given that you must make an account and play through their dedicated servers... if you ever decide to give it a go, please just be smart and use a burner email and password. These people CANNOT be trusted, and so you should not give them any information that could be valuable to them, or harmful to you. \n\nIf you want to support a truly community-driven multiplayer Elder Scrolls experience, I urge you to check out OpenMW and its accompanying add-on, TES3MP. Here's a link to a good thread on r/skyrimmods talking about it, and it also has links to Patreon pages if you want to support people who aren't running off with $18,000 a month: https://www.reddit.com/r/skyrimmods/comments/avkqo7/skyrim_support_in_openmw_and_the_possibility_of_a/\n\nIt works, and it's wonderful. Morrowind is already fully playable in co-op. But interestingly, they are building towards a future where other Bethesda games (Oblivion, Skyrim, but also the Fallout games) are supported. If that happens, you'll be able to enjoy Elder Scrolls and Fallout in multiplayer, built at the engine level.  No need to connect to servers or create accounts, host them yourself! \n\nThanks for taking the time to read. I've been a long-time follower of this project, and maybe one of the few people left in the community who followed Yamashi during the Skyrim Online days.

If it's not much, or some people are left out of the pot, or some people are given a greater share because of earlier contributions, then I could see where someone not getting any money out of this, but is an active volunteer contributor might feel this way.

The lack of a strong vision for the game keeps coming up again and again in this article.\n\n>One longstanding BioWare tradition is for their teams to build demos that the staff could all take home during Christmas break, and it was Anthem\u2019s turn during Christmas of 2016. By this point, BioWare\u2019s leadership had decided to remove flying from the game\u2014they just couldn\u2019t figure out how to make it feel good\u2014so the Christmas build took place on flat terrain. You\u2019d run through a farm and shoot some aliens. Some on the team thought it was successful as a proof of concept, but others at BioWare said it felt dull and looked mundane.\n\n>In the beginning of 2017, a few important things happened. In early March, Mass Effect: Andromeda launched, freeing up the bulk of BioWare\u2019s staff to join Anthem, including most of BioWare\u2019s Austin office. The Montreal office began to quietly wind down and eventually closed, leaving BioWare as two entities rather than three.\n\n>Around the same time, Electronic Arts executive Patrick S\u00f6derlund, to whom BioWare\u2019s leadership reported, played the Anthem Christmas demo. According to three people familiar with what happened, he told BioWare that it was unacceptable. (S\u00f6derlund did not respond to a request for comment.) He was particularly disappointed by the graphics. \u201cHe said, \u2018This is not what you had promised to me as a game,\u2019\u201d said one person who was there. Then, those developers said, S\u00f6derlund summoned a group of high-level BioWare staff to fly out to Stockholm, Sweden and meet with developers at DICE, the studio behind Battlefield and Frostbite. (DICE would later bring in a strike team to help BioWare work out Frostbite kinks and make Anthem look prettier.)\n\n> Now it was time for a new build. \u201cWhat began was six weeks of pretty significant crunch to do a demo specifically for Patrick S\u00f6derlund,\u201d said one member of the team. They overhauled the art, knowing that the best way to impress S\u00f6derlund would be to make a demo that looked as pretty as possible. And, after some heated arguments, the Anthem team decided to put flying back in.\n\n>For years, the Anthem team had gone back and forth about the flying mechanic. It had been cut and re-added several times in different forms. Some iterations were more of a glide, and for a while, the idea was that only one exosuit class would be able to fly. On one hand, the mechanic was undeniably cool\u2014what better way to feel like Iron Man than to zip around the world in a giant robot suit? On the other hand, it kept breaking everything. Few open-world games allowed for that kind of vertical freedom, for good reason; if you could fly everywhere, then the entire world needed to accommodate that. The artists wouldn\u2019t be able to throw up mountains or walls to prevent players from jumping off the boundaries of the planet. Plus, the Anthem team worried that if you could fly, you\u2019d blaze past the game\u2019s environments rather than stopping to explore and check out the scenery."}, {"comment_id": "ejyf7e6", "post_id": "b8kcsu", "comment": "A lot of the piece reads like his expose on Andromeda: a tale of a poorly organized/lead team banging their head against Frostbite for things it wasn't designed to do.

I have to wonder: Why is EA allowing this to happen? Why do they continue to give BioWare such a loose leash if this is what they're up to?\n\nAnd *what was BioWare doing* during all the time prior to those 18 months? I understand the complications that Frostbite is adding, but this article makes it clear that the bigger problem with Anthem was a distinct lack of vision and teams having no idea what to actually *do*.\n\nThis article is incredible. Schreier is the best journalist in the gaming scene, and I'm really grateful that he published this.\n\nEDIT: \n\n> Over the months, Anthem had begun naturally picking up ideas and mechanics from loot shooters like The Division and Destiny, although even mentioning the word Destiny was taboo at BioWare. (Diablo III was the preferred reference point.) A few people who worked on the game said that trying to make comparisons to Destiny would elicit negative reactions from studio leadership. \u201cWe were told quite definitively, \u2018This isn\u2019t Destiny,\u2019\u201d said one developer. \u201cBut it kind of is. What you\u2019re describing is beginning to go into that realm. They didn\u2019t want to make those correlations, but at the same time, when you\u2019re talking about fire teams, and going off and doing raids together, about gun combat, spells, things like that, well there\u2019s a lot of elements there that correlate, that cross over.\u201d\n\nMy God. This explains why Anthem makes all of the same mistakes as Destiny 1 despite having every opportunity to learn from them. Management quite simply would not let people talk about Destiny.\n\nEDIT 2: \n\n> Even when they did figure out what was happening, it felt to BioWare Austin staff like they were the grunts. Developers who worked both in Austin and Edmonton say the messaging was that Edmonton would come up with the vision and Austin would execute on it, which caused tension between the two studios. BioWare Austin developers recall offering feedback only to get dismissed or ignored by BioWare Edmonton\u2019s senior leadership team, a process that was particularly frustrating for those who had already shipped a big online game, Star Wars: The Old Republic, and learned from its mistakes. One developer described it as a culture clash between a group of developers in Edmonton who were used to making single-player box product games and a group of developers in Austin who knew how to make online service games.\n\n> \u201cWe\u2019d tell them, \u2018This is not going to work. Look, these [story] things you\u2019re doing, it\u2019s gonna split up the player experience,\u2019\u201d said an Austin developer. \u201cWe\u2019d already been through all of it with The Old Republic. We knew what it was like when players felt like they were getting rushed through story missions, because other players were on their headsets going, \u2018C\u2019mon cmon, let\u2019s go.\u2019 So we knew all these things, and we\u2019d bring it up repeatedly, and we were ignored.\u201d\n\nEdmonton should be ashamed of this. Austin has nearly ten years of experience running a massive online game. They took The Old Republic, a game with an incredibly rocky launch, and made it into something special. They know everything there is to know about situations like this, and most importantly, how to fix them. BioWare's main team had a treasure trove of knowledge on their hands, and ignored it.\n\n\n>  The implication was that Darrah was producing Dragon Age 4. At the time, this was true. This iteration of Dragon Age 4 was code-named Joplin, and those who were working on it have told me they were excited by creative director Mike Laidlaw\u2019s vision for the project.\n\n> But Anthem was on fire, and by October, BioWare had decided to make some massive changes. That summer, studio general manager Aaryn Flynn departed, to be replaced by a returning Casey Hudson. As part of this process, the studio canceled Joplin. Laidlaw quit shortly afterward, and BioWare restarted Dragon Age 4 with a tiny team under the code name Morrison. \n\n\nThis explains Laidlaw's sudden departure from BioWare. Absolute shame. That guy knows how to build a good Dragon Age game. His version of Dragon Age 4 being cancelled and now rebooted makes me lose a lot of faith in the quality of the project. He *is* the Dragon Age franchise, in many ways."}, {"comment_id": "ejyaesi", "post_id": "b8kcsu", "comment": "This is a really great write up.

It's an extremely predictable recipe for a failed software launch, and in this case, obviously that software is a video game.\n\nLine up every single \"rough\" launch from the past 10 years and each one of them has the exact same beats.  I'll keep this short, but it looks like this:\n\n* Project Vision\n* Project Tools\n* Project Scope/Timeline\n\nJust using Destiny and Anthem as examples, both of those had nearly identical stories:  \n\n* The vision was never solidified, people refused to make decisions or look at industry leaders.\n* The tools were never good enough to do the job well.\n* The scope, related to vision, was likely too large, hindering the vision and making it impossible to predict a reasonable timeline.  This necessitated a solid launch date, just to force a project to be made.\n\nAs these pillars crumble, they create death spirals that create additional problems, such as wasted development and broken employee morale.\n\nThis is another typical story.  There is nothing surprising here and nothing that should shock anyone.  This is another software death spiral and if I had to pinpoint the root cause, it all goes back to vision.  Not knowing what you are building, or at least having a vision of a complete product, often sends the whole project crashing down.\n\nAll that said, the current story should be taken cautiously and absorbed with some critical thought.  Private interviews, while critical to reporters, tend to frame everything from the interviewee's frame of reference, and possible exaggerate or downplay other potential reasons/outcomes/explanations.  Some employees of Bioware may feel the way they do, but others may disagree with their notes/words/thoughts given to Jason Schreier.  It's important we remember there are multiple sides to a story.\n\nBut, I think it's clear Anthem had a large project management failure, and that's becoming all too typical in this industry.  The work that the developers did do, in 12-18 months is impressive for WHAT IT IS (albeit incomplete and obviously a work in progress), and we should be careful NOT to make this a personal matter.

They do make a point to mention that the game is in early access, but given how the game is being marketed in consoles I think offering a review is doing a good service to the console market. On PC, the concept of early access isn't foreign and it is something that players have come to terms with what that means and what the expectations for early access are. This short of release is pretty new to consoles and so I don't think the general player base is as familiar with what to expect of a game like this.

If you don't want to be criticised for making an unfinished, buggy game, don't sell one.\n\nEarly access games don't cost early access dollars and whilst fair warning is given, that doesn't change the fact that games like PUBG share a market with similarly priced games that are both feature complete and actually work consistently. If it's being sold, it's a product, and consumers should be informed on how well made that product currently is.\n\nI have an 'early access' game in my library that has been completely abandoned, like many people do, and I'm tired of games like PUBG getting a pass from criticism based on some purely speculative future version. \n\nGames like PUBG could and *should* be reviewed as soon as they are charging very real money for their product just like any other game on Steam. Feel free to then follow up with a launch version review, but only if they actually manage to get there before jumping ship and leaving the game unfinished.\n\nIf the adage *\"Only buy early access if you will enjoy what is actually there right now\"* is true then it should also be true that products should be reviewed based on what is actually there right now.

Granted I *am* old as fuck, I'm 38, but been playing video games non-stop for 35 years on all platforms, and I've loved a lot of different types of games. But I do not understand why this game is popular. This game just sucks and I do not see the appeal whatsoever. In fact, the popularity of all these online-only multiplayer games these days, especially this new \"battle royal\" genre just push me further away. I'm all about a well polished single player experience with a great story. A buggy, unpolished turd of a game, with no story, online-only, just does nothing for me. Combined with the fact that is is \"early access\" is mind boggling to me, why would kids spend money on some buggy unfinished shit? \n\nGet off my lawn"}, {"comment_id": "drie761", "post_id": "7kpysh", "comment": "I'm glad I have my PC, Microsoft should be ashamed of themselves for this holidays exclusive lineup.
