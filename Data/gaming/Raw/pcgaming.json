He was excited to start his new job, and lay down roots in the community. He wasn't worried about losing connections to his old friends, because Robert would play games with them every thursday night. Robert arrived at his new house and called the only ISP that services his house, \"BIG ISP Co.\" They sent a technician the next day to set up his Internet service.\n\n\"Okay, I've got your modem plugged in, now I just need to know what services you use.\" The tech looked down at his tablet and cleared his throat, preparing to read from a list. \"Just stop me when you hear a service you would like to use.\" He began to read, \"BIG Movies, BIG Music, BIG Storage.\" \n\n\"No, I don't use those, I didn't have BIG Internet at my last house.\" Robert replied, \"I think it would be faster if I just gave you a list of what I plan to use.\"\n\n\"That might be a problem, especially if your services don't fit in a BIG Internet bundle we already offer.\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\" \n\n\"Well, do you watch movies online from services like Netflix and Amazon Prime?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I do.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll add the streaming movies package.\" The tech checked off a box, and the monthly price for Robert's quote got higher at the bottom of the his tablet. \"What about television, do you catch up on missed episodes online? \n\n\"Yes, of course! I can't be around all the time when shows are on!\"\n\n\"No problem. I'll add the streaming television package too.\" The tech checked another box, and Robert's quote got higher again. \"How about music, you said you don't use BIG Music, do you want to listen to another internet radio service?\"\n\n\"I have a ton of Spotify playlists! Pretty much one for every occasion.\" \n\n\"Okay, we'll need to add the Music Streaming package, then.\" Another box checked, another increase to Robert's monthly subscription cost. \"Now, how about games, do you use BIG Games to play with friends?\"\n\n\"No, I connect with friends using Discord, and we play all sort of games.\" \n\n\"Discord, huh? VOIP service too, then.\" The tech scrolled through his list looking for VOIP services. He checked the box, and the quote got higher. \"You play games from Steam?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Origin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"GoG?\" \n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWith each \"yes,\" the price of Robert's monthly fee went up.\n\n\"Guild Wars?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Battle.net?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Star Citizen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Candy Crush?\"\n\n\"No. I don't play Candy Crush.\"\n\n\"Great, you're going to love the savings of not paying for Facebook games.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that.\" Robert looked at the tablet. The long list of third party services had come with service charges that ballooned his rate to twice what he expected to pay. \"My last service provider didn't charge me extra to use Netflix or Spotify or Steam. This seems like a racket!\"\n\n\"Well, sir, you're welcome to use a competitor, then. LARGENET services the other side of town. I think their service charges are pretty much the same, so if you care about it so much, you're welcome to move. I won't keep you here.\"\n\n\"That's it, I can pay your fees or move?! Those are my only options?\" Robert was incredulous. \"This can't be legal!\"\n\n\"Completely legal, sir. Net Neutrality is a thing of the past. I am a BIG ISP Co shareholder, and I would be furious if they weren't making all the money they could. LARGENET does it. GIANT CONNECT does it. We have to do it to compete!\"\n\n\"Fine\" Robert said, \"lets just sign this thing.\" \n\n\"Hold your horses, Cowboy\" The technician guffawed at the idea that he was finished. \"We haven't even talked about your data cap yet.\""}, {"comment_id": "dhasp9r", "post_id": "69zn0n", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "dhasyhy", "post_id": "69zn0n", "comment": "I'm seeing 10 install discs and trips to Gamestop in my future yet again.

Have the SD package? No HD video streaming for you, pal. Oh, and if you want to stream that HD video for longer than an hour? Well you need to upgrade to the mega streaming data cap of 250GB for an additional $25/month. Unlimited streaming for only $100 a month extra. And that is only streaming.\n\nYou want a package for online gaming? Get the Gamer package! Don't want to lag out of each match? Buy the Gamer Pro package! \n\nWe know you want to surf the internet and use your favorite apps. So for that we have the App + Browser Choice plan! Browse and use app data for up to 10 hours a month. Each hour after that just $10/hour!\n\nDon't need one of these internet options? Well too bad, we include the minimum of each package, just like with Cable TV where you don't need 360 of the 400 included channels, but you still have to pay for ALL of them! Sounds just great to me!\n\nAnd if you go over any of these allotments, that is A OK! We'll just keep wrenching up that bill!\n\nThe plan will be to completely compartmentalize every aspect of the internet access in order for ISPs to keep tight control and rake in more cash.

I want Net Neutrality. This is really about how we get there, and through what legal scheme - litigation or utility regulation. I completed my law school thesis on Net Neutrality this week. I originally chose the topic because I was so in support of Net Neutrality and wanted to learn more about the topic. After reading more about the legal basis of Net Neutrality, the more I turned against the FCC 2015 Open Internet Order, and am now in favor of Antitrust enforcers at the DoJ and FTC utilizing the Antitrust laws we already have on the books to keep the internet open and free. This is a fight under the Administrative Procedures Act for regulatory authority, and who can do a better job of keeping infrastructure development moving along while keeping the internet open and free.\n\n> The 3 bright line rules of Net Neutrality are no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization. Blocking and throttling are both vicious antitrust violations of refusal to deal, monopoly, essential facilities, and for major ISP that also own content providers, vertical integration claims. Net neutrality is actually an inter-agency jurisdictional fight over who has the power to regulate the internet. If you leave it to the DOJ and FTC, there will be very expensive precedent setting antitrust litigation coming down the pipe. Litigation is expensive, but it may be a better route than a utility regulatory scheme.\n\n> I say this only because, after legal research, it turns out that the 2015 Open Internet Order allows the FCC to set fees, unbundle interconnected networks, define licensing territories, and set rates along with provision requirements. Many people believe this will keep the internet open and free, and it would. But, at a cost. The FCC, for the past two years, has defined \"Advanced Optimal Technology\", using Section 706(c)(1) of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, to dictate that a broadband ISP needs to provide 25 MB/S upload, 3 mb/s download. That's the goal as it is set. Broadband ISPs won't need to go over this number. They update the number every year, and it's kept at a fairly low minimum. This is called a minimum floor. Title II brings broadband and mobile data ISP under a utility scheme for regulation. That scheme sets up all the licensing, fee, interconnected network unbundling, territoriality that you see with, say, water or electricity. The incentive to develop more infrastructure is gone when the FCC tells Comcast, you have the license for the Louisville market, and all you have to provide as a goal to reach is 25 mb/s. There's no more incentive for an ISP to lay more expensive cabling than what can get the subscriber base 25 mb/s. We may need TB/S cabling in twenty years.\n\n> This, along with territorializing network operation licensing, means that we will have a regulated internet that is open and free, but the FCC will give territories of networks to the various providers, and they will be the sole provider in that licensed geographical territory. The utility regulations, much like a water or power utility, make one supplier, or a regulated monopoly, in an area. And setting the floor at 25 MB/S-3MB/S, this means all that each of the companies will have to provide in their legally obtained, yet regulated network territories, is that number. There's no more competition under a regulatory scheme for the big ISPs to provide more than 25mb/s-3mb/s, so they won't, and haven't been.\n\n> I've heard every metaphor in the book. Water company reducing your pressure, content providers trying to get shelf space, the highway and robber barons, etc. Let me ask you a question. How many utilities are there competing in your market for water or electricity? Do you have a choice of your utility provider? In some situations, you may, but that usually has to do with electricity and wheeling to wholesalers and retail buyers (the production source is the same). Utilities require a \"natural forming monopoly\". ISPs, though expensive with high barriers to entry, do not fit the mold of a \"natural forming monopoly\" at all.\n\n> A 2015 FCC survey showed that 50% of Americans have access to two or more competing wired broadband internet service providers at or above 25 mb/s upload, 3 mb/s download. 79% of Americans have access to two or more competing wired broadband internet service providers at or above 10 mb/s download/3 mb/s upload (Netflix video and audio streaming, the biggest use, takes about 15 mb/s). In areas where cabling has been trenched already, it is 1/10 as expensive to route in new cabling, because the trenching lines have already been dug-in and placed for public access. In many places, the ISPs are putting down the trenching lines as they go, but the trenching PVC pipe, or whatever they use, is a public access terminal once it's down. The cabling is private to the ISP. So, competition is growing, and quickly. Where we need stricter legal enforcement is at the municipal level where town and city councils have no idea what they're doing. ISP lawyers come in, talk with silver tongues, and get whatever they want without a real legal challenge, legal or illegal. There is a high barrier to entry, but some major American cities have looked into building their own fiber networks, saw the cost would be between $450-600 million, and then turned around and built a $1.3 billion football stadium. That's where democracy comes in. If you want public option competitors, or smaller, local ISPs to compete, you can subsidize them heavily, or even just make sure the big players aren't committing antitrust violations that keep them out.\n\n> A stated fear, that we're seeing coming to fruition, is a development of wireless networks used for \"tethering\" hot spots. This allows you to turn a smartphone into a wifi hotspot for your computer. If we leave competition open, the corporations will keep trenching lines and building wired infrastructure that expands with technological development. We don't currently know what speeds we'll need in the future. We were on a path to get 1 GB/S speeds. This has slowed because the broadband ISPs now know all they have to meet is the Advanced Optimal Technology baseline - 25mb/s. Soon, wireless mobile data networks will provide faster speeds than that. 5G rollout in 2020 could eclipse the currently mandated 25mb/s. If we allow competition to die on wired internet, we will all be tethering with slightly faster mobile data network internet. We must not regulate the ISPs due to the fact that competition is actually working to get gigabyte fiber cabling put down across America.\n\n> I know it's been slow, and money has been wasted. The key thing to remember about utilities and regulation surrounding them, is that typically, the government must show the good or service exists in a natural forming monopoly. Broadband and mobile data network ISPs are not a natural forming monopoly. We have sufficient antitrust laws to protect most of the concerns of the bright lines rules set forth by the 2015 Open Internet Order. Now, there are more practical legal issues as well, but those can be precedent-set by litigation as well. I contacted some local ISPs that found profitability in rural America surrounding major cities. They have small staffs, and build infrastructure around small towns because the town councils can get them the easiest access to the lines. The big players often hamstring attempts for smaller ISPs to trench cable, this includes illegally. In Indianapolis, the city-council authorized Comcast to put a metal padlock on the public access point box. Some local ISPs attempted to get in, and were turned away. They didn't have the money to go to court, and the Indianapolis City-Council didn't understand anything they said when they went before the Council. These are the more real and practical issues once you step away from the legal jargon.\n\n> Litigation/precedent setting in the court systems will be costly, but having Google or Netflix sue Comcast/Verizon/AT&T for antitrust concerns will settle the matter for good, and keep the infrastructure competition going. Furthermore, the statistics show that competition has been increasing in the national broadband infrastructure market. Public option municipal development has popped up, as have federal grants for statewide development to last-mile end users. Many cities are also using state law controlled private-public partnership agreements.\n\n> I don't think people have really thought this through. I don't think you want one provider who is given a government-regulated monopoly in your area, who provides the minimum mb/s as set by a few FCC chairmen as adequate. We don't want complacency in broadband infrastructure development, and if you don't push a Comcast or Verizon to build GB internet, they won't. If the FCC defines, as they have the last two years, the mb/s requirement standard to work toward at a low number, you won't have the infrastructure for the future in the time that you need it."}, {"comment_id": "dham9zp", "post_id": "69zn0n", "comment": "Sorry for being a Negative Nancy but its a done deal.

By allowing ISPs to control access, they will use that control to serve their purpose (to no fault of their own, after all that's why they exist).

There might even be some LAN matches where owners would call out that no cheats are allowed (and they're obviously banned for tournaments or wagers).\n\nOne of the reasons why these things can proliferate is because of \"the social factor.\" You see people who use it, and you see people who are having fun doing it.

But this is part of the consequence of the political model China uses.  When you have one entity involves and decides on everything, the policy making lacks flexibility.  So there will be people who \"pushes the limit\" to obtain more resources from said entity, thus decreasing economical efficiency.  I believe what we are witnessing is China exporting these inefficiencies to the rest of the world, much like how the developed nations export their garbage to China.\n\nAs to your second point.  Well because of China's agricultural roots, frugality has always been a national character of Chinese.  So to many Chinese, intellectual property is a relatively new concept.  If you can share (with little effort), why not?  And since we already \"shared\" it, why not replicate it, so more people can benefit?\n\nIn summary, I think what OP said are the consequences of Chinese culture and the political model they use.

Players can either pay for the game, or they can get the game for free if they associate their account with their Alipay (Chinese PayPal) account, which links to their real names and bank cards. Cheating will be counted as credit misbehaving, and will do real harm economically. So few people will take the risk.

I\u2019m gonna do my best to ignore the definite bias held by OP, but it\u2019s gonna be hard because his bias both ignores important facts related to each developer and twists certain facts to the point it\u2019s almost a lie. Also, note that I am not a fan of all the missing features on Epic\u2019s store, but I am concerned heavily with fair developer pay and a new place for games to launch with similar success without dealing with Valve\u2019s (almost) non-commitment to creating a quality store-side service for indie developers. \n\n1. OP has edited his post about Rise of Industry after the fact, but RoI\u2019s lead developer Dapper Penguin never was offerred an exclusivity deal from anyone, ever. Epic\u2019s community manager actually came out and stated that they never offerred anything to DP. Epic has nothing to gain out of lying about this. My guess is that DP is using the current Epic controversy to create a story about them taking the high road with exclusivity, and given they just left Steam Early Access, they\u2019re likely looking for additional sales - as proven by the comments on this post, people have already bought the game just because they \u201crefused an exclusivity deal\u201d *even though they were never offered a deal in the first place*. Don\u2019t assume random indie developers were offerred a deal, especially if they come out and say they refused a deal on a highly upvoted post that even hit r/all. \n\n\n2. Factorio easily could\u2019ve been offerred an exclusivity deal, and they definitely said that they have a \u201cno bullshit policy\u201d, which is respectable. However, Factorio has been out for a very long time, and has sold many DRM free copies. They\u2019re very picky about everything in relation to their game, including sales, specific pricing, etc. As u/Spoichiche mentioned, the devs never specified that they\u2019ve declined an exclusivity deal. I doubt that this situation is the same as the RoI issue, but I\u2019m merely pointing out that there\u2019s not really evidence that Factorio has ever gotten into this sort of negotiation with any company for exclusivity. The Factorio devs, though, are the most respectable group out of the bunch mentioned by OP.\n\n\n3. CD Projekt Red owns GOG. They would never take business from their own store, because that\u2019s just dumb of them. They\u2019d make so much off of GOG sales that the Epic deal wouldn\u2019t even compare. Therefore, this is a moot point.\n\n\n4. Chris Avellone is a narrative designer. Sure, he has had many years of experience in the industry, but he does not manage finances. He does not deal with ensuring that devs have proper salaries, health care / insurance, and all the other important monetary parts of game development. Game development is very expensive and incredibly risky - there\u2019s no guarantee that the game will sell, or that the game will even be completed. Microsoft invested likely millions into Scalebound, and that game was just cancelled, meaning no return on investment. If Epic can provide any investment to developers to make development less risky, it most certainly makes sense for them to devs to take it.\nFurthermore, Chris Avellone is not and has not been working at Obsidian for several years. He doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on inside the studio, and he has a negative bias towards Obsidian as a whole due to his negative experiences there. As I mentioned, his opinion may be valid to a degree, but it should be taken with a grain of sale given we don\u2019t know how his bias are showing.\n\nI\u2019d also like to see a source on that quote \u201cit will not be exclusive because of the importance of player choice\u201d, because I have a feeling that is so for other reasons not necessarily concerned with player choice (i.e. resurrected old IP, unknown studio, fan service, etc.)\n\n\nThe whole point of this reply is to say that some developers may be playing members of the Epic hate train to buy their game regardless of quality or even whether the game is of interest to said members, and to say that the musings of a couple developers and/or studios does not represent the whole by any means. Furthermore, I don\u2019t think this represents a case that devs are refusing deals because of potential \u201cbrand damage\u201d, because the majority of users literally don\u2019t care. With a $60 game, the extra revenue off of 6 copies sold (not including Epic down-payment) pays for someone who doesn\u2019t buy it due to said exclusivity deal.\n\n\nI want to re-iterate that I am not a fan of Epic\u2019s lack of features on their storefront. However, I\u2019m also not a fan of seeing these propoganda-level posts aimed at discrediting any developer who chooses an avenue that effectively helps to support them financially. You don\u2019t need to buy games from them, but constantly bringing hate to devs who do decide to choose these deals is not necessarily the answer. If devs get a better deal in terms of how much they earn, then we open up the industry to more \u201crisky\u201d games that ultimately are more creative and inspired, which I\u2019m definitely interested in."}, {"comment_id": "emky44o", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "LOL! 4 diamond, 7 gold and 11 silver for this lie.\n\nThe hate is insane."}, {"comment_id": "emigw5j", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": ">player choice\n\nThese devs truly understand games.

Keep pissing us off because I won\u2019t just remember epic games...I\u2019ll remember the people who worked for you.  To this day I won\u2019t support a dev that worked for EA.  Was looking at a game and saw the ceo worked for EA earlier in his career.  Instant disqualification.  \n\nBesides the little indie devs are putting out better games anyway."}, {"comment_id": "emmk6ox", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "Good."}, {"comment_id": "emhyhfy", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "\"Developers are starting to exploit the blind hate against a video game company for no reason other than sales numbers\"\n\nFixed your title."}, {"comment_id": "emjzdm1", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "This has got to be one of the most bizarre popular posts I've ever seen. \n\nOP, your argument is weak and your post is clickbait. How anyone is taking you serious right now is beyond me, and I'm saying this as someone who has no dog in the fight as I'm on console only and I do not play Fortnite or any other Epic game. \n\nLet's analyze this post. \n\nThe title of the post is \"Developers are already starting to decline Epic exclusivity deals *because of potential brand damage*\"\n\nLet's look at the original post before any of the edits. \n\nThe OP claimed that \"apparently\" Epic tried to snatch Rise of Industry, but the devs declined. The OP then goes on to call Epic scummy for this (no mention of brand damage).\n\nThe next point in OP's crusade against Epic is that it is \"very likely\" that they tried to grab Factorio as an exclusive. There is no evidence that Epic actually attempted to grab them, but I guess that doesn't matter (no mention of brand damage).\n\nThe third point in this holiest of crusades is that CD Projekt Red stated that they will not be exclusive to *any* platform. Literally, someone asked them if Cyberpunk would be exclusive to EGS and they responded that they're not exclusive to anyone (no mention of brand damage).\n\nThe fourth and final point is that an ex-employee of Obsidian disagreed with their decision to make Outer Worlds EGS exclusive. \n\nSo, in summary, the original post had four main points in showing that devs don't want to deal with Epic because of brand damage:\n\nEpic offering exclusivity to Dapper Penguin Studios (Rise of Industry) but they declined. Epic \"likely\" trying to grab Factorio but devs declined. CDPR stating Cyberpunk would not be exclusive to any platform. Ex-employee disagreeing with Obsidian's decision to be exclusive to EGS. \n\nPretty weak argument already, but then once you take into consideration that an Epic rep commented in this thread confirming that they never offered DPS any deals, which forced the DPS dev to clarify and say that it's true, it makes it much weaker.\n\nThat immediately eliminates 25% of the argument. Another 25% (Factorio) is based on no evidence at all. The third 25% is CDPR saying they want Cyberpunk available everywhere. Andddd the fourth 25% is an ex-employee disagreeing with his old boss' decision. \n\nPlease tell me how any of this sounds like an argument worth >30k points and multiple gildings. You're doing nothing but cashing in on reddit's newest circlejerk."}, {"comment_id": "emhuync", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "\n>Rise of Industry, which is currently on Steam, but the company [declined](https://imgur.com/a/CJO1UsR) the deal because they do not believe in restricting player choice.\n\nNo mention of brand damage.\n\n>Factorio is another game that Epic is very likely to have tried to grab as an exclusive. In their latest [developer blog](https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-293), Factorio devs stated that there will be  ''no selling-out to big companies that would use the game as cash grab  while destroying the brand (we actually declined to negotiate  \"investment opportunities\" like this several times already, no matter  what the price would be), the same would be when it would potentially come to any exclusivity deals, which is its own subject... ''\n\nThe only mention of \"brand damage\", and no connection specifically to EGS. Kinda far fetched to extrapolate that.\n\n>Months ago, CD Projekt Red [publicly stated](https://www.gamesradar.com/cyberpunk-2077-wont-be-an-epic-store-exclusive-cd-projekt-red-confirms/) that they are giving any possibility of exclusivity or co-exclusivity for Cyberpunk 2077 a pass on Twitter when asked about their stance.\n\nAs everyone expected them to, no news there. Hell, they have their own store, *of course* they wouldn't sell exclusively on EGS. \n\nThey're not avoiding EGS exclusivity due to \"brand damage\", but just doing their thing as usual. The whole \"CD project red stating obvious things\" praise is getting boring.\n\n>Chris Avellone who used to work at Obsidian, called the Outer World exclusivity deal a [cash grab](https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-outer-worlds/chris-avellone-epic-games-store). He is currently a writer for Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 and stated on twitter that while the game will also launch on EGS, it will not be exclusive because of the importance of player choice.\n\nNow you're just reaching. What a random writer states on Twitter has no effect on what management will decide later closer to release.\n\nOf course some devs have different opinions of EGS and disapprove of it, just as some gamers support it. But making up a \"EGS exclusivity is brand damage\" spin as some kind of common enough opinion is just delusional."}, {"comment_id": "emhtrmr", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "It makes sense, respect and legacy over quick and easy money, good for them"}, {"comment_id": "emi64re", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "Rise of industry is fantastic!

I've NEVER used a default or community scheme I've liked, I always scrap it and make one from scratch.   \n\n\nmaking control schemes is NOT why the steam controller did poorly, let me break it down for you.   \n\n\nValve showed off the steam controller to a very minor extend before its release. Every one was skeptical about its \"emulated\" joy sticks and touch pads in place of said joy sticks. Valve didnt really do anything to ensure people \"yes this will be good, we've been testing the shit out of it and its good!\"   \n\n\nWhat did they do, like always they kept their damn mouths shut and let every one else do the talking for them, surprise, huge mistake.   \n\n\nThe moments these babies where dropped off the UPS trucks they flew in on, the reviewers ATE THAT SHIT UP. They all wanted to know what this new weird controller from the makers of Half Life and Team Fortress was all about and if the change was good or bad or what have you. They all spent like 2 or 3 hours with the thing, tossed it aside and said \"this sucks dick, dont buy it, is good for clicking on shit tho\"   \n\n\nSOOO many problems with this controllers release and all of it can be contributed to Valve not saying a god damn thing and doing zero PR work.   \n\n\n1) You're NOT going to get the hang of this controller in 2 hours, I had to use it for a straight week before It really started to click, I compare it to riding a bike for the first time. After years of muscle memory and comfort gaming with a dual stick controller, this thing will feel awkward as fuck at first and even harder to learn the gyro with the touch pad at the same time. When you do learn how to use it, its a game changer.   \n\n\n2) The fuck'n Gyro was NEVER advertised on this thing. I had been following this controller since they announced it. I was guilty of trying the controller for a few hours and thinking it was kind of a dud, but me along with thousands of other users didnt realize it had motion controls  in it (actually good controls too) and that they take this controller for pc gaming from a meger 4/10 exprience to a fuck'n 10/10 easy (for me anyway). Youtube videos started surfacing about the gyro built into it which helped a lot of people give it another try (my self included) and really get the ball going on this. Valve didnt bother to tell people until this video started getting popular and they put the damn video right up on steam so people could see it, they couldnt even be bothered to make their own fuck'n video.   \n\n\n3) harkening back to the video thing.. Valve NEEDED to demo this fuck'n thing to people and tell them/show them how to use it before sending it out into the wild. I compare this to all the goofy new \"extreme\" sports junk that comes out. When Razer scooters where new, they had those commercial showing off kids do'n sick ass tricks on them. Razer was smart said \"if we want our product to look cool and fun, we gotta show it off being used to its full potential and show kids how cool these things really are and what they can do!\". They got some dumb ass kids, taught them how to use them, turned them into experienced scooter riders (scooterers?), and showed it to the world. Valve didnt do anyt of this shit, valve did this: \"Here is a new scooter, it is metal, it has small wheels, it go fast. enjoy\" and then walked away.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nthe configs have NOTHING to do with why this controller failed. Doesn't help that it was also trying to gain traction in the wake of the Steam Machines which managed to be an even bigger failure so what little success it did have was overshadowed by the Steam Machines massive fuck up because yet again valve didnt want to actually do anything with that, they just wanted to make a gaming OS and drop it into the community like it was going to catch fire or something. Im a Valve fan and all (or used to be more of one anyway) but sometimes they really do some really dumb shit and squander some really good idea on being lazy as fuck."}, {"comment_id": "evln45x", "post_id": "cka890", "comment": "I understand it's not the community's job to develop configs for the controller, but if you look at almost any game now.

Not many want to take the time to learn a new set of skills, most are completely content with using their xbox controllers (or ds4/switch pro) for console ports and similar games made for controllers, and their kbm's for everything else. And main stream reviewers/big name youtubers simply dont have the time to devote to it even if they wanted to learn, considering their job requirements basically mean shoveling out as much content as possible as fast as possible.\n\nWhich is fine. Nothing inherently wrong with that. But it is why so many keep saying the touch pads suck even though they are pretty ace once you've gotten used to them, and definitely contributes to the low adoption rate of the Steam Controller. There are people in this very thread saying that they didnt buy it simply because its not a dual stick controller... so that alone means there is more to it than software.\n\nThat isnt the SC's or Valve's fault though. I think of it more as the SC being ahead of its time, as I hope that one day we'll return to the age where every console generation all manufacturers - not just Nintendo - were pushing the boundaries of input design trying to find something better.

I'm somewhat sympathetic to the exhausting nature of dealing with the player base myself, especially when most of the decisions which upset them are coming down from above and you can't change them, and a tonne of the criticism is outright personally hateful and toxic.\n\n**But that still doesn't excuse not doing the right thing for your playerbase as a whole.**\n\nYou don't rip them off, and accuse them of being entitled and moochers just because you're tired of being a firewall for EA. You don't encourage exploitative practices just because it earns a shit tonne of money for EA.\n\nYou are not a slave. You are not a drone. You still should do what is moral and right because, if you *truly* love gaming you do what is best for *gamers*, irrespective of what Corporate demands you do.\n\nIn my own case, I walked from EA / Broadsword when I spent 10 hours of my free time building a replacement event because the staff had refused to do the set up, then bollocked me for using a piece of land that *nowhere* in the handbook did it say you could not. That I was given a warning for actually trying to give my players the events they deserved.\n\nFuck that. Fuck anything or any one who says you should do what you know to be wrong.\n\nAnd you especially don't lash out at the entire gaming community because of any cognitive dissonance on *your* part about the moral compromises or betrayals you might have engaged in; it's not *their* fault the industry treats them like cattle to be milked and consumed. \n\nAnd you don't judge them all by the most sociopathic and broken individuals within the community either. You don't have to let lunatics drag you down into their own lunacy.\n\nAgain, I understand it can be exhausting; *but you don't become a mirror of that toxicity yourself too.*\n\nAnd for what? [To try and exploit over $200 *in a single season* out of people who the industry has known for more than half a decade or more are likely to be lonely and vulnerable?](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/195806/chasing_the_whale_examining_the_.php)\n\nSo to the developers of Apex Legends I say this; instead of raging and lashing out at people who rightly are angry about your funding model... how about simply refusing to be part of it? You're not walking away from your \"dream job\" if you do, because I rather doubt when you were young and innocent your dream job involved gouging your fellow players for every dollar you could get.\n\nAnd if it *was* your dream to make a tonne of money and fuck the playerbase... you don't get to be angry when they call you out on it either. You aren't *owed respect* for ripping people off, even if you get away with it short term.\n\nDo what is right.

These games are literally ports of old games and I'm required to be online to play them? How ludicrous is that?

Companies were dissatisfied with piracy. Too many pirates and all of them downloading their games, nobody wants to pay. Truth be told, people who pirate games either don't have the money or simply want to try the game before they buy it.\n\nBut no, piracy is bad, it is a problem and should be dealt with swiftly. Enter EA Games, yes that EA Games. Their very best game called Command and Conquer 4: Tiberian Twilight. For some unknown reason they made the game always online. Even for singleplayer campaign you must be always online. Evil pirates would end up destroying their high quality game.\n\nAround the same time Silent Hunter 5 came out with the same system because Tiberian Twilight was such a good idea.\n\nBoth games flopped really bad. It was hilarious to watch legitimate customers who bought the game go berserk on EA. Servers weren't stable so they would go offline all the time.\n\nEA tried to force always online even more with games like Darkspore, Sims City, Battleforge... Darkspore is a rather obscure game that is now impossible to play because it was always online and its servers were shutdown. Despite the fact that you paid for the game there is no way you can play it ever again. Same with Battleforge.\n\nSims City was a whole different story. It was always online (I think it was Sims City or Sims 3, can't remember which one) but it worked like crap. Fan outrage was huge and EA was at risk of losing a huge fanbase. So, to save their asses they completely rewrote the game. Always online system was coded into the game, there was no simple way to just switch it off. They had to purge entire game code in order to make it free of always online.\n\nMeanwhile Ubisoft followed EA and we had Assassin's Creed 2. What was an epic fail was the fact that paying customers couldn't play Assassin's Creed 2 at all because servers were crashing but pirates could without any problem because crack was actually a server emulator. So legal customers started to pirate the game just to be able to play it. Pirated version worked better. In the meantime Ubisoft fixed the servers.\n\nFor some reason Ubisoft continued with this shenanigan while EA backed out a little bit. Sim City was a serious blow to them but Ubisoft bit it like a pitbull. I still remember what a fiasco was HAWX 2.\n\nThe point is, they wanted to screw the pirates but ended up screwing legal customers."}, {"comment_id": "ecmkp2b", "post_id": "a9lntx", "comment": "It's not just shitty practices that have happened and are happening, that we need to open our eyes to, but we need to get rid of the traction all these companies have, as time is moving faster than you realise and these companies are pushing nonstop as fast as they can to make money and take control. The longer we leave it the harder it will be and the more practices we will have to reverse. Before you know it every game could include something crappy, and then your only option will be to submit or to not play anything new again.\n\nSo many games now coming out, basic editions are already so pricey, then you're paying 20 more for skins and some content, and if you want everything you gotta pay another 20-40. And that's for stuff that's made before release, not season pass! Remember when Mass Effect locked a prologue mission before release unless you paid more? People flipped! \"if its made before release it should be included!\" but now that's everywhere, and I guess people will have justification for it now (it's cosmetic, not story, it's just extra areas) to avoid feeling had.\n\nIf that's the case, OP's post is for you especially. You. Have. Been. Had. And that's okay, what matters is that we change things for the better, and that's possible together. You can argue and straw man, or you can simply say \"maybe things could be better\" and don't shut out everything that may affect your reality. Have fun out there!

I much preferred the oldschool MMORPG days where I paid you $10-15 a month and got regular content updates, good support, good service, etc. Thing is, people are cheap nowadays and companies know that regardless of public backlash they can make serious piles of cash off of psychological weakpoints and flaws.\n\nAt the end of the day people can view gaming as an artform, but it also needs to be an economically viable artform for most people. These are still companies and if they want to excel, they need to do what they need to do to survive and prosper. Nobody makes a company to make a single game and call it quits - whoever is behind all this inevitably wants to continue. They want the most profit out of their product as possible.\n\nI think gamers need to wake up and stop getting cozy with the PR/Marketing/Hypesters/Influencers and grow some fucking balls. From clear astroturfing by companies here on Reddit, to streamers and 'influencers' being used to peddle agendas, it's sickening. I'll remind myself to check back here in two months to see if anything changed and I'll publicly admit defeat and apologize to the OP - but I don't see PUBG taking a big hit in player numbers from this in the slightest.

The success of an online arena shooter like CS:GO or PUBG relies completely on the continued support of the Developers, and how do you do that when everyone who want's to purchase the game - has already purchased it? \n\nThere will be a plateau in the sales of PUBG at some point or another - and if people **expect** (and by fucking god people *do expect*) there to be a continued stream of regular updates and new maps then where the fuck is the money going to come from to pay the people working on said updates and maps?\n\nYes - it was stated that paid cosmetic DLC would not be included in the game until it was out of EA. But frankly I see this as nothing but a trial of the Key/Crate system and the viability of it as the game matures and that plateau approaches for the Dev's. If you seriously expected this game to have ZERO paid cosmetic items at all, ever - Then honestly you're fucking delusional.\n\nI see paid cosmetic DLC as a necessary evil. I very rarely drop money on it. I've maybe put \u00a350 into CS:GO despite my over 1000 hours playing it.\n\nI don't argue that there are games that exist that have fucking awful Key/Crate systems.

That motherfucker basically made it seem like spending 200 bucks on a game that cost 20 was no big deal to 10,000 mostly young and impressionable people.\n\nWhere are the reasonable voices?  Where are the voices telling people NOT TO WASTE their money on an item they will completely forget about when the next big game comes along?\n\n\n\nEDIT: BTW calling cosmetics DLC is a bit disingenuous.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dkqqjm3", "post_id": "6pmx25", "comment": "Counterpoint: This is not a $60 game.

This wasn't know to me until having seen the original post from OP on the Discord subreddit. My server and a bunch of other servers could have suddenly been un-partnered due to a lack of communication of the rules. Even my attempts for more clarification were met my confused remarks saying they weren't \"blanket banning\" the word yet this contradicts the previous staff members statements.\n\n My Discord, that of r/drizzy , is devoted to discussion surrounding Drake, a black rapper who frequently uses the term in song lyrics. Yet were not even allowed to quote those lyrics. But why do these song lyrics fall under the terms of \"discriminatory language\" yet these songs are allowed to become extremely popular? It's because they don't. Context matters. That's all we're asking of Discord is to let us as partners be trusted to know when such language is being used negativity. Because 99% of the time that isn't the case. If it's not a \"blanket ban\" of the words then why do the rules state it as such?

Tencent owns 40% of Epic games, making them a huge shareholder in the company. Tencent also happens to be the biggest video game company on the planet. In other words, I'm confident that we're perfectly safe giving our information to a launcher that feeds user info to the Chinese government.\n\nBecause US tech companies have such a good track record with our personal data. /s\n\nSeriously though, if you play any Epic game you've already given them your info. Lol\n\n>2. It is developer and publisher friendly since it gives more of a cut to the devs (Epic's 12% vs Steam's 30% cut). Just ignore the fact that Valve said that it would lower its usual 30 percent take to 25 percent for any game's earnings beyond $10 million (including \"game packages, DLC, in-game sales, and Community Marketplace game fees\"). Or the fact that the platform fee reduces further to 20 percent for earnings that surpass $50 million. In other words, it would only be an 8% difference in profit (And Steam would outsell Epic anyway so it would end up as more profit for the devs and publishers). Just ignore all that.\n\nEpic's rates are still better, and they're far more favorable for small indie devs who won't sell $10 million worth of product. But I guess indie devs getting paid better isn't cool. \n\n>3. Exclusivity is the same as competition, obviously. Letting Metro Exodus sell in multiple stores would be terrible since Epic Games is obviously the superior breed. It would only humiliate everyone else. Steam has been a reliable, well populated, and established distribution platform for too long. Don\u2019t you want to split up that obnoxiously large game library into separate launchers? Just download Epic Games Launcher, and you can play a whole 20+ games! WOW! Plus its got like\u2026 4 exclusives or something. AND F0RTN1T3!@#$\n\nWell this just sounds like someone who wanted to hate on Fortnite lol\n\n>4. Epic Games launcher has amazing benefits to users. 80 million accounts were compromised due to a security \u201cflaw\u201d that allowed hackers to log into accounts without needing a password! This means you get FREE EXPOSURE ONLINE. Get ready to become rich and famous! If you don\u2019t want the free exposure (But why?) just contact customer service. They will get back to you in a measly 5 months or so.\n\nAgain, this can happen with any tech company. Dunno why you're acting like Epic is unique here. \n\n>5. Feature-wise, yes, Steam might have some (tiny) advantages. But it\u2019s nothing important really. Epic Games Launcher is only missing a few things like cloud saves, user profiles, user reviews, friend activity, forums, mod distribution, groups, item trading, library sorting, account sharing, streaming to other devices, broadcasting, screenshot capture/sharing, controller support, user-created guides, wish lists, automatic refunds, achievements, anti-cheat support, 3rd party keys, etc. \n\nThis just in, newer platform has less features. Never knew that would happen. \n\n>Other than that stuff, it\u2019s pretty much Steam but better.\n>\n>6. You can\u2019t play games offline on Epic Games Launcher! I mean, why would you want to anyway? It\u2019s not like offline games are worth playing anyway unless you\u2019re online. I\u2019m confident Metro Exodus will be vastly more fun when you\u2019re online vs offline.\n\nGot a source for this?\n\n>7. Their refund policy is EXACTLY like Steam. Except it\u2019s not automatic, you have to go on a browser and go to their website, contact customer support, and wait 5 months. Oh, and they can refuse refunds even if you meet the criteria.\n\nGot any source on this \"you have to wait 5 months\" claim?\n\n>Conclusion:\n>I hope I shed some light on why Epic Games Launcher is a superior, feature-rich, and a totally-not-anti-consumer launcher.\n>\n>[Source](https://steamcommunity.com/app/412020/discussions/0/1780513643844913935/)\n\nLOL.

PNGs is not natively supported.\n\n>Windows 8 imports JPEGs at 85% quality.  PNG is natively supported and is imported at full fidelity.\n\n>Windows 10 imports JPEGs at 85% quality unless you use this override.  PNG is natively supported and is imported at full quality.  The override registry value is literally handled as an integer and is capped at 0n100 / 0x64.  If you set it to anything higher, it'll simply be set to 100%.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd I decided to do some investigating myself on Windows 10: \n\nTo assess for quality changes, three images were compared, using [this file](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AoM_t3wwJ-YsgQDecXCYWZpN47t9) (It's ugly, I know): \n\n* The original PNG image (1434 KB)          \n* A screenshot of the desktop (1394 KB)\n* The Windows \u201cTranscodedWallpaper\u201d file (1540 KB)\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe visual comparison of selected areas can be [seen here:](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AoM_t3wwJ-YsgQrvUH0W_KL9fgyk) \n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nAs you can see, there are no differences between each file whatsoever; thus, Windows does **NOT** compress PNG files when saved as a wallpaper. [Compare this to the quality loss when using JPG files.](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AoM_t3wwJ-YsgQn29sH8mA2dg2VD) \n\nu/Hambeggar rightly stated that Windows saves a cached file at the resolution of the desktop, as \u201cCachedImage_{DWidth}_{DHeight}_POS4.jpg. \n\n[A quick look at the Hex data with HxD](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AoM_t3wwJ-YsgQ8NHXT1J0wXBbiw) shows that while the extension is JPG, the file is still encoded as a PNG; thus no conversion has occurred. Similarly, checking [HxD for the TranscodedWallpaper file](https://1drv.ms/i/s!AoM_t3wwJ-YsgQ7cv0UL9rRUThQl) also shows it encoded as PNG. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nA few more answers before the questions get asked: \n\n* The filesize discrepancy between the PNG base file and transcodedwallpaper file is nullified by resaving the transcodedwallpaper as a new PNG. It then matches the base file size, so the difference is probably due to Microsoft using different metadata or a different saving algorithm \u2013 I have no idea. \n* The same rules apply for images larger than the desktop resolution - with the exception that files greater than 5760x3240 will be resized to that resolution before saving as TranscodedWallpaper.\n* If you have Theme sync turned on in Windows 10, Windows saves a JPEG anyway (so that less bandwidth is used over their servers) and uses that roaming image as the wallpaper. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "djogkkt", "post_id": "6kry64", "comment": ">Restart your computer\n\nDo what now?"}, {"comment_id": "djoev6s", "post_id": "6kry64", "comment": "Man, for months now I've been wondering if my wallpapers have been \"deteriorating\".

You do not need to log into a server to access your save file or your DLC purchases.\n\nMicro-transactions, as described above are inherently harmful in all paid games that would presumably be playable offline (so NOT like Apex/Overwatch for example, which run entirely on real dedicated servers and need other human players for 95% of the game). Whether they are cosmetic or mechanical is an additional factor that can definitely make it worse, but that is not the key component that makes micro-transactions bad, or more specifically [what makes 'games as a service\" bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUAX0gnZ3Nw).\n\nWe'll have to see more to know whether or not Borderlands 3 is an online-required game as a service. If a portion of the content is locked online like that, unlike the past 3 borderlands games which were playable offline, then Randy is indeed lying. If the cosmetic additions are structured as DLCs, purchasable individually on the steam or epic store, then he is CORRECT in saying that aren't micro-transactions.\ufeff\n\nDLCs allow you to purchase/download and play the whole experience offline forever (for as long as Steam is alive, or if cracks exist beyond that). That also has a HUGE impact on future pricing. Since micro-transactions are not visible on any storefronts, they rarely if EVER discount those unlocks. You'd be extremely hard pressed to find a \"Complete Edition\" of a game that includes the old micro-transactions, so even if the game is 7 years old and has been repackaged multiple times and is all the way down to $3-10, often the internal micro-transactions still require an online account and will still be full price, making the true cost of the experience anywhere from $50-10,000."}, {"comment_id": "emdndb5", "post_id": "bjsu6x", "comment": "I have no problem with microtransactions as long as they're purely aesthetic.

I guess they're hoping at that point they'll have enough of a library and be popular enough for devs to stay.

It's reminding me that being a scumbag dev isn't limited to the AAA devs. Smaller indie devs can be scumbags too. And I suppose they will have to thank Epic too one day for dividing gamers and devs even moreso than they were, because whereas I and a lot of people used to defend them and advocate against buying on grey market key resellers, because they screwed over devs, now we aren't so enthusiastic. It's still a bad idea, because these sellers can screw over consumers as well, but it's getting to the point where that's really the only reason. At least any dev that goes exclusive to Epic deserves to be in the same boat as companies like EA or Activision as far as I am concerned.\n\nThere's some real greed going on there, but it isn't steam's cut. It's pretty common knowledge that there are plenty of other alternatives that take a better cut, and you can even sell steam keys on many of them and Valve would take none of the cut and users could still be enticed because these keys once activated work just like a game bought directly on steam. But if the cut was such a big reason, they would have been seen as honest if they were selling only on stores that offered a better cut that they preferred. Fact of the matter is, most devs chose not to sell on just Humble Store, or on just Itch.io. If they sold on these stores it was in addition to steam. That many epic exclusives advertised ON steam (and frequently that was the only place I ever saw them) right up until they were yanked off should make any claim that they were afraid of being \"buried\" clearly bullshit. Fact of the matter is that you generally wouldn't advertise exclusively on a platform where you never made any sales.\n\nAnybody saying that Valve didn't earn their fair share clearly have no idea of how any of this works. Again, devs were using Steam right up until the exclusivity deals, and the fact that these deals are temporary, after which they will be sold on steam and other stores shows that these devs don't truly believe that Valve hasn't earned the 30% cut when sold directly on steam. If something wasn't worth paying for, you generally wouldn't pay for it. You would take your money or product elsewhere, but these devs had to be bribed for exclusivity rather than doing so naturally, they never took their game to itch.io which has been stated to be developer friendly. Despite itch taking as low as 0% of the cut, developers seemed to understand that if they wanted the most money, that selling exclusivedly on itch would not be the answer. Nope, they took it to the store that is particularly anti-consumer after being bribed. That makes them liars.\n\nSo then there's Epic and Valve. I think it's pretty obvious that Epic is able to ask for such a low cut because A.) the experience they are offering is so barebones that users get absolutely nothing from buying compared to piracy. Furthermore, all of the costs have been pushed onto consumers themselves, and despite the lower cut, most games are not cheaper, in fact, most of the time consumers are finding them more expensive. So if Valve were to lower the cut to Epic's levels, they would likely either need to A.) reverse decision. B.) reduce the quality and amount of services they provide, pushing more of the costs onto consumers, or C.) get money from elsewhere, such as an investment from some huge chinese corporation, or a buyout. \n\nThis would probably destroy them and would absolutely devastate the PC gaming market. Valve isn't backed by a huge chinese corporation like Epic is. What Epic and their shills have been trying is to discredit everything Valve has and is doing for consumers and developers. They want to divide consumers and developers more and more. Gaming media has consistently shown a disdain for gamers, to the point that they instinctively will side with anything that gamers don't like. \n\nAnd they seem convinced that Epic will win purely because they see consumers as stupid. So they want you and everybody else to just give up, regardless of what happens to pc gaming. Maybe they are right, that most gamers don't care about the quality of service or of the quality of a product, but the recent resurgence in piracy suggests otherwise. If a dev cares about sticking around for the next few years, it is probably a good idea not to buy into short term bribes, because it's possible that this will come back to bite any dev that takes Epic and Tencent's money. \n\nAnd to those that think this is a good thing because Steam is some kind of monopoly. You really need to ask yourself why you're supporting Epic of all companies. Valve may not be no David, but Epic is most definitely a Goliath. They aren't a small business, and they are backed by one of China's largest corporations, particularly the one that is responsible for massive censorship on the Chinese government's behalf. More than just following the laws of the land, they practically are melded to be one and the same with the government. In other words, you could easily consider Epic to be funded and controlled by the Chinese government. And as much as Tim Sweeney would like you to believe that he can keep them away, it's still a deal with the devil, and can easily come back to bite him."}, {"comment_id": "eizb24e", "post_id": "b3g0ne", "comment": "Yeah I won't be buying Epic Games client"}, {"comment_id": "eiztlcu", "post_id": "b3g0ne", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "ebx7h94", "post_id": "a6qv4y", "comment": "If you watch the Dev stream where they showed the making of the trailer they talk about her they wanna go back to halo 1 and capture that feeling and wonder, "}, {"comment_id": "ebx3ygu", "post_id": "a6qv4y", "comment": "They've said it before.

They've done that in collusion with a partner monitor manufacturer that makes some expensive Freesync and gsync monitors.\n\ni.e, they've tested 400 but only 12 were good enough? Is just saying \"We tested your freesync monitors and they were shit\" followed by here's a small list of expensive monitors you should have purchased \"....\" i.e acer and asus are going to get a few sales by colluding with nvidia's disingenuous press release.\n\nAs an end user with a rejected freesync monitor you're supposed to now believe you cheaped out and should have either bought an expensive freesync or expensive gsync monitor. Whereas, in reality you probably got a perfectly good monitor.\n\nAnd, of course since all the gsync monitors are up to snuff (according to Nvidia) then they hope you will conclude it's a no-brainer to buy a Gsync monitor because in the same way they convinced fuckwits to spend more on power supplies as though the electricity is better, they'll hope you'll be convinced to spend more on a monitor.\n\nEnd result, a story that appears to be suggesting they support freesync, is really trying to persuade you that Gsync is superior and you should buy a nvidia card.\n\nI'll bet 3 packets of hobnobs that those with freesync monitors that were rejected will enable the option on in the driver options and and it'll be shit for some reason which they will then conclude is the fault of their inferior monitor.\n\nPersonally speaking I got a gtx1070 and a freesync monitor (Samsung curved one, not sure of the model) because the whole variable refresh rate thing is a crock of shit. I want 144 fps in my games not 40fps. If I was going to spend more money because my game ran like shit I would get a gtx1080 or better, not a monitor that costs \u00a3200 more that tries to hide how slow a game is.\n\nAnd that's why I bought a reasonably priced 144hz monitor rather than paying the \u00a3150-200 excess for gsync.\n\nNvidia make decent graphics cards and, sadly, AMD are fuckwits and don't, but nvidia come out with a lot of bullshit PR - and that's exactly what this is designed to be."}, {"comment_id": "edgj6ne", "post_id": "adens7", "comment": "So, I have a G2590PX, and the link says they'll support the G2590FX.

GTA V has not released any substantial content for single player since release, and they gate off all the added online content from being used in single player, all the way down to the vehicles they have added. My guess is someone at T2 saw a mod pack that  imported all the previously online-only vehicles into single player, and decided that forcing the single players into the online ecosystem for cash-milking was the best move for their bottom line. Greed is always short-sighted. This is not going to push single players into online, its going to make them stop playing entirely, and not buying future games released by rockstar or T2 most likely. On top of that you have an internet bonfire ready to roast T2 AND Rockstar, probably blazing already as we speak.

Can't they just credit them?**\n\nSkyrim script extender (SKSE) is a framework, It's a very well made mod that adds utility and functionality for other modders to create their own mods, It's a cornerstone of practically the entire modding community. Take a quick look at Nexus mods; there are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of mods developed for Skyrim. And a very large percentage of them are compatible with each other because they use SKSE's tools, and follow SKSE's rules.\n\nThe developers of Skyrim Together previously worked on a very similar project called \"SkyrimOnline\" For complicated reasons, it was discontinued and rebranded a couple years later. Skyrim Online was essentially created entirely from stolen SKSE code, which we just discussed is a huge no-no. Giving credit isn't good enough because in order for the entire community to keep working like it does, it requires that everyone respect the SKSE license.\n\nSo the SKSE team (after some heated arguments, and insanely immature behavior from the SkyrimOnline team) decided to *specifically prohibit* the SkyrimOnline team from using their code in any capacity in the actual license of their software.\n\nFast forward a couple years and Skyrim Together was \"created\" to shorten a lot of bullshit, essentially it's composed of the same team as Skyrim Online, and they they were still stealing code from SKSE, just under a different name. Except this time they're making a shit-ton of money off it.\n\nThey quickly went sort of quiet after they where exposed, after a bit they made a statement saying they are going to remove all the SKSE code, and claimed it was \"legacy code\" anyway. Essentially claiming that the code wasn't being utilized in any way, but hadn't been removed yet. And ever sense they've said relatively little, besides this apparently.\n\n*\\*Speculation warning\\**\n\nI don't think it was legacy code, in fact I'd go as far as saying that \"Skyrim Together\" was literally just \"Skyrim Online\" with a new name, and they where hoping that no one would notice. I think SKSE's code is so integral to the mod's functionality, that removing it would require them to basically start over from nothing. And that they are trying to find a way to weasel out of this, because they know they fucked up big time.\n\n**Nobody bought the mod, it was all donations, so they can't get in legal trouble.**\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, that's where it gets a little weird. You see, no public version of the mod was ever released. *However,* If you \"donated\" a dollar or more to the patron you where given access to the closed beta. This makes things a little more complicated. The patron is promising the delivery of a specific product, and by \"donating\" you receive access to a version of that product immediately. Furthermore you only needed to donate once for access, until they pulled the close beta that is.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI believe there is precedent for something like this being considered a \"purchase\" and not a \"donation\". They where 100% Using patron as the means to distribute a product in exchange for money. With the added benefit that some fools may stay subscribed and they'd get even more money.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can't just **call** something a \"donation\" and treat it like a purchase and expect to get away with it, that's not how it works. If it really is a donation, you have to treat the exchange like a donation, and I truly believe they did not. This is significant because it may turn Bethesda's eye towards them, previously all they've done is upset the community and be asshats about everything, but very soon they could find themselves out of the frying pan and into the fire if Bethesda decides it's worth their time. And considering the amount of \"\"\"donations\"\"\" they have been collecting (18K-30K a month for at least 5 months) I think it could very well be.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFurthermore, the devs tried really hard not to advertise this, even their patreaon says they're \"making video games\" and not \"making mods\" or something more accurate. In fact the only way I learned about it was from users on the subreddit, and even they where a little crytpic about how to get access to to closed beta. To me, this only lends even more credence to the idea that they absolutely knew they where violating Bethesda's TOS, and potentially the law.\n\nAnyway that's thats the shortest I can explain what's going on here, If I got something wrong please let me know, I know I missed a ton but there simply isn't space to put everything.\n\nI think the Dev's are tying to save their asses and duck out of this whole situation before it gets too big to just walk away from."}, {"comment_id": "eltvz2g", "post_id": "bhkyhb", "comment": "> As pointed out in the response to that comment, the community around the mod is still contributing more than $18,000 per month to the development process via Patreon\n\nlol. they really do not owe anything. /s maybe they should start giving the money back if they want to be left alone?"}, {"comment_id": "eltxbze", "post_id": "bhkyhb", "comment": "Technically?

If Epic were to try to run a launch a storefront like Ubisoft, EA, or Blizzard, they'd have *maybe* 3 titles. Here are the games Epic has made in the last 20 years ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_games_by_Epic_Games)):\n\n* Fortnite\n* Shadow Complex Remastered\n* Unreal Tournament\n* ~~Robo Recall~~ VR Only\n* ~~Gears of War series~~ (published by Microsoft)\n* ~~Infinity Blade series~~ (Mobile)\n* ~~Bulletstorm~~ (published by EA)\n\nFunny enough, they actually put out Shadow Complex Remastered for free as a way to get people to download the Epic Games Launcher back in late 2015.\n\nDon't get me wrong, their work on the Unreal Engine has been impressive and we've seen a ton of great games made with Unreal, but Epic themselves don't really have a great library.\n\n> at some point, the industry will move down and match us (in terms of Epic\u2019s 12% cut of sales.)\n\nI doubt it. Steam will probably move down a little bit but honestly Steam offers way more for their 30% cut. Things like discussion forums, Steam Workshop, Community Hubs, the newly released API to help protect players from DDoS attacks and help with NAT traversal, etc.\n\nOn top of that they offer tools for managing developer pages, managing store listings and pricing, etc. I'm not sure what EGS offers by comparison but I doubt developers have more control over their store listings than they do on Steam.\n\nMaybe I'm a bit too bullish on Steam but other than the free games, Epic's moves have been incredibly anti-consumer.\n\n> Sweeney noted that the company\u2019s \u201cup-front investments in exclusives and free games are significant and may exceed net profits from third-party games in 2019.\u201d\n\nI wouldn't be surprised. If the statements are true that Epic is effectively guaranteeing revenue (either by sales or by compensation when sales fall below expectations) then they're making some pretty strong bets that people will buy from EGS rather than wait for the game to come out on Steam. I think we're seeing a bit of that in the 6-month window for Borderlands 3. I'm betting that a full year is more than Epic was willing to pay for.\n\nWe'll see - by their own admission they already underestimated the reaction to the Metro: Exodus exclusivity. I'm curious if that goes further and they underestimated their own ability to woo buyers away from Steam. \n\nThey already have *some* data at this point. I wouldn't be surprised they stay aggressive through the rest of the year and then adjust their plan next year depending on how well the exclusives end up doing."}, {"comment_id": "ek31t8d", "post_id": "b93ydb", "comment": "I'm going to continue not buying Epic store games\n\nr/patientgamers "}, {"comment_id": "ek3d3ww", "post_id": "b93ydb", "comment": "Interesting to see Epic supporting the return of piracy."}, {"comment_id": "ek3hufx", "post_id": "b93ydb", "comment": "Epic, I used to like you a lot.

The competition part would be which store front offers the services as a consumer I need. Epic doesn't even begin to scratch that surface so I would not buy from them plain and simple. I have bought games off Epic in the past 1st party, there MOBA game that was in EA and support them and enjoyed the Unreal series but from a consumer stand point I find their latest tactics to be anti consumer as well as a CEO who's pretty hypocritical if you listed to his past rants in regards to Windows Store or even Steam. \n\nBased on the above title it shows their disdain and arrogance towards the consumer which I'm not willing to support. Yeah people are loyal but they have a right to be as Steam has done a lot in 15 years. All these wanna be stores want in without having had put any effort into it. They have not earned or deserve our loyalty. And to prove i'm not biased here I bought the division 2 off Ubisoft store. Why? Because over the years they made their store front non intrusive via steam and it works well today and it's a first party title which makes sense and they don't fuck me over by not allowing it to work with the Steam overlay so I add it as a non steam game while still having access to my library, friends, etc.  Ubisoft has earned some loyalty back from the Ubisoft of old.

If they don't develop or adopt a new engine soon, they'll be at a technological disadvantage from other studios using modern game engines. \n\nLet's compare Fallout 4 with RDR2 and the Witcher 3. They all aim to bring an immersive, open world experience for the player.\n\nFrom a technological standpoint; TW3 and RDR2 are well optimized, have an impressive amount of detail, expansive and actually immersive worlds, and beautiful graphics in textures, shadows, physics, lighting etc.\n\nFallout 4? Total fucking opposite. Runs like a child with one leg, graphics looks like they're from 2010, barely any detail by comparison, and has a tiny map that feels empty.\n\nYou can't not convince me that the engine is the main culprit behind this.

F1 is what really got me into gaming seriously, buying it pretty much on a whim and getting super hooked at age 13. \n\nFallout 2 was coming out close to Christmas where I live, and it\u2019s still to this day the only time I\u2019ve ever looked for a Christmas gift \u2014 or any kind of gift \u2014 ahead of maybe getting it. I did and I loved it. \n\nWhen Fallout 3 was coming out I was VERY hesitant to buy it. I ended up doing it, but I played maybe 10 hours and then quit it for years. Ended up finishing it maybe 5 years later. I really couldn\u2019t accept how much Bethesda had ruined what Fallout was for me. \n\nImmersion. Feels. Meaningfulness. \n\nWhat we got with Fallout 3 was a really mediocre FPS shooter with crappy \u2014 and compared to what was to me the true Fallout experience \u2014 RPG elements. Story nor characters didn\u2019t make up for it at all. I was nauseated. \n\nWhen New Vegas came out it decided to give it a shot, because I still believed the devs stemming from Black Isle still could tell a good story with another Fallout game. They could. FNW is by far the best Fallout game since F2 when it comes to story, characters, environment and general feeling to the game. But it was still pretty ugly, both visually and mechanically. \n\nWith Fallout 4 it was really more of the same. A lousy story (who really gave a shit about Shaun?), the same constraining engine and meh gunplay. \n\nAll of this is still present in Fallout 76. I actually bought it, because one of my gaming friends was interested in playing it together. I watched some streams and decided that it might just be the most Falouty game since Fallout 2... and now, after playing it for a bit, I actually think it is. \n\nIt\u2019s an exploration game. No lousy, imposing story. Just picking a direction and walk. A Fallout themed generic survival game with resource gathering, crafting and base building. \n\nI feel okay with it. I\u2019d still prefer better fighting mechanics and such, but that\u2019s true for PUBG, Arc and all other similar games I\u2019ve tried. \n\nSo... the best thing Bethesda could to to Fallout at this point was stop trying to make a Fallout game. I don\u2019t think they\u2019ll be able to do a proper Fallout game ever, and for the franchise to really shine again they need to sell it off or give another studio the reigns and just be happy with staying on as publisher.

But I won't let someone spit in my face to get one. I like the Metro series.

If you cannot hold those positions as separate from each other, maybe you should work on that. Because, you know, there *are* other stores out there from which I would definitely purchase Exodus (as soon as Denuvo is gone) from. Like Steam and GOG.\n\nBut if I am only of interest to you if I subject myself to a certain store, then, well, as said: I think your opinion of gamers isn't particularly high, and maybe you should work on that before dismissing us as not worthwhile.\n\n> I firmly know that almost everyone who pours this dirt on the net is also incapable of a bit of what we have done and hopefully do more.

This is about the way we'll conduct business in the future, how we see ourselves as customers, and that frankly is more important to me than a single title. I do hope I'll get to play Metro Exodus one day, because even from that rant, it is clear that a lot of people poured heartblood into it - but it will be on conditions where I feel valued as a customer instead of being borderline forced with things like emotional blackmail (\"What do they care about Metro if they refuse to buy it from Epic?\").\n\nI bought both games on Steam, and then re-bought them as Redux because I felt the devs deserve the money.

Should bring his message across, I've used slang whenever he did to keep the mood of the original message**\n----\n\nI watched the seething. My opinion is divided. On one hand, leaving Steam is ambiguous, nobody has ever done it that harshly *(rapidly - translator's note)* before (as far as I can tell). This is new, and therefore it could cause rejection. And a move like this means that one has to install the Epic Launcher, which could provide certain inconveniences for the players, therefore causing discontent.\n\nOn the other hand, the reaction of a certain category of players (\"only torrents\" and stuff like this) - is hardly adequate. The impression arises that people didn't want to play, but just waited for the right moment to pour out their bile. So, basically, we (developers) tried hard and painfully for years to create something special, but a certain category of players thinks that it isn't even worth the few minutes it takes to install the launcher. Naturally, this is their right, but what to they care for Metro then? Obviously, they don't. I can only say, that they weren't our players *(in the sense of \" weren't our fans\" - tn)*, our work doesn't interest them, and therefore in return their opinion doesn't interest me. What reason is there for me (and not only for me) to listen to their opinion?\n\nBut! Let's take a deeper look at the situation. Somebody is saying, that by shitting on Exodus (and the previous games of the series along the way), he will make the world a better place, because he will show the greedy developers their place. To that I can answer, that at the very least, if all PC players start boycotting Metro, then if the next Metro comes out, it definitely will not be on PC. For better or for worse, decide for yourself. I personally will feel sorry for the die-hard fans, yes. But this won't change my, my friends' and my colleagues' opinion. I know for sure, that all who pour all this dirt on the internet *(shit on the game - tn)*, are not capable of doing even a small part of what we did and what we, I hope, will do *(I think he's talking about how people from the Internet can't develop games, and they can - tn)*. Therefore - they are clueless as to what they are talking about.\n\nAnd then. Even though I've beaten every level of every game iunno how many times when developing it, I'm still interested in playing Metro. I've beaten previous parts *(games - tn)* completely and not only once, and right now I'm planning to play completely play through the PC version, which we have just updated with the finishing touches. For me, this is a tradition, and I always replay games completely before release. This helps me evaluate the completed work. Why am I saying this? I'm remembering the words of the Prof *(Andrew \u2018Prof\u2019 Prokhorov, Creative Director and co-founder of 4A - thanks to the people in comments - tn)*, which I've heard from him both myself and on the Internet - you have to make the game for yourself, that it should be fun in the first place to you. And only now I'm starting to understand this fully - no brainiac *(guy who is full of himself and thinks he's clever - tn)* will make me doubt myself as to how much the work we did is worth. But they always will be pissed."}, {"comment_id": "eflhc5d", "post_id": "ame0x3", "comment": "Are they serious? first they screw over the consumers and now they are trying to blackmail us?

A lot of nuance is just gone otherwise\n\nI kept an eye on the murmurs. I\u2019m of two opinions about it. On the one hand, withdrawing from steam is pretty murky territory, no one\u2019s ever done it so suddenly (as far I can tell). It\u2019s new, so it can cause discomfort. And it\u2019s true that this means it\u2019ll be necessary to install epic\u2019s launcher to install the game, which can be inconvenient for gamers and thus make them dissatisfied.\n\nOn the other hand, the reaction of a certain subset of gamers (everyone torrent it and so on...) isn\u2019t exactly reasonable. It leaves the impression that those people didn\u2019t even want to play the game, they were simply waiting for a chance to vent their vitriol. So it lead to a situation where we (the devs) worked our asses off for years, made sacrifices, tried to make something truly special, but a certain category of gamers think so low of this work that they can\u2019t even be bothered to take a few minutes to install a launcher. Naturally, it\u2019s their life and they have a right to do as they will, but then what do they care for Metro at all? It seems clear that they\u2019re not interested in it. I can only say that they weren\u2019t our gamers, that this game we made didn\u2019t interest them, which means that I should correspondingly not concern myself with their opinions. What\u2019s the point of me (specifically speaking for myself) listening to their opinions?\n\nHowever, let\u2019s consider the situation a bit deeper. Some might say that by trash talking Exodus and the other games in the series, they\u2019re making the world a better place, as in they put greedy devs in their place. To this, I can say that if the extreme case happens and all PC gamers end up boycotting Metro, then if there will be a next metro it certainly won\u2019t be on PC. Whether this will be for the better or worse is up to people to decide for themselves. Personally, I\u2019d feel sorry for the devoted fans. However, my, my friends, and my colleague\u2019s opinions won\u2019t change that fact. I have no doubt that practically everyone trash talking on the internet couldn\u2019t make even a fraction of what we\u2019ve made, and hopefully will keep making. They don\u2019t really know what they\u2019re talking about.\n\nAlso, despite the fact that during development I\u2019ve gone through each and every level of the game god knows how many times, I still find Metro interesting to play. I\u2019ve played the previous games fully, and intend to play through the final PC release that we\u2019re adding the last bits and pieces into right now. For me it\u2019s almost a tradition at this point, I always play through a game fully just before release. It helps me appreciate the results of our work. There\u2019s a reason I\u2019m talking about this. I\u2019m remembering Prof\u2019s (Andrey Prohorov) words which I\u2019d heard from him personally and seen referenced on the internet \u2013 people should make games for themselves, they must first and foremost like what they\u2019ve made. It\u2019s only now that I\u2019m starting to fully appreciate what that\u2019s about. No smartass will change my appreciation for what we\u2019ve made.

That doesn't mean BioWare and EA shouldn't be taken to task for releasing the most unfinished game in recent memory after fallout 76.

If it wasn't for Respawn being beasts and making a smash hit with Apex Legends, EA would likely be flailing right now. As it stands, AL will probably keep the company from changing for at least a year or two.\n\nGod I wish EA would either die or hit such financial hardship that they massively reorient to be pro-consumer.

So when Bathesda plays off of the well known MAGA slogan of the president with Make America Nazi Free Again, for their game about killing nazis, people on the right see that as a dig against them and an implication that Trump and people who support him are nazis; and if you go way down the rabbit hole, that violence against them is something Bethesda is hinting at tongue in cheek.

When you link it to politics in anyway people are going to get upset and assume things they otherwise wouldn't.

I bet you didn't bash Rockstar for the crappy online mode for GTA 5 at launch when it was unplayable or for the microtransactions and I'm more than certain you didn't bash CDPR when they heavily downgraded W3, when they promised modkits but delivered nothing, poor employee treatment or when they evaded taxes for years using a fake Cypprus address because the internet herd sees them as the good guys, right?\n\nMaybe start using your brain a bit more, OP.

Regional pricing was such a gift. \n\n\n10 years back when piracy was prominent in many countries like ours the 2 problems were that many games just weren't available and the other problem was that the games that were available were too expensive considering our economical positions. A lot of people who don't understand why piracy was so rampant in so many countries don't understand these 2 issues that were there.\n\n\nRight now, steam and other stores make games available globally so one issue has been tackled. The other problem was also tackled thanks to regional pricing. But now, like you have said so many companies are removing this and making games really expensive for people like us. I wouldn't be amazed if piracy levels skyrocket globally(I mean in countries where these companies are pricing their games much higher than before). Rather than look at games like Witcher 3 that don't have DRM and priced really well on Steam, that game did really well (because it was affordable) despite piracy risks due to lack of DRM,  game publishers will instead just say PC gamers pirate games for no reason and keep putting PC gaming down.\n\n\nI will mostly not pirate any of these games as I am satisfied with the games I have that I have not finished yet but I wouldn't blame anyone for doing so with these reasons. If you are just pirating them even when you have money and access to them then you are scum. Most people I know who have pirated these games because of real issues blocking them from buying them leagally, have gone on and purchased those very games when they reached an economically better position in their life(yes, they bought them despite having finished games and will most likely not touch a lot of them after buying them since they have finished it)"}, {"comment_id": "ehk0svm", "post_id": "aw4eui", "comment": "I think it's very sad, and not to mention that it's all digital and it's at the same price as the physical game, really these companies will end up destroying both the steam trade and the community in Brazil and the world."}, {"comment_id": "ehkhbz6", "post_id": "aw4eui", "comment": "Also to remember this is not only for PC/Console gaming.

I honestly love the concept of a game getting a stream of content over time. But this makes piracy harder.\n\n\nWhat's funny, is that \"early access\" Indies seem to catch me more often then anything. Rimworld is probably the fastest I have ever reached 400 hours played. And Kenshi is...what even is it? \n\nI almost wonder if it's time to force a gaming \"recession\". It will hurt the big companies, and suck for their employees, but small studios with acceptable pricing will flourish. Maybe this leads to more studios like chucklefish.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "ehks0to", "post_id": "aw4eui", "comment": "Wait DoA6 is costing you that fucking much?

Like all other Ubisoft games, it had a lot of marketing behind it, which inherently gains more sales due to larger outreach. That's kind of the point of marketing, anyway. For being the worst game company, they always sell a shitload of copies of their titles\n2. It was a new IP that had a lot of hype behind it because it was something that people hadn't seen before, plus the premise was interesting because it had a pseudo-wish fulfillment type of thing going for it for the people who wanted to play out the \"Who Would Win\" fights they had thought about since they were kids\n3. It had a totally unique combat system that intrigued a lot of people, and so garnered even *more* interest. People who may not have normally been interested in a simple 3rd person combat game may have started paying attention because it promised something totally new.\n\nHowever, When people got their hands on it, they realized, oh shit, it's pretty much a fighting game. Lots of people did not know this going into it, and were either turned off by it or couldn't be arsed to learn it to keep up with everyone else (and rightfully so in a lot of cases, since the genre wasn't entirely clear going in). \n\nTo the last issue, fighting games *always* have a huge dropoff after initial release, more so than other types of games. This is mostly due to the main draw of the games being competitive modes that require time and effort to compete in. Lots of people cannot or will not spend the time to improve, so the games tend to get dropped in favor of games that are either not inherently competitive or that require less time investment. So when a fighting game has a huge amount of people purchasing that would normally never purchase a fighting game *plus* ultra-inflated numbers because of the points mentioned above, the numbers would obviously tend to drop even sharper than they otherwise would. \n\nNot helping the case to keep players it the fact that the combat system has an *enormous* learning curve, especially compared to other fighting games. Most fighting games tend to play similarly, or at least similarly enough to some other past iteration or franchise that learning the basics is a pretty simple matter. The depth comes in when you start to pick up on game-specific mechanics or match-ups. \n\nFor Honor had this problem twice over: it has a totally unique control system that is different to any other game *and* the match-ups between different characters and their very specific movesets matter just as much as they do in other fighting games. Unfortunately, the price for not learning the control system and match-ups is typically swift and humiliating defeat, which would obviously turn people off pretty quick, unless they had the desire to learn and improve.\n\nAnd, of course, you have the issue of balance and technical issues. While balance is argued enough to be almost a moot point (even still), the technical issues were still something to be concerned about. Disconnects, groups failing to join, inability to join matches, all of these things would drive off even more people than the game already had by simply existing in its current form even if it worked flawlessly. I bring this up last because I think this is (totally IMO) the smallest contributor in losing the playerbase. I simply cannot believe that occasional (YMMV) technical issues would be the reason that so much of the playerbase left when you take into all of the non-broken things that would have done it faster and more completely. I can definitely get into the mindset of someone who thinks \"It's going to take me a shit ton of time to learn how to play this game anyway and the game just disconnected me, I have better things to do\" and head off to something else.\n\nFor what it's worth I think (technical issues aside), For Honor is a fucking great game when you are learning and playing it without any major technical issues, which I guess I am lucky to have as the majority of my experience. As someone who has \"survived\" the exodus away from the title and continues to play it almost daily, I don't think I'm getting tired of it anytime soon.

Even the semi-randomly generated maps in the underground were great - and good idea too.   \nSadly, Ubisoft ruined that game entirely.   \nAs mentioned, the bullet sponginess of enemies just kept increasing. New stuff was slow to come in and badly needed bug fixes were months late (despite constant promises by the community devs).   \nHackers (and the lying by ubi that accompanied the entire thing) was also shocking - early in beta there were hackers and lots and lots of people raised hacking as a major issue and ubi promised, litereally made a promise saying it will be addressed, there will be anti hack systems and so on. This was 100% lie - as hacks that worked in beta worked 100% perfectly on launch. The community devs kept lying though - nah it's working, nah we are banning people and other such bullshit that everyone else could easily tell was bullshit (also mpgh forums had proof).   \nThe division could have been great - the game was fun and very very well made. It just needed a tiny bit of dev love - proper anti hacks, prompt bug fixes and minor gameplay tweaks (proper solution to bullet sponge enemies) and occasional balance tweaks.   \nIt got none of that.  \nInstead it got a team of inept wannabie streamers (who streamed with known hackers) working as \"community managers\" whose job involved once a week having a stream where they would mournfully nod and say \"yes, we acknowledge your concerns and we are definitely, this time, again, for sure, totally, still, bringing this to the attention of the developers\" - this bullshit went on for months (maybe still does? i gave up long time ago).\n   \nSo thanks ubi for ruining a great game that could have been even better if you kept the original coding team and let them polish up a few small things post-launch.

Four points in particular were very comforting to hear as they clearly communicated that Bethesda wanted to implement it in a way that accounted for the existing mod communities: \n\n1. Having to \"apply\" to join the Paid Mods Club with a resum\u00e9 of previous mods or game dev experiences meant that modders *had* to create good, free mods to even be allowed to sell later mods they then made. This was good because it specifically would grow the free mod selection in quantity and quality in tandem with paid mods' growth.     \n2. I cannot find the particular wording, but there was a point that explicitly mentioned authors not being allowed to simply remake an existing mod of theirs for the Paid Mods Club; it had to be original work. This meant that paid mods cannibalizing the selection of free mods would be limited, which was not only good, but very necessary for coexistence.   \n3. The promise that mods from the paid mods would be as well integrated into the game as DLC, massively reducing conflicts and limiting incompatibility was nice, but that's less of a promise and more of a \"we promise the shit we sell isn't broken.\" Well, they are Bethesda.   \n4. The mods would be reviewed at make sure they met a certain standard.\n\nNow that it launched, though, even just as a beta, we see that not even non-games are exempt for E3xaggeration. \n\n1. This might still be the case. Only time will tell.  \n\n2. This is *very clearly* not the case. Nearly every single mod that the Paid Mods Club launched with, are mods that already exist nearly identically on nexus. Many even before the E3 preview. (Horse Power Armor, Modern Furniture and Morgan's Space Suit looks to be largely original new).   \n\n3. This might be irrelevant altogether. There are dozens, if not hundreds of weapon or paintjob mods already totally standalone and conflict free on nexus. Looking at the kinds of mods on the Paid Mods Club, conflict isn't a concern. If something like Gunsmith Extended or Sim Settlements could be integrated at a DLC-level, that would be worth paying for to avoid conflict hell-week on a fresh install, but with the price point they have set, those kinds of mods would cost hundreds of dollars. Bethesda priced this point out of relevance.  \n\n4. When they launch with a small selection and three of them are paintjobs for the Pip-boy, it is clear that the \"Creation\" part of the name has nothing to do with creativity. If the only review of a mod is whether it works and not whether it meets a certain quality- or creative standard, there is no reason to think that the Paid Mods Club wont be flooded with reiterative shit and knock-offs of knock-offs of knock-offs.  \n\nWay to screw it up, Beth.  \n\n**TL;DR** - If we take it for granted that paid mods is an inevitability, which I do, the E3 announced Creation Club features that would minimize damage to free mods and might even help it in certain areas were great. The beta launch demonstrated none of those features are there and this will likely just be a massive cash-out shit-show.

Like... a developer who creates a game and then allows people to sell things to other players in the game and make money off it is, conceptually, really neat. We see this in Warframe with tennogen (a big update hit today so I'm thinkin about it a lot) and Dota 2/TF2 with community stuff.\n\nI grew up with the Microsoft Flight Simulator community, and there were a TON of paid mods, going back a long time. One of the reasons MSFS was so successful was because people were selling airplanes that they'd made that were of obscenely high quality, and you could buy those (some of these mod packs were even available IN STORES! I bought an airliner pack for FS2000 once from a Sam's Club). So I've always been kinda used to it, and I think having that cottage industry form around MSFS is part of what gave FS so much of its power. Closing the game off and preventing people from adding to it really hurt MS Flight.\n\nOf course, Valve seriously changed the rates people could actually get paid from doing it. A guy I knew who used to make a living on TF2 hats can't get anything at all anymore because of that. The same thing is apparently now happening to Dota 2, and that's not great, obviously.\n\nLike, as a developer, that's appealing to me, to be able to let people make money off of creating cool stuff.\n\nBut as someone who grew up modding and stuff, and who believes that modding is crucial to the development of PC gaming as a platform and kids who use modding as a way to get into real game development, I worry that shifting to paid mods \n\nAt the same time, the modding scene's not in a great way. As game production quality has increased, it's got a lot harder to make mods for games, especially singleplayer stuff like Poke646 (anyone remember that?). There's a degree of casualization in how things are made (e.g. Snapmap) if they're made at all (remember the old \"Battlefield 3 mapping tools are too complex for modders\" remark?). A lot of this is down to middleware use (can't distribute that, so it's not helpful) or stuff like how loot is distributed (obviously in a game about grinding for loot, you don't want someone to make a server where players can get all the loot they want immediately), plus the shift towards games-as-a-service (which is just a thing most devs need to do if they want to keep the lights on, since team sizes have to be big to allow for the graphics that customers demand).\n\nModding is in a weird place right now.

If this was a masterwork in journalism- it wouldn't make any more money for the site. \n\nThey are scraping by because: \n\n1. There isn't as big of an audience like there was before. \n2. Most fans would rather watch an influencer on YT (Pewdiepie, Angry Joe) for game content - and mind you, those guys make oodles more cash. \n3. The remaining game audience who wants reviews is so fractured across sites because they are so prone to getting into a frothing rage about a bad review. \n4. Gamergate's one lasting legacy is to destroy any last faith in the medium and the appeal of the job. If it's not doxxing of writers for being an SJW, they get hate from people who are obsessed with the game and will flame them whereever there is an outlet. \n5. Turnover is so rampant at the sites because the people who write there are by and large 22-29 y/o freelancers just trying to get another gig, meaning the content will never reach the old levels of consistency. \n\n\nGames are so much harder to review that what was once a 15-hour task (capable of being finished in work hours) is now a 100+ endeavor. This is not how it works, but if you are to pay a reviewer $15 an hour to for their work on a piece, the raw cost of reviewing RDR2 as a complete state would be a $1500 cost before they even type a single word. The question arises on both sides - would you pay someone to do this without being guaranteed making the money back via ad revenue? If you were a writer, would you do one review for $200 that takes you 120 hours, or would you do 6 reviews at 20 hours a piece?  \n\nThe whole journalism side of games is hopelessly broken. There was a thread among games industry twitter yesterday which talked about how hard it is to create best practices across games because even what worked in 2016 isn't going to work today (partly due to the turnover at so many press outlets). It's a shame because I grew up loving EGM and IGN and PC Gamer but the idea of the majority of people spending 30 minutes reading an article instead of watching a YT video at 1.5 speed is ludicrous.

Miucin is out there ripping off reviews wholesale and now this clown Hatfield (who I remember as being a longtime IGNer, big surprise) isn't even fully putting the game through its paces before giving it a review that will massively affect the game's sales. It's irresponsible and it reeks of half-effort. Do your fucking job!\n\nMeanwhile you have YouTubers like Joseph Anderson who are playing games 4-5 times, putting hundreds of hours in, before writing their reviews. I understand that Daemon Hatfield is not putting together a 3-hour long video on the game like Joseph Anderson will, but if you're reviewing it, you better damn well play the game more than just a few times to make sure you're examining all it has to offer. Your job affects the lives and employment of hundreds of people on the dev team, at the publishers, on the marketing team, etc. You owe it to them to give this your best effort, and if you can't be bothered to do that, then you need to find another fucking job and not take for granted what you do.\n\nBetween this and the Miucin thing I think it's clear IGN needs some top-down changes in the way they do reviews and the people they're hiring to do them. There is plenty of room for improvement in the quality of their 7-15 minute length video reviews and the written reviews that appear on their site. YouTubers like ACG deserve to be eating IGN's lunch for garbage like this.\n\n**TL;DR** IGN reviews are shit, watch YouTubers instead."}, {"comment_id": "eeti47d", "post_id": "aizw0k", "comment": "goddamn ign sucks at everything"}, {"comment_id": "eeu2i3h", "post_id": "aizw0k", "comment": "IGN reviewers only playing maybe 10 mins of a game before writing a review, or not playing it at all? color me shocked"}, {"comment_id": "eerrf6u", "post_id": "aizw0k", "comment": "u/DanStapleton has been very open about their recent issues with reviews, but I wonder how long things like this can continue before there are major shake-ups?

Most professional game reviewers don't fully play games, and it's a real problem.   I mean is .2 points going to matter, and Resident Evil 2 is big enough no one is going to get hurt from this.  Shouldn't game reviewers at least attempt the whole game, or admit why they stopped playing?  It seems important. \n\nWhen I do a review ([shameless plug](https://kinglink-reviews.com/) as well as [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/c/KinglinkReviews)) I think it's important that I give my \"best effort\" to play through a full game.  I mean how do you judge something you haven't seen. \n\nWhen I recently reviewed Rapture Rejects, I stopped playing for a couple clear reasons (player count mostly, but microtransactions).  I didn't get the bonus ending of Shadow of War (though watched it).   I also included hours played and achievement earned so people can see how much time I put into games. \n\nThese are rather minor things to do for a review, but most reviewers seem to hide or avoid talking about how much of a game they played, and it's important information. \n\nThree questions come to mind.  \"When did you stop playing?\"  \"What caused you to stop playing?\"  \"Do you HONESTLY expect to go back?\"  Those should be answered on all games that are ended prematurely. \n\nBut I think reviewers (or their publications) are worried that we'll start to realize that they don't have enough time to play the games they're reviewing or aren't playing enough of them, and ... well that's a problem too. \n\nHonestly, the fact this happened here, makes me wonder how many times have they got away with it?

Honestly everyone is bitching about how it's an ark mod. How it's laggy. Man fuck all that. That's the dumbest shit to complain about. Never been an mmo that didn't start out like ass. It eventually gets fixed and true to their word they worked through Christmas to get the game into a playable state. Everyone complaining about that including op need to get a little perspective. I've been playing mmos since the birth of the genre and it's always like this.\n\nThat's not what's the problem here. So many aspects of the game were just poorly thought out. The diet system sounds good on paper. You need to manage a set of 4 vitamins you get from different sources. Meat, plants, fish, etc. But you're almost always going to be hurting for one and the big issue now is finding fish. Good luck tracking down a fish before your character develops Parkinsons and starts shaking. Once thst happens it's pretty much impossible to function.\n\nThey made many islands that are missing one or more resources. You need trees, plants, animals, and rocks for the most part to get started. Outside of the noob spawns good luck finding an island with all 4. You'll have islands with no trees. Or islands with barely any animals except for level 400 alpha lions that obliterate you in 3 hits. I spun my wheels for 2 days just trying to get a foothold.\n\nThen there's the spawn issues. They just didn't account for the influx of players. And again that's always an issue with mmos. But this is unique. The noob spawns you need to get started only allow 150 players. Yep. They are constantly full. So they added lawless areas that are supposed to help with that. It's still barely enough and as stated those lawless areas lack resources and you can't put down a bed to spawn at. If you die you respawn at a random island.\n\nFinally when you do get underway with your raft that has the worst control scheme imaginable you will find the map is already claimed. You need to find an island to claim so you can put a bed down and have a place to store your raft so it won't degrade. Nope. Good luck battling the larger groups for any spot. There's just no room.\n\nI think in time they may fix this game. But it is an exercise in total frustration now. Hold off on purchasing for the time being.

Kinguin, G2A, and other shady resellers have this in place. You go to Amazon.Com, Humble Bundle, Directly from the Game Devs (Blizzard, ect), they do not offer a paid service just in case your key does not work.\n\nYou might be wondering why that is? Simple. They are authorized resellers (or in the case of the devs themselves, well, its their game). They have legitimate keys, because they come straight from the developer. \n\nSteam and GoG are great sites as well. These marketplaces host games up, and the developers work directly hand in hand with Steam and GoG, and the game is added to your library instantly. Key is valid, ect.\n\nBut with G2A, Kinguin, and other shady sites, you pay just in case your key does not work, so we can get you another key that might not work, because its invalid, or downright illegal.\n\nG2A and Kinguin will more often than not flag any credit card company, because they are based out of China. Steam, Amazon, GoG, Humble Bundle? Never been flagged at any of these sites, because they are reputable, period.\n\nIf you CC company flags a purchase, its a good idea to rethink the transaction entirely.

The only game they made where they actually finished everything and put out a polished product that was cohesive was Halo 3. Everything else they make is plagued with production hell, and all of the talented original dudes who made Halo 1-3 like Jason Jones, Marty O'Donnell, Alex Seropian, Joseph Staten, Hardy Lebel, Max Hoberman etc are all gone. So I don't expect Bungie to ever reach the heights they did with Halo ever again. \n\nHalo 1 and 2 were great in spite of the tight crunch they had, it's unbelievable that those games turned out as well as they did given their production. Halo 1 had one of the greatest multiplayers of all time mostly due to one guy who by some miracle just got it perfect on the first pass with minimal player testing. But again these uber talented people are gone and the people left lack vision and understanding of what makes classic arena multiplayer work.

Examples would be India and the Philippines (where I\u2019m from).\n\nI\u2019m not sure how much the salary is for a call center agent in Ireland, but just for the sake of comparison, the minimum wage for these countries:\n\n- Ireland = \u20ac9.55/hour\n- Philippines = 67 pesos or \u20ac1.11/hour\n\nJobs in the US or Europe generally pay more compared to ones in third world/developing countries. Most call center jobs here pay out \u20ac300 to \u20ac500/month which means they\u2019re saving up on costs.\n\nNow, assuming they are going to outsource call center jobs, then it\u2019s a win-win for everyone:\n\n- former employees received a hefty payout (at least a year\u2019s worth of salary) just to leave\n- the company saves on costs\n- new jobs will be made available for other countries\n\nI doubt this would heavily affect customer experience for a long-term period since call centers tend to \u201cramp up\u201d prior to a new \u201caccount\u201d being opened.

Of course, that man was TotalBiscuit. \n\nThere have been times when I wasn't keen on his actions, back in the day he would be too quick to anger and argue with people over petty things on twitter/youtube comments and whatnot and would say some regrettable things, but man have I gained even more respect for him over these last few years. He's matured so much. All of that shit is in the past, and there is no one in gaming with more integrity - he never takes the easy route. It would've been so easy for him professionally and socially to, for instance, denounce Gamergate like everyone else, but he virtually alone amongst well known names decided to really see what it was about. That's the kind of man he is.\n\nThis news has hit me pretty hard. I really, really hope he pulls through. Well wishes to him and his family.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "cw0s838", "post_id": "3ovfxg", "comment": "God Fucking Dammit."}, {"comment_id": "cw0ru1v", "post_id": "3ovfxg", "comment": "Aw shit, I happened to be listening to [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdN4BTH1qa4) right as I see this... :(\n\nI wish him the absolute best.

Instead of looking at that, let's look at the numbers that companies really care about: financials.\n\n**Development Cost**\n\nDeveloping a mobile game costs **significantly** less than developing a game for PC or console, especially if we're comparing mobile games to AAA games.  According to [this article from 5 years ago:](https://kotaku.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-make-a-big-video-game-1501413649)\n\n>There is no question, however, that the cost to make a AAA games in going up across the board. Last summer, when *Kotaku* editor-in-chief Stephen Totilo talked to Sony's head of worldwide development, Shuhei Yoshida, about game budgets, Yoshida said budgets for top-tier PS4 games would be \"slightly larger\" than the $20 to $50 million price range he estimated as the development cost for \"top PS3 games.\" Four years ago, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot estimated that the average production budget for the generation of games following Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 would be $60 million. In a 2012 investor report, Take-Two admitted some of its \"top titles\" cost in excess of $60 million for development alone.\n\nThese numbers are old, so you can be sure that the cost of developing a game like Alien: Isolation is even higher now.  And these estimates don't even take marketing into account.\n\n**Profit**\n\n[Sega was reportedly disappointed with Alien: Isolation's sales](https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/11/sega-laments-weak-sales-as-alien-isolation-shifts-21-million) of 2.11 million units within its first 6 months.  For simplicity's sake, let's say that every single one of those sales was at $40, which I believe was the game's price at launch.\n\n2.11 million units x $40 = $84.4 million in sales.\n\nSega didn't get all of that money.  Retailers like Gamestop and Best Buy got their cut, as did online stores like Steam, which typically takes 30% of every game sale.  Console manufacturers take a cut, too.  So at the end of the day, Sega received significantly less than $84.4 million from the first 6 months of Alien: Isolation sales.\n\nWhatever that amount was, it got reduced by development cost, marketing cost, cost of good sold, etc. in order to determine what Sega's profit was.  I wouldn't be surprised if they hadn't broken even within those first 6 months of sales.\n\n**Mobile Game Budgets and Profits**\n\nTo get an idea of how relatively cheap mobile games are to make, let's look at one of mobile's biggest money-makers: Clash of Clans.\n\nAccording to [this article:](https://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/AndreiKlubnikin/20170714/301691/How_to_Make_Game_Like_Clash_of_Clans__How_Much_Will_It_Cost_You.php)\n\n>How much does it cost to create a game like Clash of Clans: summing it up  \n>  \n>Marketing and maintenance costs aside, we\u2019ve arrived at a figure close to $400 thousand \u2013 and that\u2019s the very minimum budget for a long-lasting hit like Clash of Clans.\n\nHere's a general estimate:\n\n>*Provided you address a reliable offshore iOS/Android app development company* *and come up with a flexible business model that presupposes gradual gameplay and feature set evolution, you may start with a $ 200 thousand budget and continue the dev process after the game release.*\n\n$200,000 - $400,000 is, obviously, a hell of a lot cheaper than the $20 million to $60 million needed to get into AAA development.  As for revenues and profit:\n\n>Released by Supercell in 2012, the Clash of Clans franchise has generated over $ 5 billion in revenue\n\n$5 billion in revenue off of a development budget that's much less than $1 million.  That's insane, right?  If anything, it's a hell of a lot more appealing than spending $20-60 million to develop a game like Alien: Isolation, only to be disappointed with its sales.\n\nThere's a reason why game companies go the mobile route, and it has nothing to do with Youtube likes.\n\n**Edit:**  By the way, please bear in mind that I'm not saying this Aliens mobile game is going to make anywhere close to as much money as Clash of Clans did.  I used Clash of Clans as an example because it's probably among the most expensive of mobile games, but still has a dev budget of only <$500,000.  \n\nWhat I'm saying is that there's a much, much higher chance of Sega turning an attractive profit with an Alien mobile game than with a PC / console sequel to Alien: Isolation.  Their combined development and marketing spend is probably a lot less than $1 million, and making a few million dollars from this game is well within the realm of possibility.

Not to mention, the longer I stayed in the Discord and read the chat, the more I realized Ben and Rebecca are absolutely UNABLE to take criticism at all whatsoever. They've curated their little Ooblets community so closely that there's no \"negative\" commentary allowed, and they live in their safe little bubble of an echo chamber. Their \"Star Belly\" members foam at the mouth to protect the two, and scream about \"stupid baby gamers\" unprovoked. One of the funniest things that happened while I was observing was the banning of someone using an available Pepe react emote, a Star Belly member complaining about it (\"can we ban this guy using Pepe, it's racist\"), and then they took away any ability to react unless you had that title in the Discord.

And we're ALLOWED to share it. \n\nThese people think they can double down. This isn't even about Epic anymore, its about devs who are too young or stupid to understand business. Piss of the audience, and you are all of a sudden in empty auditorium. \n\nAnd to top it all off, these devs try and act like Steam is some bad guy. As if they're the ones trying to hurt competition. Valve does *a lot* for PC gaming as a hobby. A LOT. I would have probably bought ooblets if I saw it released on Steam. I have long and loving history for games like Rune Factory. Sadly, I discovered the game through their blog post and I decided that no matter what kind of game they  made, I simply will not buy from them. Even if they released their games for free on Steam tomorrow. I have standards, and its perfectly reasonable for consumers to have standards. \n\nThey try and make up an excuse for themselves and call gamers entitled. Guess what, ass licks.. consumers ARE entitled. Its OUR money.. at least.. its supposed to be. But now, Epic will just buy the first 100,000 worth of sales and create an exclusivity deal. (yes, i pulled my numbers out of my ass because I DONT KNOW how much bribe money goes around) Not just that, but almost ALWAYS after the game spent a large amount of time gaining attention and hype ON STEAM. This alone is reason enough to piss people off, even if they DO like EGS. It's a constant stream of broken promises when Epic gets involved, and these devs can't see the forest for the trees. \n\nSo I'll end this with Fuck Epic. Fuck Tim. And devs who think that giving the middle finger to the consumers is a good business model, fuck you."}, {"comment_id": "evsw1f4", "post_id": "cl3yoc", "comment": "Wow. For sure not buying this game.

He gives a first hand account of how Chinese money is corrupting American games and media.*\n\n\"This hurts. But until Blizzard reverses their decision on @blitzchungHS I am giving up playing Classic WoW, which I helped make and helped convince Blizzard to relaunch. There will be no Mark of Kern guild after all.\n\nLet me explain why I am #BoycottBlizzard.\n\nI am ethnically Chinese. I was born in Taiwan and I lived in Hong Kong for a time. I have done buisiness with China for many years, with serveral gaming companies there.\n\nSo I think I have a valid perspective here, having been a Team Lead at Blizzard and having grown up in Asia.\nI have watched China slowly take over as the dominant investing force in gaming and movies over the years. It\u2019s a shame US companies never believed as strongly as China and Asia in investing in games, but this allowed China to have unprecedented influence over our media.\n\nChinese game companies have grown huge not just because of market size, but because the government subsidizes them. They get free land, free offices, and huge infusions of cash.\n\nThis cash was and is used to do expand and buy up stakes in US gaming companies.\nI\u2019ve seen firsthand the corruption of Chinese gaming companies, and I was removed from a company I founded (after Blizzard) for refusing to take a 2 million dollar kickback bribe to take an investment from China. This is the first time I\u2019ve ever spoken pubically about it.\n\nI\u2019ve also seen how American company reps in China have been offered similar bribes to get licenses for large AAA titles. Not everyone refused like I did.\n\nChinese companies tried to ruin my career with planted press stories. Money is often paid for favorable press in China and some of that money flows here to the US as well.\n\nUnfortunately, money talks. China has succeeded in infiltrating all levels of tech, gaming and more.\nUnfortunately, US and European companies are loath to take risks and invest in game companies legally as much as China was. China remained one of the few places mid tier studios could get funding.\n\nSo again, China influence grew. I\u2019m sure this is the same for movies as well.\nBut now we are in a situation where unlimited Communist money dictates our American values. We censor our games for China, we censor our movies for China.\n\nNow, game companies are silencing voices for freedom and democracy.\n\nChina is dictating that the world be authoritarian.\nOf all the companies in the world, Blizzard is the LAST company I ever expected to give in to China\u2019s demands.\n\nBlizzard was always about \u201cgamer first\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t be greedy.\u201d\n\nAt least, it was when I was there.\n\nIt\u2019s one thing to keep politics out of games, which I am still a proponent of doing. It\u2019s another to unfairly and harshly punish voices that speak out against corruption, against abuses of human rights, and freedom.\n\nI take a huge risk by saying this. China monitors all social media and I know this means that we will probably never get an investment from China for my new MMO, and probably never get a license to operate there.\n\nBut enough is enough. I stand with Hong Kong, and I oppose Blizzard\u2019s obvious and laughably transparent fear of China.\n\nIt\u2019s time for Blizzard to grow the spine it used to have, and to do what\u2019s right for gamers once again.\n\nGamers, rise up.\n\nAnd yes, this means I will be refusing any deal for Epic exclusivity. The money comes from Tencent. Em8ER will never be an Epic game store exclusive.\n\nThis might mean we never make a dime, but more is at stake now than just games. A line has to be drawn, and I\u2019m drawing it now.\""}, {"comment_id": "f36zdbm", "post_id": "dfyzkx", "comment": "The most important thing to remember here is - these companies don't want just China's money - they want Western countries AND China's money.\n\nSo if they don't play ball China turns off the tap - if they do play ball the western consumers still buy the games/products enough they get both.\n\nI can assure you if doing deals with China cost them their market in the West they would drop appeasing China in heartbeat because the amount of effort expended to satisfy China for the income they make solely from there isn't worth it.\n\nYour best bet in cases like this is to literally do the one thing we're all shouting for people to do - vote with your wallet - we're charging headfirst into a recession on a global scale here people - not spending money is something you should get used to early."}, {"comment_id": "f37lnc0", "post_id": "dfyzkx", "comment": "China has its tentacles in anything it deems worthwhile and has been buying up land, securing resource companies, buying tech companies out by throwing money at them they can't refuse.

When of comes down it, all politics is, in its most abstract sense, is a body of ideologies, or in a simplified term, a body of ideas and opinions.\n\nYou can not keep ideas and opinions separate from ideas and opinions. They are the same thing. Politics affects everything from what we to, to what we think, to what we say.\n\nEventually, ignoring something and hoping it goes away backfires and you're eventually propelled in to the very scenario you'd hoped to avoid.\n\nI understand that we want video games to be these inhibited and raw formed ideas into actual playable worlds (this is what makes video games so magical and amazing), but you can't just ignore peoples opinions. Looking at human history, doing nothing usually hurts your cause and your goals in the long run and allows someone else to step in and enforce their own ideas and opinions to the point where they enforce their own will.\n\nThis is the result of that. You have to be involved and you have to be the change you wish to see.

Some research says that it is 6-7 times more expensive to acquire a new customer than it is to keep a current one. Banks or mobile providers know it best, so they don\u2019t have any problem with going an extra mile for a customer who is not quite satisfied and often offer him something special. Not only it is more expensive but also much more difficult to keep existing and loyal clients (let alone keeping them fully satisfied and happy!) than to gain some new ones. Take this rule into account while organizing your customer service processes and do your best to look after them.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* They can stop being your clients in a heartbeat\n\nIs not rocket science, nowadays clients easily switch their love brands. It is often caused by terrible customer service. Clients waiting for ages to get feedback or comment from a brand? Unacceptable! But it still happens. And gaining clients\u2019 trust takes up to 12 positive experiences to make up for one unresolved negative experience.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou can\u2019t gain customers\u2019 satisfaction for ever, you need to look after them all the time. Try to talk with them, instead of to them. Ask questions, offer constant support, send personalized messages or offers, use targeted website surveys, email surveys or any other technique that will help you communicate with your customers. Take care of each and every of your clients\u2019 need and you\u2019ll be rewarded with their gratitude and loyalty. Sounds like a good deal, doesn\u2019t it? Brands often take their audience for granted, and they\u2019ve never been so wrong \u2013 one decision, or lack of it, can result in losing a lot of clients and their respect. That\u2019s why measuring clients\u2019 satisfaction is so important.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* It\u2019s (all) about the money, too\n\nIt shouldn\u2019t be surprising, but the customer satisfaction is also reflected in your revenue. Customers\u2019 opinion and feelings about the brand can affect, in both positive and negative way, the essential metrics \u2013 such as the number mentions and repeated transactions, and also customer lifetime value or customer churn. Happy customers won\u2019t look at your competitors offers \u2013 they will happily interact with your brand again, make a purchase and recommend the product further. If you meet all of their requirements and answer their needs while delivering the best quality of your services, they will be fully satisfied. Not to mention your brand will increase sales revenue!\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMeasuring customer satisfaction should become your daily habit \u2013 not something you do from time to time and only if you\u2019re about to face a crisis management. If you don\u2019t know how to do it right, you can take a look at our guide to measuring customer satisfaction to make things easier.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Customer satisfaction is a factor that helps you stand out of the competition\n\nKate Zabriskie once said that *\u201cAlthough your customers won\u2019t love you if you give bad service, your competitors will.\u201d* and we couldn\u2019t agree more. Your competitive rivals are just waiting for you to make a wrong move. What is more, they can often play a role of an\u00a0instigator. Being prepared for their provocations is not enough if you don\u2019t know how to deal with the negative backlash. However, if you provide your customers with an amazing customer service, you will gain arguments to convince those uncertain of your services.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n* Great customer experience can take your brand places\n\nThe importance of customer satisfaction should never be neglected. You should consider it especially while planning your marketing and positioning campaigns. Satisfied customers are more likely to share your content across the social media. They will also more keenly interact with your posts, leaving some delightful and admirable comments. Later you can use it as the source for case studies and success stories. Being an example of a company that provides a ravishing customer satisfaction? Every brand should aim for it.\n\n\\-------------------------\n\n[https://survicate.com/customer-satisfaction/importance-customer-satisfaction/](https://survicate.com/customer-satisfaction/importance-customer-satisfaction/)\n\n\\-------------------------\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBasically, a Company needs customers more than customers need a Company. They can call us all the names in the book, we can be nerds, crybabies, neck-beards and even man-babies, the fact still remains we are the ones with the money. They are meant to entice us to buy from them, not the other way around.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI said this in another post, I really hate the shill culture where we have customers who defend a companies rights ahead of their own rights as a customer. We are the ones who pay them our money, then have them lash out at us and call us names just for demanding quality before we actually buy their product and give them OUR MONEY!

That's it, that's how it. We are emotional and selfish sometimes. So even devs and players are sometimes stupid (and I'm both as I mentioned). Sometimes we are mean, sometimes we feel entitled... Sometimes both of us are assholes and/or hysteric.   \n\n\n**What happened with Metro was really unfortunate and unfair**, I agree in that. I completely understand your feelings towards Epic about that. But releasing an indie game as an exclusive on the Epic store is a possibility which some just can't refuse. **The game dev business (for indies) is \\_extremely\\_ risky.** Most of the time we basically sacrifise our own wealth to be able creating games. **Please, show us some understanding** in that. If you don't like something, just vote with your wallet. We will also understand. **It is not like we wanna hurt you in any way or we love complicating things.**  \n\n\nI'd like to mention that the OP made this title out of from the fact that **the mentioned guy liked a tweet. That's all.** it doesn't necessary mean that he completely or partially agrees with it. **A like is not equal of saying \"I agree\".** Read other comments below to find details.  \n\n\nSidenote: I'm not in the lucky position that Epic would be interested in my game as an exclusive. If I had the chance I'd go for it with a still unlreleased game BUT not with an already released or preordered game. It is because Steam is just not a good bet anymore for us. **Steam simply doesn't care about us anymore.** **There is no curation, if we write a ticket to them, they often don't respond, they halved indie visibility (what was already near to zero) since October (by silently changing the recommendation algorithms) to get more traffic for AAA games what they just covered up with partially false announcements etc.** Look for articles about the topic written by Jake Brickett, or just look for videos on youtube about the topic, there are a few if you are interested. A few made it big on Steam a couple of years ago, but things are changing. Maybe you can hit it big once in 20 years, and then you have to survive from that money in the next 20 years (if you wanna continue creating games). Around 95% of indie games doesn't generate income, from the remaining 5% only 30% can make it even.  \n\n\nWell AAA... that's another dimension.

What you are doing when you buy from shady places in which could be selling fake or stolen goods, you are gambling.\n\nNow its not that gambling is just \"bad\" that you should avoid it like the plague in 100% of any scenario. (It can be bad, ofcourse, and often is). But there are times where gambling can pay off. You just have to learn what is a good and bad bet. Gambling in the traditional sense (casinos, lotteries, etc), are almost always a bad bet. But taking on business ventures if the conditions are right can be very good.\n\nBut what you need to do is think more like a business or entrepreneur. You need to calculate the risk vs the reward of your actions or purchases.\n\nIn your case, you're buying a 60 euro (im guessing?) Game for 40 euros. So you're gambling 40 euro to gain 20 euros. Off the bat, thats not a great risk:reward ratio. You should look to atleast double your money at the very minimum. Now this is just factoring a 50/50 odds. I dont think you have a fair 50/50 chance of receiving a legit key from these sellers. This makes your risk:reward much worse, as it increases the risk of loss. Now to also add to the worsening of this deal, you can find the game for less than 60 euro on legit game key sellers (Use isthereanydeal.com which lists sites like humble and others. Green man gaming is not listed but generally OK even though they have done a few questionable things in past). So its very likely you could have bought this key from a legit seller for 40-50 euros.\n\nWhat this means is you gambled 40 euro on a less than 50/50 chance to gain anywhere from 0-10 euros. That's a horrible decision. However, you can look at it that you were lucky or right to lose that money. Because you took such a risk with very little possible reward, its good you were not rewarded for your horrible choice (as to not reenforce that behavior). Now you likely (hopefully) came away with a better understanding on how to properly calculate risk vs reward a bit better and may be more reluctant to invest in such shady deals. Be lucky you didnt gamble your car or house or life savings on such things (and hopefully now, because of this experience, will be less likely to do that now).\n\nAs others have said if you used credit card or paypal to pay, you can use the \"dispute charge\" option and explain the situation to get your money back. If you purchased with a debit card you may not be so lucky. (Also a lesson to always use credit or paypal for online purchases). You can still try to contact your bank and discuss your options."}, {"comment_id": "e9tk662", "post_id": "9xlnjh", "comment": "never buy from these types of sites, g2a, kinguin, all of them"}, {"comment_id": "e9urnzv", "post_id": "9xlnjh", "comment": "call your bank and provide the evidence and dispute the charge. it\u2019s called a merchant dispute.

You\u2019ve met the criteria to file a dispute when they fail to deliver the goods purchased, didn\u2019t deliver what was promised.

Most online retailers don't even require supporting information (zip code, country, etc.) to be accurate, so long as the bank sends a response code of \"authorized\", the merchant will honor it. This occurs with cards marked as stolen by merchant services, the money is usually authorized unless the bank/merchant is given specific instructions. (I don't even want to tell you how shady online retailer-ship is and how hamstrung small companies are to really affect change and integrity)\n\nSecondly, the stolen money is immediately written off by risk management/insurance firms. That's why they're so quick to have you file a card as \"stolen\", the money moved around but only two people profited (the thief as he now has an item that can be resold and the merchant who accepted the sale). Lastly, banks and card services refuse to actively investigate card fraud unless the suspect is known by the victim and direct charges can be brought forward. This is legally messy, as \"data\" is not considered an \"asset\" that can be \"stolen\" according to current tort theory.\n\nSo, after those three problems coalesce, even if G2A vetted every single key and card, they would still be a platform for thieves because the whole system is designed to benefit identity thieves. G2A could absolutely be doing a better job, but they aren't doing anything that bigger institutions aren't also doing, they just get the shit end of the stick because dev companies don't want to deactivate keys when it could lead to someone who purchased it \"legitimately\" is now left without a game or a refund.

I bought a TV from Samsung that was damaged on arrival. I couldn't get anyone from their support to help me with a return, despite their support admitting that it needed to be returned. I called my credit card company to see what I could do. The process went like this:\n\n\\- You must attempt to work with the company for 30 days. If you are not successful in reaching a satisfying conclusion, the credit card company will step in.\n\n\\- You must provide evidence that the item you received was unsatisfactory and you made the effort to resolve the situation yourself.\n\n\\- They will give you a conditional refund so that you aren't on the hook for paying for the item until the issue is resolved.\n\n\\- If they determine that you are entitled to a replacement item or compensation, and you exhausted your own resources to fix it yourself, the credit card company will work with the selling company on your behalf to try and solve the situation with their clout. In my case, Citi was able to get Samsung to accept the return and help me ship the TV back.\n\nIf all else fails and you are definitely in the right, the credit card company will refund you as part of the protection provided with their credit card service. They may penalize the seller or threaten to stop doing business with them. This is where the seller retaliates and cancels your account or refuses to business with you in the future. Also, your credit card company hates doing this, so don't make it a habit. They can cancel your service as well if they feel you are trying to abuse the system or if you are simply costing them too much.\n\nIn short, you can definitely get a hold of your credit card company to explore your options.

I dont think like something like Ark should still be \"early access\" after being out for years. I can see the point of \"it takes years to make a game\", however it's just bug fixing and adding new content that many early access games are doing, and what is the same thing released games do. Like if you look at kerbal space program, it left early access but has still added a bunch of new content after launch. At some point, early access games need to launch, become released, and they can still push new updates. However if they are able to stay hiding in early access, they will.\n"}, {"comment_id": "derempb", "post_id": "5ymmnw", "comment": "I agree that things need to be done in order to prevent devs abusing the early access title. Rather than putting a time based regulation on it, I think having early access games be held to certain extra rules would help insentivise proper usage.\n\nFirst, I think that early access games should be barred from having any extra paid content in their games. Whether this is proper DLC or other internal transactions, if a game isn't finished all progress made rightfully belongs to the people already purchased the game. Perhaps a less restrictive version would be that all players who currently own the game must get the DLC for free if it's released while the game is still in early access. \n\nSecondly, I think that all early access games should allow a \"demo\" where you download the full game and are allowed to try it for some time period, maybe around an hour. This should be enough to show players the true state of the game and allow them to better make a decision if it's worth the price in its current state. After the hour, you would have to pay to own the game if you want to keep playing. The return system is **not** enough as there's a soft limit to how much you can use it. Alternatively, the return policy for early access games could be relaxed.\n\nFinally, I think all developers should be required to make a monthly report on their game. This report would go over a few different things and in my opinion should be goal based. Every month they would release development goals for the month and tentative goals for the two months after that for a total of three months of forecast goals. In the report, they would also need to go over the goals for the most recent month and which of the goals they accomplished. If they fail goals, they will need to specifically mention which they failed for the month and whether they plan to change the upcoming month's projected goals. \n\nPlayers who own the game could report a dev if they aren't properly making their monthly report or are being vague dicks. \n\nThis will be a lot of extra work for the dev, but I think they need to be held to a specific standard as an early access game. If they don't meet that standard, their game should be either removed from sale or have a price cap for the maximum amount they're allowed to charge for it imposed. They would be able to choose which if both are available. Those who don't meet the standards would have a big red warning and a confirmation button when purchasing or something. \n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "deret16", "post_id": "5ymmnw", "comment": "Two of my favorite games of all time - Rimworld and Factorio - have been in early access for more than three years each. They are both still in development with regular content updates and strong support from the developers. Neither has changed their price over the years, nor offered any DLC. I just don't see either of these games being possible with your suggestion.\n\nSure these are rare outstanding games, but the fact is they would never have been as successful as they are if they had been forced out of EA a year after they started sales. Since each of them did delay Steam release until they were well along the development, perhaps they could have worked with that in Steam but even there I am not sure.\n\nFor example, Rimworld was talking about releasing the final product a little over a year ago. However in that time the dev has decided to continue improving, balancing, and making general changes in that time and hasn't made any sort of promises or deadlines on when a final game will be released.\n\nOn a similar note, Factorio A15 has been delayed several times because the developers want to be sure their new features are balanced and ready. A15 was slated for a February release, but at the start of Feb they announced that it would be delayed until the end of March. This announcement was met with near-unanimous praise (!) from the community, because they understand the value of the process.

Additionally, we have the tag to discourage people looking for a more refined experience. But if they were forced to remove it to keep appearing in the Steam Frontpage, or to be able to keep selling their game in Steam, they'd do that in a heartbeat. After all, there's people happy enough with the game to play it for hundreds of hours. And what would we get?

No big media campaign and hype building to get people in on that first round of investment, just deliver what you have and see what people think.  For example, I don't see something like Rust surviving a first round kickstarter pitch, but maybe I'm wrong. Point is, I like being able to sample gameplay ideas that are probably too risky for a developer to go all in on.     \n\nThat said, there are shenanigans. And I think some developers are charging way too much for EA, but then I just skip over those titles.

The guns goes quickly but s/he is quite bad at level design. Now as the user base grows bugs get some priority, they can take everything from a couple of seconds to correct the missing character to weeks for some really obscure and hard to replicate bugs. So after a while the project is mostly stable with some low prio bugs s/he decides that maybe 12 maps while not that far off perhaps isn't enough to keep players happy, s/he is after all still ass at level design, so a map editor to allow for community maps should be added. The players love the map editor but like with everything else it has some bugs that need fixing, which again takes time but eventually the core game is compleat, it only took a year and a half after the first early access release.

Widgets is a new unique game that resembles checkers mixed with solitaire for VR. (I just made that up, if you actually make it, you owe me nothing). I talk about it online, share some videos of gameplay, and it gains interest of a small group. I need funding, so I make an early version available on Steam to sell to that small group and get feedback.\n\n**Widgets - *Experimental* $9.99**\n\nVR takes off, and my game spreads like wildfire. I hire some actual programmers, plan out the features set, and start development. I need more money.\n\n**Widgets - *Developmental* $14.99**\n\nThree long years later, the next generation of VR headsets will be coming out soon, and I decide to jump on that bandwagon with Widgets. I Announce the Beta for Widgets, lock in all features. I split my dev team between polishing the game for current VR consoles and making it work on the new VR consoles.\n\n**Widgets - *Beta* $14.99**\n\nIn a few months time, we are not only ready for release on first generation VR, but we have the second gen stuff fully tested. (This example assumes next gen VR will not be backwards compatible, dont yell at me, this is not a prediction, unless I am right, in which it is a prediction).\n\n**Widgets - *Released* $14.99**\n\n**Widgets for VR 2.0 - *DLC* $29.99**\n\n**Widgets for VR 2.0: Vegas, Baby! - *Released* $4.99**\n\nIn this example, Widgets went through all of the pre-release phases, and then jumped to Released. I (the developer) am no longer supporting Widgets for VR 1.0, because all updates are going to Widgets for VR 2.0, so I mark it as Released. Widgets for VR 2.0 couldn't be tested publicly before release, so it went straight to being listed as DLC. DLC means it has been released, but we are selling content packs. Now Steam or whatever has 3 listings for Widgets: VR 1.0, VR 2.0, and the first content pack, Vegas, baby! Note in the example that the content pack is not going to get updates.\n\n**In conclusion:**\n\nThis standard would be to give the purchaser and idea of what to expect with pre-release games. If you buy an experimental card game, and it turns into chess, suck it up, you bought an experimental game. If you buy a developmental game, expect a long haul before a final release, major content and game play changes. Devs of the developmental game should expect to have to handle possibly angering the fan base. Beta is classic beta: \"Here is a mostly finished game, try to break it and please report it if you do.\"\n\nAfter release, expectations grow. Updating would be rare, as updates are free in this model, and designed to provide continued sales. Minecraft and possibly Overwatch come to mind. Updating could also apply to a game with a strong modding community. DLC is the standard for most modern games. Subscription is for MMO's or anything where the developer is hosting a server and charging for access time. We all know Free to Play means Pay to Win, or you get basics for free and there are upgrades to buy.  The kicker is Released. Released means the end of developer support for the game, but sales are still strong enough to continue to list the game.\n\nTL;DR: We need 3 categories for pre-release games, such as Experimental, Developmental and Beta. This will give both gamers and developers a better idea of what is ahead.\n"}, {"comment_id": "des5nk2", "post_id": "5ymmnw", "comment": "I've never understood why people care so much about the 'Early Access' label.

A person trying to log into an account that is protected by 2FA must succeed both the 2FA and the password. You may have been notified about simply the attempt to bypass the 2FA when the person tried logging into your account.\n\n\n>me: i'm not sure i understand. if i try to login and type the wrong password it doesn't trigger 2fa, it tells me my username/password is incorrect\n\n>Sarah M: So the 2FA code input typically come after the password attempt.\n\n\n>Sarah M: The hijacker is probably getting past the password phase and the 2FA is preventing them from an actual successful login. 2FA will trigger if the login location is not recognized. This could also be why you're not being prompted to put in the 2FA codes if you are logging in consistently from the same location.\n\n\n>me: \"getting past the password phase\" are you saying this is possible to do without actually having my password?\n\n\n>me: because that's almost exactly what i said, they should only be able to trigger 2fa if they type my password correctly\n\n\n>me: if they only need one not the other what is the 2nd factor?\n\n\n>Sarah M: The hijacker may have gotten ahold of the password and we, unfortunately, have no way of knowing how or where they would have accessed that information. It's good that you have 2FA enabled. The most we can do on our end is change your email for you (which would make it harder for the hijackers to locate your account). We could reset the password again for you if you would like.\n\n\n>me: okay above you said it most likely is not malware or spyware, so if that's the case that would point to a huge security flaw on your side"}, {"comment_id": "ekpxq1p", "post_id": "bcbaoj", "comment": "Blizzard 2FA can also be bypassed too, last week my account got logged in but it just ignores the 2FA."}, {"comment_id": "ekpybu8", "post_id": "bcbaoj", "comment": "oh, session issues from something in their login is my guess.  multiple authentications to change from some one login session to another internal systems session and it\u2019s getting messed up."}, {"comment_id": "ekpzepp", "post_id": "bcbaoj", "comment": "I get these emails weekly"}, {"comment_id": "ekpzhm4", "post_id": "bcbaoj", "comment": "Ubisoft only utilizes 2FA on sites that reveal personal information and therefore require higher security such as uPlay.\n\nOn websites with reduced security needs, like [Ubisoft.com](https://Ubisoft.com) and individual game websites you might have logged into, they do not use 2FA.\n\nWhat you are seeing in your login history is likely a compromised password from one of those sites.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe customer service representive reffered to \"marketing sites\" such as assassinscreed.com or thedivisiongame.com  and did not mean 3rd party marketing companies."}, {"comment_id": "ekpzvst", "post_id": "bcbaoj", "comment": "This is a lawsuit waiting to happen.

I have an AMD Radeon Rx 480+, i5 6500 3.20 Ghz, 8 GB of DDR4 Ram, etc... For reference, Assassin's Creed Odyssey, a game much more graphically intensive and detailed than this one, runs at ultra settings at a solid 60 fps with no dips on my PC. I have set every setting to medium, lowered shadows, and  messed with other settings to the extent of my ability (you've not included many graphical settings that most PC games have, but that's besides the point.  I still have structures and NPCs not loading, T-posing enemies, and totally missing textures that are just rainbow grids.\n\n\n\nTo put it bluntly, the game doesn't work. I\"m getting maybe 10-20 FPS average most of the time. if i'm near more than one enemy i immediately sink to 20 fps. 5 different areas of the map turned into actual slide shows, resulting in my dying many times as i just saw distorted pictures of robots attacking. This is unacceptable for a $60 game, and I'd like a refund for this product. When I buy a $60 game from any other AAA developer, like Rockstar, or Nintendo, or Naughty Dog, I know that regardless of the game's quality it'll actually work. I can no longer say the same for Bethesda.\"\n\nEdit: I know in the grand scheme of things this is not a very high end rig. But I have a 1080p monitor, so for all intents and purposes this is the highest end rig I'd need to play any game. Again, AC Odyssey has run beautifully at 60 fps on mostly ultra settings with no dips for 30 hours now. My computer isn't the issue.

My girlfriend is successfully running the game with no frame rate issues on a 1050Ti and i3 something or another, and that\u2019s kinda surprising to me. I think this backlash is an example of a negative effect shared experiences on the internet can have, everyone is only sharing bugs because it\u2019s what people are talking about, and therefore people are taking those bugs as personal experiences, tainting their personal experience with the game. There\u2019s so much misinformation and confusion around Bethesda\u2019s engine and Bethesda\u2019s lack of communication that people have just largely decided to hate the game. It\u2019s also possible people bought the game expecting traditional fallout. I don\u2019t know.

The quests are like ripped out from a run-of-the-mill MMO, the few NPCs you find are traders with 0 personality or interest to them.\n\nIts a grind game. Its nothing, really.

They used data collected by other groups and compiled it. Theres a much higher chance for misrepresentation of data when you keep using other sources instead of conducting it yourself so you know the study was properly done. Writing a thesis based on other studies seems all to common now days, and most all of the time its misrepresented. However, the study provided does not seem paint the picture of a gambling epidemic.\n\nSo digging into the meat of the study, 2.8K children were surveyed between the ages of 11-16. So its not a huge sample size. Of those, the age group which gambled the most were the 15 and 16 year olds. The overwhelming majority agree and understanding gambling is bad and harmful.\n\nOver 85% of the gambling done was gambling at arcades which had slot machines and private bets with friends (like \"I bet you $5 you cant make that jump\" or soemthing). I dont personally consider private bets between friends to be \"gambling\" (it can be at a certain point, like if you're betting on everything that happens), but in general, thats normal for children to do. Its more about the challenge and overcomming it and showing off than it is about the gambling aspect. Private bets made up 40% of all the gambling the children did. The other 47% was gambling in family arcades. So they had gambling machines in a place where children hang out. (Probably not the best place for it?). So its real gambling, not gambling in video games, that seem to get children introduced and possibly addicted to gambling.\n\nOne last point to draw on is, gambling in children has halved over the last decade. While in the last few years, its gone up (dont know where bbc got \"quadrupled\" from, as it didnt even double). In 2011 28% of children were engaged in gambling. It dipped to 12% in 2016 and went back up to 14% in 2018. So while it has increased, in the last decade is has more than halved.\n\nIf any conclusion can be drawn, it would be loot boxes seem to have lowered real life gambling. Now correlation is not causation. So I cant say for sure gambling is lower now because of loot boxes. (Which is not something basically anyone with adgendas will admit. They use correlation as absolute concrete fact). But I believe it would make sense both from a psychological perspective as well as correlating it across other metrics such as violent crime. Which studies have shown violent crime is at an extreme low. I believe its due to video game violence and the internet in general giving people catharsis. I believe it has a similar relationship for video game gambling and real life gambling. By giving people access to gambling in games, it turns them away from real gambling (because they get that same \"rush\" you get from gambling from you own home. Also it shows you how unlikely you are to ever win or get what you want from gambling)\n\nI too wish to see microtransactions removed from games. However trying to force game companies to remove them via legislation **will not, and never has in the history of humanity worked for anything**. Advocating to remove it via legislation shows not only extreme ignorance of the world and history, but also a sense of entitlement. The governments purpose is to protect your rights. You do not have the right to play games with no microtransactions. Thinking its your right to not have to see or deal with that, is absurdly entitled. So the best, and only **real** method for removing these practices is to **stop supporting the businesses who push that stuff**. \n\nStop buying the newest call of duty and assassins creed games. You will literally not die if you stop playing them. (Which seems to be the mentality). I haven't purchased an ea game since BF4 and have never purchased a uplay title. I really haven't even purchased any AAA games in over a year. Believe it or not, you dont need to play call of duty and these other games! Even if others keep buying them, stick to your **principles** (though it seems like the vast majority of gamers, have none), and dont support the shit stains of the game industry. Eventually, the companies who dont fuck gamers over will rise to the top and the giants who push loot boxes and other nonsense will fall. You just need to have principles and stick to them. Even if \"Omg this call of duty really is the best one ever made\". No dont fucking buy it. These companies exploit you because they know you're weak willed. Every time you \"make an exception because this game is really fun\", they laugh all the way to the bank as they whip you like the slaves you are. And if you willing become a slave because \"Omg bro this game is fun tho\", you **deserve** to be forced to buy loot boxes and shit."}, {"comment_id": "ea61rq0", "post_id": "9z2kx0", "comment": "That is a super misleading title, and the article says nothing that corroborates the title's claim."}, {"comment_id": "ea65qvv", "post_id": "9z2kx0", "comment": "\\>  **it turns out that gateway gambling introduces children to gambling**\n\nThe article doesn't say that at all? \n\nJesus fuck this sub has no problem starting a witch-hunt without any stats don't they.\n\nDisclaimer - Fuck gambling, fuck lootboxes, and fuck false claims."}, {"comment_id": "ea5wuxm", "post_id": "9z2kx0", "comment": "Damn, I knew playing dominoes in RDR2 would turn out bad "}, {"comment_id": "ea61hvx", "post_id": "9z2kx0", "comment": "Here's a thought.

If you want to buy something outright from the market and not gamble for it, you can pay a heavy premium, as displayed with one of the [Lightsabers Here](http://swtordata.com/cartel/cartelitems/505). That costs 7600 [Cartel Coins](https://www.swtor.com/buy). The highest pack you can purchase is 5500 for 39.99, and then you'd still have to purchase additional coins at 19.99 for 2400 coins to make up the difference. (It is important to note they put items on sale sometimes for 25% off or so. I think currently 5100 Coins is it's price, making it still, a 40 dollar purchase for that in game saber which \"Is only cosmetic\")\\*\\*\n\nThis is not the only item that is this expensive. They've been doing this for years now on SWTOR, and for whatever reason, people are ok with it. It shows if you do this, even the nastiest way, you can still profit from it and even have defenders if the IP has rabid enough fans.\n\nI'm behind the drive to end these practices, as I watched the loot boxes come into SWTOR and end actual content in the game being of value. You see, part of the plot here is that the in-game stuff you can earn is designed to be god-awful looking. It's textures often aren't as good, or design is boxy and less crafted. It drives you to want to get the \"just cosmetic\" gear to replace it with so you don't look so out of place. They've weaponized cosmetics.\n\n\\*\\*Revisiting that now with the saber. Yes, it is cosmetic- but a cosmetic you can get at level 1. This means that you can give this to yourself over and over again if you unlock it for your account, requiring an additional coin purchase of up to 480 coins or so, and then use this weapon which is customizable to be more powerful than other starting weapons. This is SUPER minor with how fast the low levels progress and it becomes irrelevant, but it needs to be stated for full disclosure.\n\nIn short, because no one plays SWTOR anymore, no one has noticed that EA has been doing this for almost a decade before you all got serious about being angry over it. That's why they're shocked you suddenly give a shit. They've been doing it IN STAR WARS, too.

Secondly, I could easily see P2W regulations hurting many free to play games like Warframe and Planetside2. While both of those games are know for having better monetization, they could face legal issues forcing them to redesign their core gameplay just to fit the law.
