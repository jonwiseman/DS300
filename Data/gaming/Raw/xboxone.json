I guess we should just give away our rights\n\nSomething that never gets talked about in these Net Neutrality astroturf threads (look at the upvote to comment ratios) is that Title II Net Neutrality applies censorship laws to the internet. Notice how the pro-Net Neutrality posters always talk about the possibility that Comcast or Verizon will \"censor\" certain content. What they fail to mention is that the [Law that the FCC reinterpreted and applied to ISPs in 2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_neutrality_in_the_United_States#Timeline_of_significant_events) and called \"Net Neutrality\" actually contains obscenity laws and speech codes that explicitly censor \"obscene\" or \"annoying\" content. What the FCC is calling \"Net Neutrality\" is actually just a massive regulatory move that will give the FCC extremely high control and authority over what kinds of communication are allowed and disallowed on the (until now) open internet. Let's not forget the FCC's [horrible track record on our First Amendment rights.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censorship_in_the_United_States)\n\nThe censorship portion of the Law is under Section 223. [But don't take my word on it, read the Law itself.](https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf)\n\n\n&gt;(a) Whoever-- (1) in interstate or foreign communications-- (A) by means of a telecommunications device knowingly-- (i) makes, creates, or solicits, and (ii) initiates the transmission of, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication which is obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, or indecent, with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass another person;\n\n...\n\n&gt;(C) makes a telephone call or utilizes a telecommunications device, whether or not conversation or communication ensues, without disclosing his identity and with intent to annoy, abuse, threaten, or harass any person at the called number or who receives the communications;\n\n...\n\n&gt;(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under his control to be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be used for such activity, shall be fined under title 18, United States Code, or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.\n\nLet's get something else straight: it's not *just* ISPs that have a dog in this fight. Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Conde Nast, **all of whom censor content,** are pro-Net Neutrality. **The idea that Title II will somehow prevent censorship is insane - we already have censorship on the internet and Title II will do absolutely nothing to stop Google/Facebook/Twatter/Conde Nast from censoring whatever they feel like censoring.** In fact, the \"Net Neutrality\" passed down by the FCC does exactly what people say it's supposed to prevent - censorship - and it's important to cut through the bullshit and expose what's really going on here, which is one corporate lobby (websites) astroturfing public opinion to get a different corporate lobby (ISPs) to do them a favor by not throttling their traffic. \n\nThe FCC [was already enforcing a version of Net Neutrality before Title II.](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2008/08/fcc-rules-against-comcast-bit-torrent-blocking) Source Document [Here](https://apps.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/FCC-05-151A1.pdf), a memo from all the way back in 2005. Remind me why we need Title II with its censorship laws, to protect us from censorship, again??\n\nGive me a fucking break. This is bait and switch - get a censorship Law applied to the internet and call it \"Net Neutrality,\" fearmonger/astroturf until the public willingly accepts it. \"OH NO! COMCAST IS COMING FOR MY NETFLIX!!!\" \n\nThey could pass literally anything and call it \"Net Neutrality\" and reddit would eat it up like the idiots they are, because some anonymous post with +590190818 upvotes told them it was a good idea."}, {"comment_id": "dk48a0h", "post_id": "6msxrx", "comment": "I checked what my internet usage is.\n\nTypical video game on steam is 20 to 30 GB's download, plus a 2 gig patch.\n\nBlack Desert Online patch sizes are about 2 gigs.\n\nI stream Sling TV on 3 tv's.

As the so called \"greatest nation in the world\" why we don't already have or are in the process of having fiber built to every home is mind boggling. \n\nSo, instead of upgrading their network to enlarged their pipes, they'd rather just throttle and cap everyone because the day to day demands of the internet is exponentially growing and they cannot keep up.

The internet has and always should be an open environment, if the internet wasn't neutral as it always has been, things like Netflix, Amazon, Google, and YouTube would have been crushed by the early internet companies that failed to innovate and evolve. Can you imagine if AOL and AskJeeves were able to use anti-competitive proceedings like the \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" one that lays before us today. The internet would still be dial-up and the power to connect the world's greatest innovators would be a fraction of what it is today. Without Net Neutrality the largest internet service providers can squeeze small online startups and destroy the American entrepreneurial spirit. To me this proceeding is the most anti-American proposal to rail against internet and as a citizen I ask that you respect the internet and the public. The largest ISPs that have reached out to the FCC are only self-serving and do not care about the millions of Americans who use the internet everyday, some of us in order to do our jobs."}, {"comment_id": "dk46fzz", "post_id": "6msxrx", "comment": "I voted in this.

There was no actual automated means to cancel your sub online at their website.\n\nI spent almost 2 hours on the phone to cancel my subscription. I had a long wait time, followed by a slow conversation with an outsourced phone-tech who barely spoke English. I had to call back a 2nd time, because I was hung up on. The 1st person didn\u2019t want to cancel my sub, and they weren\u2019t able to talk me into keeping it. \n\nI\u2019ve never gone back to Xbox since then.

I paid full price for the game, I should receive the full game at launch. It's not a hard concept to grasp. This problem only pisses me off more when I think about the fact that Call of Duty is a game that is released on a yearly schedule, which means that most of the players that I would be playing with will have moved on to other games by the time I ever even see the content that I paid full price for.

For example, playing only 50% of the hours needed to unlock everything might actually unlock 80% of the content. However, unlocking things through purchase seems to generally be more linear, so paying 50% of the total cost of buying everything would get you about 50% of the content.\n\nIs this the case? I haven't played SWB2, and I really have no intention of doing so. However, it kind of makes a pretty big difference if things are unlocked on a line or a curve, because it would mean the amount of money needed to unlock the remaining content would fall much faster than the number of hours needed.\n\nI'm just asking because, if so, then just presenting these two extreme limiting cases (i.e. hours only and money only) would be both unrealistic and misleading."}, {"comment_id": "dputxun", "post_id": "7d3jnc", "comment": "See I\u2019m of the side that as long as I can play it and unlock stuff.

I don't think I ever played Halo 1 again after seeing that.  He passed away suddenly 10 years ago at age 26, so I feel your pain.

I was really really sad, when Split Screen wasn't a part of Halo 5, because of that. Nowadays we don't play any games together, but I hope with Infinite, that'll change.\n\nI don't know, what you're going through but I can imagine the fun you had with your bro while playing those wonderful games.

Long story short, they tricked me into going over to one of my friend's house to help move a fridge only for me to get there to see everyone sitting there intervention style.

No of course not. Disney stepped in and told them to change it only after the public backlash. They were only trying to protect their brand, if they could have gotten away with it I'm sure they would have.\n\nNo doubt in my mind that in this instance EA presented what they had for this game and both EA and Disney done analysis and made projections and came to the conclusion that it wasnt worth their time and money based on the potential returns.\n\nThey are publicly traded companies, their main objective is to increase revenue for stakeholders.

I used to play counter-strike when I was 13. I would spend hours after school on that game and finally got onto a team of older players, all in their late teens early 20's. I spent many nights playing with these guys in leagues and scrims all throughout high school, we even got sponsored at one point but I was under age and had to leave the team as I could not travel. My friend Paul who was the older play on the team eventually stopped playing due to having kids. I was out of school at this point and working while going to college part time, started playing league of legends with Paul for a couple hours every night, played a few different games with him. I finally get engaged to my beautiful wife ( I am 25 y/o at this point in my life )  She has a step brother who lives in California, we live in Washington State. We go visit her brother and I tell Paul I will be in his state on the set date, well turns out where I was visiting Paul only lives 20 minutes away. He drove out and met me for the first time in 11 years. He was much shorter than I expected I am 6'3 and he is about 5'9 but the chemistry was unhindered of the awkwardness of meeting someone for the first time, we got Whiskey drunk and reminisced on old stories. Long story short I asked him to be one of the groomsmen in my wedding and forced him to fly to Washington State and be there for our big day! I got married when I was 26 we had an incredible time. We still talk and play games to this day ( 31 years old now ) but its not as often as we both have family we need to take care of, but its been an amazing friendship for almost 16 years!"}, {"comment_id": "ewjcyi4", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "Real life Mario and Luigi"}, {"comment_id": "ewjdghk", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "\"dude I dont have uno\"\n\n\n\"YOU HAVE UNOOOOOOO\""}, {"comment_id": "ewjk4yl", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "Aw"}, {"comment_id": "ewjqykp", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "bUt ViDeO gAmEs CaUsE vIoLeNcE, nOt FrIeNdShIpS!"}, {"comment_id": "ewk0t06", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "Bro how much ganja you smoke."}, {"comment_id": "ewk427o", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "This is awesome"}, {"comment_id": "ewk4rwz", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "One of you dudes looks so high."}, {"comment_id": "ewk5opp", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "YOU HAVE UNO"}, {"comment_id": "ewk9pva", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "damn y\u2019all are high as hell"}, {"comment_id": "ewkc8im", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "I don\u2019t even play and this is beautiful."}, {"comment_id": "ewkcqsx", "post_id": "coerl3", "comment": "I met one of my best friends playing Halo 3 on Last Resort.

No they're modeled after booster packs. Loot boxes don't occasionally (as in 90% of the time) give you nothing. Loot boxes can be earned for free. Loot boxes don't contain cash. Loot boxes aren't served with an open bar in proximity. People who addicted to video games generally spend too much TIME.\n\nOh but wait; they have flashing lights and colors that makes them slot machines /s.

It's almost as if the dangers of marketing 'ebil skary gambling' to children aren't and haven't been real societal issues.\n\n>Unlike carnival games, collecting cards, or similar purchases of chance, videogames require active, lengthy participation during which consumers are exposed to psychological manipulation techniques which can result in real addiction and harm.\n\nOh so he doesn't have a real reason, just conjecture \"It's worse, trust me they use flashing lights\". Is this guys really saying that carnival games don't manipulate the odds of winning to take advantage of people? MTG checks off more red flags for gambling than any Overwatch loot box EVER did. You can literally turn magic cards into cash. Some people don't even play MTG for the game, they literally just collect/sell the cards.\n\nVote with your wallet. Don't buy games with lootboxes.

I'm glad what this man did for this person, he had no reason to and that's so wonderful and just reminded me of my friend.

Is there ever any deals on it, when I play my nerves act up in my hands and assigning sdtuff to the bottom buttons would be truly a miracle, I'm willing to forgo a planned trip to Chicago to get one because this has been such a welcome escape. Is the elite controller worth it for those of us with mild disabilities?  Also just so nobody thinks this is bullshit and a plea for some help, this is what I was gaming on before recieving the Xbox One in the hospital getting a EEG, MRI, and finding out I have MS. https://imgur.com/a/1MBXn9I This is what I was gaming on before my friend gifted me the Xbox One and basically changed my life and depression from finding out I had MS and Seizures.

My cousin, who has enjoyed the introduction of the copilot to play Farming Simulator amongst other titles such as Red Ded Redemption; he suffers with autism and although it is not seen as a physical disability he has difficulty controlling his right hand and so co pilot helped him when his dad was around to help out!\n\nAfter seeing this we are blown away, as parents and members of the family this is game changing and will make it our very duty to own these as soon as we can; thank you Xbox and to every one behind the R&D of this magnificent controller. It will definitely make things easier for the many different people that struggle with a physical disability, we are thankful for the opportunity to make gaming on xbox much more inviting for everyone!\n\nWith love, \n\nA not so perfect family of gamers.

This was around 2009. I had a job that was inconsistent and money was tight while we prioritized my stepdaughter and her needs.\n\nWe chose a private school for a better education and sacrificed every spare dollar to keep her in it and up to date with extra-curricular stuff.\n\nI had lost a bunch of weight (due to what I know now was mild malnutrition). I worked nights to pay the rent and days to pay the rest. My wife\u2019s at-home business had just opened and it was doing what every new business does at first: Losing money. But we had bought Christmas presents for our daughter and that was all that mattered.\n\nI didn\u2019t think it was that obvious how broke we were. It was a season, and it was tough. But we were determined and knew good things were around the corner. \n\nA parent at the private school had asked me a few questions about work and how stuff was going when I picked up my daughter. I told her things were good but Christmas being around the corner meant we were tightening our belts and that it was going to be a quiet day at home. These were the type of people that spent the holidays in tropical climates, so I thought I was explaining how \u201cnormal\u201d people looked at the holidays. \n\nFast forward to Christmas Day and \u201csomebody\u201d knocked on our door. There was a mountain of gifts sitting there and nobody else. Some of the nicest clothes we had ever worn (all in the right sizes), an iPad for all of us, jewelry for my wife and daughter, and an Xbox 360 for me with a bunch of accessories. What was weird was that my 360 had just red-ringed 2 weeks before. Somehow they knew.\n\nIt still brings me to tears thinking about it. I went to message the people I suspected were responsible and saw they were indeed on vacation in Hawaii. I still don\u2019t know what they did to make it happen.\n\nMy fortunes have vastly changed. In between Christmas and New Year\u2019s of that year, I was offered an excellent position that helped us get out of renting and into owning a house. My wife\u2019s home business is even *more* profitable than that, recently turning into a million dollar company (in business volume). \n\nWe are able to now return the favour extended to us every Christmas. My 5 year old son is super excited to make Christmas special for a boy or girl less fortunate than us. My step-daughter is 19 and picks a colleague or friend to spoil anonymously. My wife and I keep a tradition of not buying each other large gifts and instead remember that one particular year by choosing a different charity and donating anonymously. \n\n**All this is to say that you are a hero, OP.**\n\nGod bless you and yours this Christmas. You never know the ball you get rolling. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "eb95zn6", "post_id": "a3rrl3", "comment": "I got some Xbox One games laying around I no longer play.

Turned the fan back on, there it is again. Wherever the fan was pointing as it oscillated, that was where the sound was coming from.

I'm gonna throw a quick disclaimer just in case. \n\n* I do not work for Microsoft or any Microsoft related brands and I'm just here to provide my educated opinion.\n\nThis a simple case of miscommunication. Because it was easier to call paypal and let them put in a dispute for you, the system will receive a \"friendly missed charge\" and in detail it will say that it's for \"item not as described\" under your account. This is an automated system that will automatically put your account on \"hold\" [address, phone#, email, credit card, device and IP for all the transactions in your history are blocked] this is a security procedure in the case that this was an account used to make fraudulent transactions. No human has touch your account and are not aware of your situation. Now you called MS and a rep is telling you that they are gonna process your refund, (This should have the  first thing to do) they submit a claim with the financial dept to process it but now they see that account has been put on hold for that transaction and they ain't gonna process nothing because of the dispute. \n\nNow we are here, blocked and sad. The next step is to put in a claim with the \"dispute department\" and have the \"chargeback coordinator\" review your account. This normally takes a few days because the dispute department is only run by 1 or 2 coordinators.(for security purposes)\n\nThey will most likely ask you to contact paypal and reverse the dispute in the merchant's favor and they will issue a refund like it was meant to be.  \n\nThis happens a lot and we cannot have a human review each one as it comes. Please be patient with phone reps as they do not possess any information or control on the \"block\".  Always ask to speak to a supervisor for the best information.( they cannot remove the \"block\")\n\nI'm making breakfast and typing this on my phone.

Take Amazon prime for example, i don't know anyone that pays for Prime for just the movie service, or just the music service, or just the photo service, but use all three because they already pay for it. Now of course, if a company does one thing well, you go to them for it, like Netflix. MS has too many fingers in too many pots to do any one thing well, but they do have a broad range of ok services.  Google is the same way, all their separate services die off pretty quick. No one is buying youtube red for no ads alone, but play music and youtube red bundled is pretty enticing. \n\nImagine if they offered something called \"MS Premium\", which included xbox live, groove music, and 1 tb of onedrive for $10/month (instead of the $60/year for xbox alone), how many current xbox live users alone would drop their music service since its included here?
