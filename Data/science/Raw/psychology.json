The male warrior hypothesis proposes that success in intergroup contests has been vital in human evolution and that men therefore must engage in maximally effective intragroup cooperation [ 1\u20133 ]. Post-conflict affiliation between opponents is further proposed to facilitate future cooperation [ 4 ], which has been demonstrated in non-human primates [ 5 ] and humans [ 6 ]. The sex that invests more in post-conflict affiliation, therefore, should cooperate more. Supportive evidence comes from chimpanzees, a close genetic relative to humans that also engages in male intergroup aggression [ 7 ]. Here we apply this principle to humans by testing the hypothesis that among members of a large community, following a conflict, males are predisposed to be more ready than females to repair their relationship via friendly contact. **We took high-level sports matches as a proxy for intragroup conflict, because they occur within a large organization and constitute semi-naturalistic, standardized, aggressive, and intense confrontations. Duration or frequency of peaceful physical contacts served as the measure of post-conflict affiliation because they are strongly associated with pro-social intentions [ 8, 9 ].** Across tennis, table tennis, badminton, and boxing, with participants from 44 countries, duration of post-conflict affiliation was longer for males than females. Our results indicate that unrelated human males are more predisposed than females to invest in a behavior, post-conflict affiliation, that is expected to facilitate future intragroup cooperation.\n\n---\nNow I don't know about you, but I'm pretty skeptical about concluding from this study that this may explain, even \"in part,\" why men dominate the workplace.

Most U.S. states have arbitrary age cutoffs for entry into public school. Therefore, within the same grade, children with birthdays close to the cutoff date can differ in age by nearly 1 year.\n\nMETHODS\nWe used data from 2007 through 2015 from a large insurance database to compare the rate of ADHD diagnosis among children born in August with that among children born in September in states with and states without the requirement that children be 5 years old by September 1 for enrollment in kindergarten. ADHD diagnosis was determined on the basis of diagnosis codes from the International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision. We also used prescription records to compare ADHD treatment between children born in August and children born in September in states with and states without the cutoff date of September 1.\n\nRESULTS\nThe study population included 407,846 children in all U.S. states who were born in the period from 2007 through 2009 and were followed through December 2015. The rate of claims-based ADHD diagnosis among children in states with a September 1 cutoff was 85.1 per 10,000 children (309 cases among 36,319 children; 95% confidence interval [CI], 75.6 to 94.2) among those born in August and 63.6 per 10,000 children (225 cases among 35,353 children; 95% CI, 55.4 to 71.9) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 21.5 per 10,000 children (95% CI, 8.8 to 34.0); the corresponding difference in states without the September 1 cutoff was 8.9 per 10,000 children (95% CI, \u221214.9 to 20.8). The rate of ADHD treatment was 52.9 per 10,000 children (192 of 36,319 children; 95% CI, 45.4 to 60.3) among those born in August and 40.4 per 10,000 children (143 of 35,353 children; 95% CI, 33.8 to 47.1) among those born in September, an absolute difference of 12.5 per 10,000 children (95% CI, 2.43 to 22.4). These differences were not observed for other month-to-month comparisons, nor were they observed in states with non-September cutoff dates for starting kindergarten. In addition, in states with a September 1 cutoff, no significant differences between August-born and September-born children were observed in rates of asthma, diabetes, or obesity.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nRates of diagnosis and treatment of ADHD are higher among children born in August than among children born in September in states with a September 1 cutoff for kindergarten entry.

I am also a patient researcher and this study has some major flaws. It's also being repromoted today by the journal again, months after publication. (so if this comment should be in a current thread on reddit, feel free to move it, I'm newish here, still learning norms)\n\nThe problem is that this study has very very low levels of diagnosis, in each group, compared to the actual levels seen in populations worldwide. (See my note on genetics, below) Some reasons for lower numbers of diagnosis include shame of family, bigotry by schools and general public, media. Other reasons are that families move kids to private schools, thinking that will \"cure\" them, families pay for private diagnosis and don't claim assessment on insurance, or they get private tutoring/therapy for their child. \n\nIt's still abnormally tiny numbers, compared to the 3-4000 children I'd expect out of 100,000. That tells me that something else was wrong. Eg, large numbers of school districts have cut off dates of December 31. But we don't see the same differences. Possibly these researchers were able to show a difference among the months, by ending data gathering when they hit the numbers they wanted. \n\nLargest failures: 1) The study fails to mention that all of the standardized assessments for children, for autism, ADHD, and other developmental differences have different graduated scores per month and year. Eg. A child age 4 years 11 months will score differently than a child age 5 years 10 months and they design it that way, and take it into account. All assessments by a professional takes into account the differences in ages by months and years.\n\n2) They used insurance records, and educational institutional assessments but they also failed to note that qualifying for insurance coverage or social security disability assistance requires direct professional observation and assessment by people who are trained to know the difference between hyper and normal energy. \n\n3) The study also fails to discuss that large international genetic studies with independently confirmed assessments of both neurotypical kids and related adults and non-neurotypical kids and related adults have shown that the natural background rate of Autism is about 1 to 1.5 % and ADHD is about 7%. The same studies showed that autism, schizophrenia, bipolar, and adhd all share a similar group of genes. Which explains why all these conditions are often seen in the same families and why many people have more than one condition.\n\n4) The hockey example is an anecdote from a book, not a scientific citation, and the other ones cited have the exact same issues I have mentioned here. Replicating a well done study is important, but repeating studies with the same flaws and failures, over and over, is a waste of money. \n\n5) It's an NIH publicly funded study, so it should be publicly available to read the entire study and yet it's behind an expensive paywall. And today, it was repromoted by Medpage Today, for the second time, months later. None of the press releases or publicly available articles in MT or Science Daily or WP mentioned these major issues with the study. No criticism at all actually.\n\n6) The examples given on this thread's comments about ADHD and foster care and adoption and PTSD reflect genetics, underdiagnosis and undertreatment in girls and women, who then have problems parenting because they have poorer executive function and once a family is in the CAS system, every generation after that is  likely to be in it as well. Because being raised in foster care means you are automatically watched while pregnant and CAS is more likely to seize your kids at birth. It's a cycle. Also, children with developmental delays, poor behaviour, lower impulse control and or learning disabilities are more likely to be abused (if not physically then emotionally) as a method of home and school discipline. The solution is to ensure that the entire family has assessment and some form of treatment, not just the kid. \nSo they are more likely to experience mental health issues as a result of trauma. Again, that doesn't mean the child doesn't have ADHD or autism -- it means the child has ADHD or autism PLUS a mental health issue and all need treatment.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "ehrt2xh", "post_id": "a1g7j7", "comment": "I wish this study was revealed when i first got into school "}, {"comment_id": "eapw4uq", "post_id": "a1g7j7", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eaq15yo", "post_id": "a1g7j7", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eaqditt", "post_id": "a1g7j7", "comment": "That sure goes a long way in disproving the theory that doctors handed out the diagnosis like candy in the 90s.\n\n/s"}, {"comment_id": "eaqmi2w", "post_id": "a1g7j7", "comment": "I have ADHD and I've never really felt out of place ever.

I have been on the board of three independent public schools.  I see an interesting pattern:\n\n\nFirst, teachers\u2019 unions are Big Business. They exist on the dues garnered from members, involuntarily deducted from teacher paycheques.  In order to justify these involuntary contributions, unions relentlessly flood their members with propaganda about how poorly they\u2019re being treated.  \n\n\nThe union insists that teachers are horribly stressed. They insist classrooms are overcrowded.  They wax endlessly about burnout and terrible working conditions.  \n\n\nIt becomes a self-fulfilling prophesy. \n\n\nThis is not an unusual MO for unions, but what makes teachers\u2019 unions unique is that despite all their posturing, they actually take very few steps to solve any problems.  Why would they?  \n\n\nAs long as members keep paying unions to champion their cause, the unions will ensure the cause remains unchanged.  \n\n\nEvery time a teachers\u2019 union contract wanes, the union ramps up its campaign of \u201cyou teachers work far too hard, are terribly stressed and don\u2019t get paid enough.\u201d  It\u2019s predictable and nauseating how much energy and money they pour into these ads in all forms of media. \n\n\nWhat happens at the end of negotiating a new contract?  In my experience, every single time and without exception, class sizes remain the same, and teacher responsibilities are unchanged. What does change is the amount of money teachers are paid.\n\n\nThat\u2019s all.  Just the money.  This is exactly what the union wants, because it increases their dues.  The last thing a teachers\u2019 union wants is to remove the problems they use to justify their existence. \n\n\nIn my family, there are 2 union teachers and 2 independent teachers. They teach the same levels, in similar neighbourhoods, with the same class sizes for the same number of hours and for roughly the same pay.  The ONLY difference is that the union teachers are under a constant barrage of statements about how much stress they\u2019re in and how poorly done by they are.  Isn\u2019t this abusive?\n\n\nYes, I sound cynical. No, I\u2019m not anti union. However, I am appalled at the ongoing, constant abuse showered upon members by unions.

Such naive beliefs are important because they guide actual goal-directed behaviors. In a series of studies across five countries on three continents, we found that people mainly believed either that obesity is caused by a lack of exercise or that it is caused by a poor diet. Moreover, laypeople who indicted a lack of exercise were more likely to actually be overweight than were those who implicated a poor diet. This effect held even after controlling for several known correlates of body mass index (BMI), thereby explaining previously unexplained variance. We also experimentally demonstrated the mechanism underlying this effect: People who implicated insufficient exercise tended to consume more food than did those who indicted a poor diet.

Edits, formatting\n\n> When a man explodes in anger over something seemingly insignificant, he may appear like just a jerk. But he could be anxious.\n\n> Anxiety problems can look different in men. When people think of anxiety, they may picture the excessive worry and avoidance of frightening situations that often plague those who suffer. These afflict men, too. But there\u2019s a growing recognition among psychologists that men are more likely to complain of headaches, difficulty sleeping and muscle aches and pains. They are more likely to use alcohol and drugs to cope with anxiety, so what looks like a drinking problem may actually be an underlying anxiety disorder. And anxiety in men often manifests as anger and irritability.\n\n> Anxious \u201cmen may present as loose cannons, but they are worriers,\u201d says Kevin Chapman, a clinical psychologist in Louisville, Ky. \u201cAggression tends to be more socially acceptable to many men than anxiety.\u201d\n\n> Studies have found that about one in five men (and about one in three women) will have an anxiety disorder during their lifetime. But psychologists are increasingly concerned that those numbers underreport male cases.\n\n> This is particularly worrisome now that more research is finding a link between anxiety and suicide. Depression is the mental illness most strongly associated with suicidal thoughts, but it doesn\u2019t often lead to suicidal acts, according to a 2010 study by researchers at Harvard University and Harvard Medical School. Instead it is anxiety disorders, along with substance abuse and conduct disorder, that are most strongly associated with suicide attempts; the link between anxiety and suicide has been echoed in more recent studies as well. Men are more than three times more likely to die by suicide than women, and suicide rates are on the rise in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n> \u201cPeople who are panicky and have a desire to escape from a situation they perceive to be intolerable, that could be the spark to act on their [suicidal] thoughts,\u201d says Matthew K. Nock, a psychology professor at Harvard and an author of the study.\n\n> In general, men are less likely to receive treatment for mental health issues. \u201cWe\u2019ve been socialized from a very young age to see emotional vulnerability as a weakness,\u201d says Michael Addis, a professor of psychology and director of the Men\u2019s Well-Being Research Group at Clark University in Worcester, Mass. \u201cSeeking help is seen as a sign of weakness as well,\u201d for some men.\n\n> Men may present as loose cannons, but they are worriers \u2014Kevin Chapman, a clinical psychologist in Louisville, Ky.\nAnxiety is a normal human emotion, of course. But it becomes a disorder when it is so severe and constant that it impairs a person\u2019s life, interfering with work and relationships. Anxiety disorders and depression often occur together. The most well-researched and effective treatments for anxiety disorders are cognitive behavioral therapy, which teaches patients to alter problematic thinking that fuels anxiety and to actively approach situations they fear, and antidepressant medications like Prozac and Lexapro.\n\n> Aaron California had been anxious since childhood: He avoided parties and had intense anxiety before taking tests. At 19, he realized that anxiety was \u201cruining my life,\u201d says Mr. California, now 31 years old and an aide in Moscow, Idaho, for people with disabilities. \u201cIt caused me to drop out [of college]. I ended up quitting my job,\u201d because he was so afraid of making mistakes. Still, he resisted getting treatment because of \u201cthe stigma of being judged by others,\u201d he says.\n\n> Men often seek treatment after a work crisis\u2014or, especially, at the urging of a partner. But what is the best way to encourage a man to get help for anxiety? One thing not to do is deliver an ultimatum: That can lead to a power struggle and actually increase someone\u2019s resistance to treatment. Instead, \u201chighlight that their quality of life is suffering,\u201d says Dean McKay, a psychology professor at Fordham University in New York and a past president of the Association for Behavioral and Cognitive Therapies. Tell your loved one that with effective treatment, \u201cyou\u2019ll enjoy stuff so much more. We can enjoy each other more if you are able to manage this thing. That is pretty compelling.\u201d\n\n> SHARE YOUR THOUGHTS\nDo you or does someone you know struggle with anxiety? What, if anything, has been helpful? Join the conversation below.\n\n> Dr. Addis suggests expressing your own distress about your loved one\u2019s suffering, how you\u2019re worrying, how you\u2019re not sleeping. And above all, be compassionate. \u201cRather than seeing him as a sort of stubborn, unwilling typical man, try to start seeing them as a human being not only anxious and depressed but struggling with what they expect of themselves and what society expects of them,\u201d he says.\n\n> Avoiding diagnostic labels may also help. Dr. McKay doesn\u2019t mention the word anxiety during the first couple of therapy sessions with some men. Dr. Chapman says some of his patients are more comfortable calling treatment \u201ccoaching\u201d or \u201chelp with performance\u201d that is focused on \u201cdistress at work.\u201d\n\n> Many men, of course, are comfortable discussing their emotions and using terms like anxiety and depression. Still, short-term, goal-oriented treatments that focus on changing behavior, like cognitive behavioral therapy, might be more palatable for many men. CBT usually involves 12 to 15 weekly sessions. \u201cA more practical approach, a more coaching-oriented approach is going to feel more familiar to a lot of men,\u201d says Dr. Addis. \u201cIt\u2019s not a lot different than getting a golf lesson.\u201d\n\n\n> John Borders, a 54-year-old lawyer, struggled with panic attacks and obsessive thoughts; his wife convinced him to see a therapist. PHOTO: CHRISTINE MUELLER PHOTOGRAPHY\nJohn Borders had been struggling with panic attacks and troubling obsessive thoughts for years before his wife convinced him to see a therapist for anxiety and obsessive compulsive disorder. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand what was going on in my mind,\u201d said Mr. Borders, a 54-year-old lawyer in Louisville. He then had two brief stints of therapy that he says weren\u2019t very helpful before he started CBT and exposure and response prevention treatment (a version of CBT that is used for OCD) with Dr. Chapman. At that point, Mr. Borders had an intense fear of driving on highways. \u201cMy heart would race. I\u2019d think I was going to run off the road.\u201d So Dr. Chapman had Mr. Borders drive on highways, and, to up the anxiety symptoms even more, do so after drinking coffee. \u201cI would drink a double shot of espresso and get on the highway and drive,\u201d said Mr. Borders. \u201cThat really helped.\u201d\n\n> Mindfulness practices like meditation can also be effective, and particularly useful for men who express a lot of frustration and anger in response to anxiety. Meditation \u201cslows you down. You can make choices of action that are more premeditated,\u201d says Douglas Mennin, a professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University Teachers College. Dr. Mennin also encourages group therapy, which can counteract the social isolation and loneliness that some men feel\u2014and that can make anxiety worse.\n\n> Mr. California did get cognitive behavioral therapy and took medication. While he still deals with anxiety, he largely recovered and finished college and a master\u2019s degree in educational psychology. Opening up to his co-workers and developing friendships, he says, has been critical, too. \u201cBeing able to talk to someone is anxiety-reducing,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s meant a tremendous amount to me to feel a sense of love and belonging where I\u2019m no longer alone.\u201d\n\n> How to Help\n> \u2014Don\u2019t deliver an ultimatum. This can lead to a power struggle and increase his resistance to treatment. Instead, highlight ways his quality of life could improve with treatment.\n\n> \u2014Convey your own distress about his suffering\u2014how you are worrying about him.\n\n> \u2014Be compassionate. Don\u2019t view him as being stubborn, see him as a human being who is struggling with a heavy burden of expectations.\n\n> \u2014Avoid diagnostic labels. Using the word \u201canxiety\u201d could make him uncomfortable."}, {"comment_id": "evgug6o", "post_id": "cjt514", "comment": "I have severe anxiety as a man; in social settings if I'm overly anxious, I look so angry/serious some people take that the wrong way and assume I'm a psychopath.

Drawing from Dunbar\u2019s social brain hypothesis and Communicate Bond Belong theory, friendship status was examined as a function of hours together, shared activities, and everyday talk. In Study 1, MTurk participants (N = 355) who had recently relocated estimated time spent with a new acquaintance. Hours together was associated with closer friendships. Time spent engaging in leisure activities also predicted closeness. In Study 2, first-year students (N = 112) reported the number of hours spent with two new acquaintances three times over 9 weeks. Hours together was associated changes in closeness between waves.

Self-ratings of political skill correlated significantly with supervisor ratings, suggesting that people are quite good at judging their own political skills, or at least able to get others to see them as politically skilled.

In this study, an indirect effect chain model was tested which proposes that dark employees receive good performance ratings through political skill. Dark personality was operationalized by low scores on the honesty-humility factor of the HEXACO personality model. One hundred and ten employees provided self-ratings on honesty-humility and political skill. Their supervisors provided observer ratings on political skill and job performance. Results show a positive direct effect of honesty-humility on the performance measure of team facilitation and support at the same time the opposing indirect effect hypothesis: Dark, as opposed to honest-humble, employees are more likely to view themselves as politically skilled, and when equally perceived as politically skilled by their supervisors, they receive higher ratings on task performance and team facilitation.

Given this preference, people wishing to be chosen can either increase their own cooperation to become more desirable or suppress others\u2019 cooperation to make them less desirable. Previous research shows that very cooperative people sometimes get punished (\u201cantisocial punishment\u201d) or criticized (\u201cdo-gooder derogation\u201d) in many cultures. Here, we used a public-goods game with punishment to test whether antisocial punishment is used as a means of competing to be chosen by suppressing others\u2019 cooperation. As predicted, there was more antisocial punishment when participants were competing to be chosen for a subsequent cooperative task (a trust game) than without a subsequent task. This difference in antisocial punishment cannot be explained by differences in contributions, moralistic punishment, or confusion. This suggests that antisocial punishment is a social strategy that low cooperators use to avoid looking bad when high cooperators escalate cooperation.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "e2s2crh", "post_id": "90ojc0", "comment": "Tall Poppy Syndrome "}, {"comment_id": "e2s41n0", "post_id": "90ojc0", "comment": "Not surprising, it makes other people feel shame, thus \"tear them down\" is easier than attempting to do the same"}, {"comment_id": "e2s6yqz", "post_id": "90ojc0", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e2sf53p", "post_id": "90ojc0", "comment": "Well this is disheartening"}, {"comment_id": "e2s55fg", "post_id": "90ojc0", "comment": "this is cultural norm in Sweden.

We are all different and have different preferences. In freedom we can pursue those desires, and often that plays a large role in the functionality of society; everyone pursues different life/career paths and this we end up with people who are entrepreneurs, engineers, plumbers, painters and musicians, lawyers and real estate agents. Do we encounter struggles? Of course. But just because someone isn't pooping rainbows 24/7 doesn't mean they're not overall, generally happy. And this individuality of happiness is why they can't nail down a specific scientific construct of happiness. It's a subjective construct. We imagine in each of our own minds what happiness looks like to us. For one person it may be a room full of puppies and a huge salary, for someone else it may be bondage and torture. The second gripe I have with this article is their failure to recognize the evolution of society along with the evolution of humans. As civilization has advanced, it has allowed us the luxury of being increasingly absorbed in depressive states. So yes, nature has not \"weeded out depression\" (or however it was phrased in the article) but the advancement of society almost seems to be directly correlated with increases in depression. We're adapting to our environment and particularly in American culture where the victim seems to garner the most attention as of late, it would only make sense that depression would increase (and has). So maybe the unhappiness that they're observing is a byproduct of our evolution and adaptation to modern society. Maybe, had life continued as it was, depression may have not been \"weeded out\" but it may not be so prevalent. It would seem to me depression is a distraction from productivity, and would be evolutionarily detrimental.

We examined how psychopathic traits relate to political affiliation and opinions on political issues, using the triarchic conceptualization of psychopathy (Patrick, Fowles, & Krueger, 2009) and testing empathy components as mediators. Interpersonal-affective (Boldness and Meanness) traits were higher in Republicans compared to Democrats. Moreover, Boldness was associated with conservative opinions on economic issues, while Meanness evinced stronger relations to conservative opinions on social issues. Triarchic domains also evidenced unique associations to issues concerning minorities or discrimination. Further, empathy mediated relations between Meanness and decreased support for certain issues (e.g., affirmative action). Overall, psychopathy, particularly the interpersonal-affective traits, appear pertinent to political attitudes, while empathy deficits may statistically account for unique effects of Meanness."}, {"comment_id": "e9ilyvv", "post_id": "9w7eda", "comment": "The hypothesis is not so far fetched, i can see how right leaning voters could appear to be meaner, in how they often value and prioritize  culture, history, close family and them selves.

So  only a very small minority made a different choice (7%), compared to control. This pretty much invalidates the title: \"Teens reject junk food when healthy eating is framed as rebellion\". \n\nAlso, since the study only tested choices 1 day post-treatment, we don't know anything about long-term effects. What are their choices 1 week after the intervention? 1 month? 1 year? Do they need to be reminded in frequent intervals for the treatment to work? What about contexts outside of school? \n\nInteresting quote (from the [original study](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/39/10830.abstract)):\n\n> Adolescents are sometimes characterized as concerned only with short-term selfish aims, but recent developmental science high- lights that this is a period of increased concern for social justice and beyond-the-self aims (15, 16). This phenomenon is instantiated by attraction to social movements such as vegetarianism or antiglobalization activism (17) and is tied to neural and endocrine system developments that heighten attention to unfairness (18) and create a greater concern for finding meaning in life (19). This attention to social justice often manifests as reactance against authorities (e.g., parents and teachers); adolescents are often highly motivated to avoid being seen as aligned with the interests of unjust adult authorities. But it can also manifest as a more general condemnation of societal unfairness and motivate prosocial action to address that unfairness (16). The opportunity to have a meaningful impact on the world beyond the self can create a powerful feeling of eudaimonic reward in the immediate term (15 \u2013 17, 19)."}, {"comment_id": "d904bzf", "post_id": "58fy62", "comment": "It's nice that being rebellious works both ways.

Mental health is important. But the [Aurora shooter had been talking to mental health professionals.](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/27/us/before-gunfire-in-colorado-theater-hints-of-bad-news-about-james-holmes.html) He was in an environment of highly educated people and he himself was part of a discipline related to mental health (neuroscience) so his situation, judging from his ease of access to mental health information and presumed lack of social stigma in his surroundings, couldn't have been more ideal. Yet he still killed. \n\nI don't know what to think about this. The NYT article is quite a good read and even mentions that one of the mental health professionals he was seeing alerted the university campus' threat assessment and security teams. And yet he still murdered twelve people. \n\nOf course he could be considered an aberration but then the same could be said about the murderer in Connecticut.  \n\nI genuinely can't form an opinion on this issue. Yes, mental health is important and we need more of it but I don't know if extreme forms of violence are one of the reasons why we need it. Maybe these people are by definition so far outside of \"society\" that any societal attempts at offering them help is ultimately futile. Of course we don't hear about those who don't end the lives of other human beings because they received adequate help but the fact that these criminals still exist may hint at there being no such thing as adequate help for some of them - at least not according to our current definition of adequate help. \n\nThe thing is, I believe that in a \"perfect\" world, neither the Connecticut murderer nor the Aurora shooter would have killed. I admit I'm biased when it comes to the nature/nurture debate but no amount of short alleles makes you pick up a gun and open fire on children. But this only means mental health isn't the answer, either. I personally believe in much more mental health being an overall positive thing for society and I also believe more restrictions on firearms would be helpful, too but neither of these opinions is based primarily on the actions of a select few. \n\nMaybe - and I know this line of thought is going beyond the area of psychology and ventures into the dreaded territory of philosophy - people like the Connecticut murderer are the price we pay as a society for our society. It is not a lack of mental health or gun control in the long run (although in the short term both could have had a helpful effect) but how we view people and their place in the world. \n\nSome of the defining factors of mental disorders are their impact on a person's functioning in society and the sufferer's deviance from social norms. I am mentally ill when I can't function according to society's understanding of the term and when I fail to behave like the majority. Maybe the problem really is that we accept a certain amount of violence and ignorance of other people's struggles as the societal standard.\n\nYes, this isn't much more than a slightly obscurantist claim that \"our society is sick\" and that we've become apathetic and removed from one another. But maybe this is where psychology can step back into the argument: maybe we don't need more mental health in the form of therapy for the ill but a more mentally healthy environment. \n\nMaybe the \"perfect\" world really is more like a therapist's office. We need to talk more and listen more and do so without judging or fearing the other's judgment or a loss of social status. Maybe we just need to give those people a reason to live: after all, despite their apparent delusions they must know that their lives, once they committed their atrocious deeds, will be, for all intents and purposes, over. After all, a large number of spree killers do either take their own lives or get the police to do it for them by not laying down their arms. \n\nWe need mental health in the sense that we need to make help accessible to those who are not ill. We need mental health in the sense that we should not even create an environment in which individuals run the risk of being so far removed from society that help is no longer an option. \n\nI dunno, I guess I'm just trying to make sense of it all.

You aren't ashamed to admit you have a cold and need to go to the doctor. We need to reach that place where we stop taking our mental health for granted and recognize that everyone's mind could do with a check up once in a while. Just as with the body, some lucky people don't have a pressing need to do this, but that shouldn't matter. There is preventative mental healthcare, and I think teaching CBT and coping strategies to everyone as a part of living a healthy overall lifestyle would go a long way towards improving our health, our culture, and our everyday lives."}, {"comment_id": "c7gvr82", "post_id": "14v69k", "comment": "I found this article in r/politics.

[It is Easier for Americans to Access Guns than Mental Health Services](http://thinkprogress.org/health/2012/12/14/1338021/its-easier-for-americans-to-access-guns-than-mental-health-services/?mobile=nc)\n\nThank you for making this post. I have been saying this all day. Many look at me like I defend the gunman when I say that he was sick (and really mean it).\n\nDoes admitting mental illness was a factor make a heinous crime less disturbing? If anything, it makes it more so. \n\nThe American narrative is too concerned with getting what one deserves. News flash: Bad things happen to good people. Good things happen to bad people. The universe is chaotic, it is not fair and just.\n\nWhen people venomously call someone sick or disturbed or psycho, we have to realize these words have meanings; darker, more tragic meanings than their face value colloquial meanings.\n\nCan I say that if the gunman received care today's tragidy would not have happened? No I cannot. But I can say that if our mental healthcare system was taken seriously, and the stigma was not so pressing, perhaps things could have been very different. \n\nAfter hugging your children, nieces and nephews, tell them that depression, anxiety, schizophrenia are all illnesses, not unlike the flu, that can be treated. My husband and I have pledged this understanding to our children. I hope more people do the ame.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "c7gwbf9", "post_id": "14v69k", "comment": "What I am interested in is why we *always* bring up gun control after the fact.

A reality of mental health care is that you cannot force anyone into treatment (i.e. psychiatric inpatient hospitalization) against their will unless they admit that they are a threat to themselves or others. One could very well harbor these intentions and keep it to themselves even if they are in therapy.\n\nWhat do individuals like these have in common? More often than not, they are isolated, misunderstood, angry, bullied, physically/emotionally/sexually abused or neglected by their caretakers, and have nowhere and no one to turn to. So instead of making this an argument about systemic issues that will take years, and probably decades, to even begin addressing, why not take some time out of your schedule and chat up the kid that everybody thinks is a loner and a weirdo? Have lunch with them, one on one. Play video games with them. Tell them your problems and frustrations too. Slowly, you will both begin to realize that you are not all that different - school sucks, friendships suck, peer pressure sucks, relationships suck, parents suck, finals suck.\n\nLo and behold, more socializing, feeling listened to and understood, having an outlet to vent, having someone on their side.

One of the biggest events that impact my childhood was watching 2 straight days of Columbine news coverage during my middle school years. I sat there mesmorized by the thought of how that school looked just like mine and those people looked like me. Now another generation has a tragedy to fixate on. \n\nI agree that the focus shouldn't be on Guns and should be more on the individual. I am not a gun rights advocate but seeing people fight over assault weapons and say shit like 'do we really need machine guns?' when those type of weapons are rarely used in these events... it's almost always pistols and they will always be accessible, easy to hide, and deadly enough to achieve as high a body count as someone chooses. A bullet to the head from a pistol destroys every bit as much flesh as one from an M4 Assault rifle.\n\nI equally believe however, and this may be going against the grain here (I haven't read many responses yet just a feeling) , that increasing mental health funding wouldn't help much in these extreme cases of violence. There are too many factors involved.. so you open an extra clinic or hire a few more staff but if this person wasn't getting the help they needed before the tragedy what makes you think with additional funding it would have made any significant difference?\n\nHe still would have needed someone in his life to give two shits and bring him to treatment, or be aware enough to see his issues. You can put all the safeguards in place but I don't see how you stop people from falling through the cracks when they are grown in an environment where they are not given proper care. There has been a movement from forced institutionalization to a more relaxed outpatient experience. 40 years ago some people who now live productivly would have been locked up for life so that is a good change, but it also has its downsides. Outreach does not exist and I am not sure how it should be administered. Do you go door to door asking people if anyone in the house is mentally ill and then lecture them? Do you take them away in handcuffs and force them to be commited? How can someone that is mentally ill be responsible for their own treatment when in many cases they aware they are suffering from a psychological illness? Parents also cannot be counted on as not all parents are created equal. I almost feel that having a child should have some sort of requirements in place. If you are irresponsible and neglectful you should not be allowed the responsibility of raising a child. We have higher requirements on choosing who can adopt a cat than we do on who can raise a human being.\n\nI do not have hard facts but going on feel again I assume the U.S. has a higher rate of these events per capita than any other developed nation. Something is obviously wrong. Yes that racist over in Norway commited horrible violence and i've read other spree killings happening but no where near the rate it happens in our country.\n\nFrom all the information I have read the conclusion I came up with to put any sort of rational to this type of self-repeating tragedy that is of a different nature here than anywhere else boils down to Culture. Countries are groups of individuals gathered together under a set of laws. The laws differ from country to country but people are all the same. Just as we enjoy entertainment, want to be loved, want offspring, want to feel productive so too does every other person in every other country. We all have the same human instincts. The difference is in how our culture is regulated.\n\nIn the U.S. we are in an environment where nonstop war is the norm. A private for profit prison system is acceptable. The U.S. Army creating their own first person shooting PC game and using it as a recruiting tool (Americas Army) is not even thought of as being somewhat odd... I remember in high school seeing a U.S. Army recruiting officer speaking to students in the guidance counselors office.\n\nViolent games such as Call of Duty become more and more realistic, more people play every new release and the advertising becomes more integrated in our psyche. I was born in 1986 and growing up when I was 12 I played the Pokemon Trading Card game with my friends. Now 12 year olds play Call of Duty online against strangers who control human characters on the screen and can talk to one another through microphones. I also grew up on Counter-Strike and I loved every minute of that game, but that was high school and I wasn't still forming my ideas of the world to the extent a younger child is. This is but one example I am not even talking about Movies or TV or magazines. There is so much overwhelming violent stimuli it is impossible for a child not to be exposed to it. Parental controls on your Xbox 360 are not a solution, it is a band-aid like every other solution the opportunist politicians have come up with. Our congressmen are too busy planning for or running their next election to represent our interests. Publicity and photo ops are more important than legislating and guiding our country away from this moral decay we are being suffocated by. I realize I sound like a right-wing nutjob but I am nothing of the sort. Labels are artifacts from the past, too many people are afraid of being labeled liberal or conservative that being rational and thinking of issues separate from one another is rarely done. The leaders who are supposed to guide us, be morally sound and set the course of our country have failed miserably. Holding elections does not select the best people for this vitally important task, it just selects the people best at winning the contest. We need people who have been tested in the real world and are proven to be of conviction, not a career politician or sleazy businessman/woman\n\nChildren are given G.I. Joe action figures and Lego sets and dream of being heroic killing machines. They dress in Halloween costumes of their favorite action movie star. Whatever happened to raising your child to being a scientist or a doctor? Perhaps the best thing to happen to Europe is the series of great wars fought on their own lands that allowed them to see violence is not sexy and is not acceptable. \n\nAmerica is in its own little bubble where everything is safe, if you feel like eating a big mac you talk to a machine and drive to a window where a hand pops out and gives you whatever you desire. We don't have the true experience of everyday warfare and struggling to survive. We experience these tragic events as we experienced 9/11 and then it cools off for enough time that we forget the past and it feels like an isolated incident, but it is all connected in a country full of moral backwardness and profit seeking exploitation. We have failed so heavily as a society that all of this seems normal and no one even questions the decision they make for their own children. We have systematically lost our way as a culture to the point that when events like this happen I am not even shocked anymore. I am shocked that it doesn't happen more often.\n\nEDIT: I have seen folks in other places talk about how this is the fault of our educational system, and that we should be teaching kids empathy and problem solving skills rather than just math/science/english. First of all empathy is not something that can be taught, it has to be experienced. Children are in school for at most 8 hours. They go home and receive an overload of all the above social trends I described. The home life and the school life both need to be reevaluated. We are failing our children and failing each other. Too timid to look outside the box and radically change our way of life. For the empathy part of the puzzle I would love to see children of all schools, public and private, be brought to homeless shelters, food kitchens and hospitals for a few hours a week and interact with people in less fortunate circumstances then themselves in a real world situation but of course that would be considered crazy and never happen\n\nAmerica is not a shining beacon of moral superiority and it never was, but it can be.

Even the crucifixion of Christ for Christians (and even for others to some degree) holds forth above all an act of violence in which force is linked with the physical act of torture and building, in the form of nails, hammering, presenting a tortured body for all to see. This establishes a reference point of what is to be taken as *non plus ultra*, rock solid Truth with a capital T. This in turn focuses minds and shapes people's epistemologies and justice logics. When linked especially with the subordination of thought that goes with most (if not all) religious commitment, this becomes a paradigmatic, ongoing reference point that secures this dominance of the \"bottom line truth\" of physical salience and dramatic effect. That is why, for example, one analyst on the radio (NPR) pointed out that we remain in far greater danger of dying from not being buckled up in a car than from a shooting like this one, yet this captures people's imaginations, just as 911 captured people's imaginations far more than the Sanctions on Iraq, even though the latter are thought to have killed around 500,000 children. Indeed, the drone warfare many bemoan today exemplifies this receding into the background of anything but the in-your-face approach that is fostered by dominant spirituality. \n\nOne would be remiss not to conjecture whether there is more involved in that spirituality, be it notable religions as such, or even just popular media, movies like Batman, etc. And in any case, these as well do bear the same episto-jurdical profile, as it might be called. The role of violence and \"drama\", \"action\", etc., in these media, coupled with the logics of retributive justice continue to be a perfect storm that occasionally lashes out in the lightning strike like this and other shootings. It seems little accident that the one shooter portrayed himself as \"the Joker\". \n\nBut to begin to grasp the relationship to \"mental health\" in light of these basic conditions is a bit more difficult. Internally, mental health is a branch of the same tree, to some extent, meaning that its truth, and various logics of help (*therapeia* or help and *therapon* or service), amelioration and basic understanding limp under the burden, indeed borne all to much like a kind of cross, of the said religious commitments whose epistemo-juridical commitments secure and dominate thought and ultimately spirit, soul, or the *psyche* of *psychiatry*. \n\nWhen an intensely religious man like Obama points in the direction of amelioration, he does so with an invisible stutter; he is shaken, not stirred, because he already knows his own religious commitments are partially to blame, yet he remains likewise blind to just how this is the case, and hasn't the slightest interest in calling that sort of thing into question. Mental health as such remains enslaved to the dominant culture, leading the way far less then it did in the earlier movements of change and \"progress\", such as the 60's. But those movements for change themselves already set in place precisely the dominance in question here, already brought the basic ontological profile of the preference for the salient and for physical violence as the great touchstone, already subordinated thought, already insinuated into the great Open its particular narratives of spirit and purpose. \n\nThe mental health that is to come must be a more broadly focused social health, in which thought, amelioration and nonviolence are truly independent, and this means a certain transcendence of the dominant spirituality. Yet what is most striking is that what will help to prevent these kinds of events from happening will lie not in addressing them so much as in shifting truth and understanding to the matter of essential violence, essential harm, essential cause, essential effect: that among these are the very conditions of dominant religion and spirituality. For these are the real roots of the problem, while the focus on the shootings itself is part of the problem. This is not a matter of strategic ignoring by any means. It is a matter of keeping a steadfast and resolutely free attunement to truth, amelioration, nonviolence and nonharm, against the pressures, gentle and otherwise, to conform these to the agendas of specific religious, spiritual and even psychiatric practice. \n\nTo be critical of dominant practice likewise runs the risk of appearing at times to affirm egregious acts: emphasizing that the sanctions were worse than 911, and actually contributed to it as per Osama Bin Laden's statement, appears to affirm Bin Laden. Emphasizing the role of dominant spirituality, its logics of revenge, justice and ontological priorities appears to speak for the actor in this current, horrendous tragedy or other shootings. Recognizing the problem of bullying would seem to somehow validate the Colombine shooters. *Only free thought that is competent can make the distinctions by which these tragedies can be understood without being thereby endorsed*. In analogy, only free thought can manage the conditions of a \"mental health\" that must return to the all but abdicated role and promise it has had for not simply cleaning up society's messes, but engaging in potent social criticism on the vanguard, with philosophical, spiritual and juridical purchase. \n\nAt the very minimum, what remains wanting in the current arrangement is above all a moment of reflection, which is at once a movement of transcendence, that is repellent to most people and the highly capitalized and capitalizing industries of moral invective powering virtually all media: for this it is necessary above all to stand in the face of the lynch pins of dominant culture, those *non plus ultras* that serve to rivet truth in unstoppable structures, to rivet our gazes and our minds to the dominant specters and heroes and their attendant dramas, wars and enterprises; to stand in the face of the dominance of 911 and say no war, to say no in the face of the tragedy of Colombine and yet say no to bullying; to say no in the face of this current tragedy and yet to seek to understand and, above all, humanize the shooter, as difficult as this is to do. When even he becomes human and not the \"evil\" Obama invariably affirms, the events and conditions leading up to his horrendous precipitation as \"the shooter\" can be ameliorated. And when the dominant sensibility works actively to prevent precisely this, it must in turn be indicted as helping to pull the trigger. That's the moment of reflection that is most unwelcome here.\n\nThe understanding of this causality in which the dominant sensibility actively works to prevent amelioration, most often by assuming it is the master of amelioration and the determination of \"evil\" is the anti-lynch-pin *par excellence*. This understanding is above all simply this: understanding. An act of understanding, which, it should come as no surprise, has little accepted weight in the dominance of a reality conditioned by limits such as torture, killings, hard physical data, etc. This understanding must not only think and understand, it must stand boldly forth to affirm the status of the emergent primacy of the dominance of precisely those regimes and sensibilities who basically have had their chance. They are become primary as causes preventing true amelioration, and as such they themselves are participatory in the violence in a primary, first order, front rank, 911 kind of way. They *are* the cause. Our failure to understand this *is* the cause. Our inability to grasp that such understanding itself *is* the cause. The revolution is the realization that this understanding is the revolution, that the crisis of this understanding is not seen as a crisis. \n\nThis is *the* problem of the day. It permeates virtually all of the major institutional problems, from the CJ system at all phases including arrest and confinement; wars and the failure to vaunt and promote nonviolence-based revolutionary practice; economic disparity and the failure to arrive above all at non-profit ways of living. \n\nCan you even clarify what this \"mere understanding\" is at this point? Can you grasp the meaning of emergent primacy in this context? Is that too hard to do? Perhaps you are more inclined to say, \"well, that may be true, but *too bad*!\" When you are ready to turn on that, you may begin to turn in the turnings of true revolutionary change. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "c7h08sz", "post_id": "14v69k", "comment": "Cuz if you's talkin' about healthcare, you's a socialist!

Also, if one experiences a deficiency in one form, the person may be more likely to employ the other. The result would be that people deficient in the ability to perceive the physical world will tend to employ explanations that employ social cognition (such as attributing minds to entities), and vice versa. Also, as people feel satisfied with a certain set of explanations as they live their life, this may result in a neglect of the other form of cognition, thus rendering it more impoverished through neglect (but not due to neural defect). One way to beging to test would be to test the reverse: are people with poor understanding of the social world more likely to be scientific or analytical beliefs, or have superstitious beliefs that do not perceive minded entities (not things such as ghosts, witches, and demons which are seen as having minds)?\n\nIf that hypothesis is correct, then the study is more correlational than suggesting a direct relationship between understanding the physical world and religious/paranormal beliefs (outside of instances where the neural architecture used in object cognition is defective itself). Instead, the poor object cognition is simply an effect of the primary cause, a frequently used social cognition.

A number of people who generally consider themselves somewhat fringe coming together in a mostly homogeneous group with shared interests and culture.  It\u2019s not really a surprise to me that a sense of community develops.\n\nHaving gone with friends to a few metal shows, it was cool to see how the vast majority of them were basically very friendly behind the aggressive affectations.  \u201dHey fuckhead! Have a beer!\u201d was pretty much the norm, where \u201cfuckhead\u201d was used as a friendly nickname that both parties found funny.  Very similar to my experience in public safety circles honestly.  There were hundreds of people at one show and it seemed as if they almost all knew or recognized each other.  The behavior in the mosh pit was very representative as well.  In the midst of an aggressive group dance, if someone fell down, there were always a dozen people who would immediately wade in and help them back up again.\n\nThere is a problem with substance abuse present, but I would argue that it is less of an issue in the metal scene than it is with other popular music communities.\n\nBeing a smaller genre it also avoids some of the issues that larger followings have.  For instance, rap was generally much more introspective and powerful when it was a fringe genre.  It was as it got big and and attracted corporate interest that those corporations started exerting pressure and shaping the scene through marketing.  All of a sudden the vast majority of rap became wrapped up in a gangster aesthetic extolling violence and other negative pursuits.   I generally don\u2019t listen to any rap more recent than the early 90s these days.  I occasionally hear something catchy when my kids are listening these days, but I\u2019m at an age where I just don\u2019t have the interest in music that I used to and do t have the time to dig through looking for stuff I like.\n\nAlso, I love listening to Hatebreed or Icepick when working out, and it always feels like it helps me power through that last rep."}, {"comment_id": "epu4xyj", "post_id": "bvjw1s", "comment": "Really?

However, to date, it is unclear as to whether women are primarily treated uncivilly by men (i.e., members of the socially dominant group/out-group) or other women (i.e., members of in-group) in organizations. In light of different theorizing surrounding gender and incivility, we examine whether women experience increased incivility from other women or men, and whether this effect is amplified for women who exhibit higher agency and less communion at work given that these traits and behaviors violate stereotypical gender norms. Across three complementary studies, results indicate that women report experiencing more incivility from other women than from men, with this effect being amplified for women who are more agentic at work.

Kupfer, Pelin Gul\n\nPersonality and Social Psychology Bulletin 2018\n\nDOI: https://doi.org/10.1177/0146167218781000\n\nLink: http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0146167218781000\n\nAbstract\n\nBenevolent sexism (BS) has detrimental effects on women, yet women prefer men with BS attitudes over those without. The predominant explanation for this paradox is that women respond to the superficially positive appearance of BS without being aware of its subtly harmful effects. We propose an alternative explanation drawn from evolutionary and sociocultural theories on mate preferences: Women find BS men attractive because BS attitudes and behaviors signal that a man is willing to invest. Five studies showed that women prefer men with BS attitudes (Studies 1a, 1b, and 3) and behaviors (Studies 2a and 2b), especially in mating contexts, because BS mates are perceived as willing to invest (protect, provide, and commit). Women preferred BS men despite also perceiving them as patronizing and undermining. These findings extend understanding of women\u2019s motives for endorsing BS and suggest that women prefer BS men despite having awareness of the harmful consequences.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "e24h8jw", "post_id": "8xo0wi", "comment": "Reading the last few paragraphs of the article gives the study a lot of perspective"}, {"comment_id": "e24leqy", "post_id": "8xo0wi", "comment": "I would like to know what are the other types of men and their ratios in society."}, {"comment_id": "e24ijqf", "post_id": "8xo0wi", "comment": "This is fascinating for me.

Within  social animal groups, communicative threats ( vocal displays of aggression)  are quite often used as a warning ( threat counter threat behaviour)  both in interspecies ( threats from other members in the group) and to warn predators. \n\nModern day Humans also exist within social groups ( culture)  with varying degrees of threat. Whilst it's comparably a low level process to calculate the threat of certain dangerous environmental hazards like crossing a busy road,  calculating a verbal threat from another human isn't so objective. Essentially there is no way a human can know for sure the actual intentions of another human aggressor whom is displaying communicative  threatening behaviour. Of course the level of psychological threat detection (thus level of physiological fear. Fight or flight)  will vary depending on the context ( social context).  A female will, on average, feel more actual fear if the aggressor has the capacity to do her serious bodily harm, if the verbal threat turns out to be a intention rather than a mere warning.  ( maybe if the female didn't behave according to the aggressors will).  \n\nThus,in some circumstances  the potential for violence can be a unknown in regards to abusive language. This is why on average, young  children are more weary of men. It's a evolutionary strategy ( in the past and sadly the present, a child ( a average infant behaviour across all cultures)  being weary of all unknown men means the child has better odds of not being abused by the minority of males that would, given the opportunity).  Likewise,  females will have a lower threshold for the perception of threats. \n\nEssentially there is no distinction ( as it can't be effectively quantified in the mind. I.e. Nobody is a mind reader)  between verbal threats ( the threat to act)  and actually acts of violence. \n\n\nAnd of course two potential fighting cocks are more likely to \"calculate\"  a low threat>fear level ( evolved psychological mechanism leading to physiological behaviour), because historically fighting ( and risking injury or death)  was worth the prize ( genes driving the animals behaviour)  .

They utilized a technique called meta-analysis to combine data from ten clinical studies that fulfilled specific, rigorous criteria. They found that a single intravenous infusion of ketamine, at doses akin to those used in other studies to treat major depression, led to a rapid decrease in suicidal ideations. Within a day, about 55% of individuals who received ketamine no longer had suicidal ideations compared to 20% who received placebo. This reduction in suicidal ideations lasted for at least 7 days.\n\n\nJournal Reference:\n\nWilkinson, S.T., Ballard, E.D., Bloch, M.H., Mathew, S.J., Murrough, J.W., Feder, A., Sos, P., Wang, G., Zarate, C.A.

The authors conducted a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis examining the effects of a single dose of ketamine on suicidal ideation.\n\n> Method:\n\n> Individual participant data were obtained from 10 of 11 identified comparison intervention studies that used either saline or midazolam as a control treatment. The analysis included only participants who had suicidal ideation at baseline (N=167). A one-stage, individual participant data, meta-analytic procedure was employed using a mixed-effects, multilevel, general linear model. The primary outcome measures were the suicide items from clinician-administered (the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] or the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HAM-D]) and self-report scales (the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology\u2013Self Report [QIDS-SR] or the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI]), obtained for up to 1 week after ketamine administration.\n\n> Results:\n\n> Ketamine rapidly (within 1 day) reduced suicidal ideation significantly on both the clinician-administered and self-report outcome measures. Effect sizes were moderate to large (Cohen\u2019s d=0.48\u20130.85) at all time points after dosing. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated that compared with control treatments, ketamine had significant benefits on the individual suicide items of the MADRS, the HAM-D, and the QIDS-SR but not the BDI. Ketamine\u2019s effect on suicidal ideation remained significant after adjusting for concurrent changes in severity of depressive symptoms.\n\n> Conclusions:\n\n> Ketamine rapidly reduced suicidal thoughts, within 1 day and for up to 1 week in depressed patients with suicidal ideation. Ketamine\u2019s effects on suicidal ideation were partially independent of its effects on mood, although subsequent trials in transdiagnostic samples are required to confirm that ketamine exerts a specific effect on suicidal ideation. Additional research on ketamine\u2019s long-term safety and its efficacy in reducing suicide risk is needed before clinical implementation."}, {"comment_id": "dw1pjqa", "post_id": "861an2", "comment": "I did a systematic review looking at the therapeutic effects of psilocybin and mescaline for an MSc project, recently and have seen more and more research popping up on ketamine too.\n\nAt what point would these types of drugs be legal for therapeutic usage?

I found when I am experiencing depression at higher intensities, there will be a dialogue in my mind between a \"You\" (who is me with all my flaws) and \"I\" (who is my calm, cool, and collected side), \"I\" acts as a parent to the \"You\". Ketamine helps me unite those \"you\" and \"I\" senses of selfs and appreciating how I am as a person. Good and bad are part of the person that is I, and good or bad are simply opinions that I can work with. Another great thing with Ketamine is that it helps me snap out of auto-pilot and realize I have control in my life. I am not simply floating through life, I am an active participant where I can choose what choices to make, as every second is a blank slate in which a choice is made. \n\nEven at low doses of Ketamine I find myself more present focused and end up keeping an eye out for the positives of life, which is really helpful. I can imagine at consistent doses changes my entire line of biased negative thinking... It's just a matter of figuring out how much and how often.

I find that an overwhelming majority of people believe trying to calm down is the best way to cope with pre-performance anxiety. However, across several studies involving karaoke singing, public speaking, and math performance, I investigate an alternative strategy: reappraising anxiety as excitement. Compared with those who attempt to calm down, individuals who reappraise their anxious arousal as excitement feel more excited and perform better. Individuals can reappraise anxiety as excitement using minimal strategies such as self-talk (e.g., saying \u201cI am excited\u201d out loud) or simple messages (e.g., \u201cget excited\u201d), which lead them to feel more excited, adopt an opportunity mind-set (as opposed to a threat mind-set), and improve their subsequent performance.

This study used machine-learning algorithms (Gaussian Naive Bayes) to identify such individuals (17 suicidal ideators versus 17 controls) with high (91%) accuracy, based on their altered functional magnetic resonance imaging neural signatures of death-related and life-related concepts. The most discriminating concepts were \u2018death\u2019, \u2018cruelty\u2019, \u2018trouble\u2019, \u2018carefree\u2019, \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018praise\u2019. A similar classification accurately (94%) discriminated nine suicidal ideators who had made a suicide attempt from eight who had not. Moreover, a major facet of the concept alterations was the evoked emotion, whose neural signature served as an alternative basis for accurate (85%) group classification. This study establishes a biological, neurocognitive basis for altered concept representations in participants with suicidal ideation, which enables highly accurate group membership classification."}, {"comment_id": "dp4hr48", "post_id": "79qczm", "comment": "machine learning finding patterns from data is the next big revolution for humanity.  we just have to make sure those advances benefit everyone, not just the few that control access to the tech."}, {"comment_id": "dp4q7el", "post_id": "79qczm", "comment": "**results**\n\nThe  main  neurosemantic  analyses  were  performed  on  two  groups  \nof  participants:  17  suicidal  ideators  and  17  healthy  controls.  The  \ngroups were balanced on sex ratio, age, and Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI IQ) (Table 1). The stimuli were 30 concepts  (as  shown  in  Table 2)  that  were  each  presented  for  3s,  and  \nwere related to either suicide, positive affect or negative affect. The \nbrain locations that contain the main components of the neural representations of the 30 concepts, identified by the presence of stable voxels (those whose responses to the set of stimuli were similar over \nmultiple  presentations),  are  shown  in  Fig. 1  (see  Methods).  Six  of the  concepts  and  five  of  the  brain  locations  (Fig. 2)  provided  the  most accurate discrimination between the two groups. Interpretable, clinically  meaningful  differences  existed  between the  individuals  in  the  suicidal  ideator  and control groups,  and within  the  suicidal  ideator  group,  there  were  differences  between the  attempters  and  the  non-attempters.  The  classification  procedures  identified  the  concepts  and  brain  locations  that were  most predictive of the group membership for these two sets of contrasts (that is, suicidal ideator versus control, and attempter ideator versus non-attempter ideator).\n>A Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) classifier trained on the data \nof 33 out of 34 participants predicted the group membership of the \nremaining participant with a high accuracy of 0.91 (\n**P< 0.000001**)\n\nThat's pretty accurate.

Most people, when they're looking for informational support, will just ask for advice. Everyone has an opinion on something and advice isn't hard to come by. Asking for informational support doesn't diminish the authenticity of whatever advice might be given, but the same isn't true for emotional support. If you have to explicitly ask for someone to empathize with you then are they being honest or just telling you what you want to hear?\n\nAdditionally most people have some solutions in mind on how to deal with a problem they're having, and if they're struggling to solve it then it could be because of some internal obstacle like low self-efficacy or something external like lack of money. If your first impulse is to give advice without really taking the time to listen to the specifics about someone's problem you also run the risk of giving useless advice, so the better gamble is to be empathetic either way.\n\nI think that it's better to give instrumental support over informational support anyway. It's easy to tell someone \"oh you just need to do x, y, and z\" but it's another thing to help someone actually do those things, by offering your time or resources or whatever. Sometimes I feel useless if all I'm offering is a listening ear but maybe it also helps people work out their own solution to a problem if they really talk through it with someone. And, in a maybe paradoxical way, offering advice as the first approach kinda turns the focus of the conversation from them and their personal experience to you and your personal experience, sort of making their problem a tiny bit about you.

Individuals who feel they are provided with less support from their partner than they desire (underprovision) generally experience less positive affect, more negative affect, and tend to be less satisfied in their relationships. However, research findings are mixed with regard to whether receiving more of a particular type of support from one's partner than one desires (overprovision) is associated with more favorable affect and higher relationship satisfaction. The purpose of the present study was to examine whether underprovision and overprovision of two theoretically important types of social support from spouses-emotional or informational support-were associated with more favorable affect and higher relationship satisfaction in a sample of newlywed couples. Participants were 114 newlywed couples. Data were analyzed using Actor-Partner Interdependence Moderation Models. Results suggested that receiving more emotional support was associated with more favorable affect and higher relationship satisfaction regardless of support preferences. Also, wives who received more informational support from their husbands had higher relationship satisfaction regardless of support preferences. In contrast to findings for relationship satisfaction, the association between informational support and affect were consistent with matching hypotheses. Husbands who experienced underprovision of informational support from their wives, experienced less favorable affect. In contrast, wives who experienced overprovision of informational support from their husbands experienced higher depressive symptoms. Implications for research, theory, and practice are discussed.

This paper aimed to investigate recent trends in mental ill health and health-related behaviours in two cohorts of UK adolescents in 2005 and 2015.\n\nMethods\n\nPrevalences in mental health (depressive symptoms, self-harm, anti-social behaviours, parent-reported difficulties) and health-related behaviours (substance use, weight, weight perception, sleep, sexual intercourse) were examined at age 14 in two UK birth cohorts; Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC, N\u2009=\u20095627, born 1991\u201392) and Millennium Cohort Study (MCS, N\u2009=\u200911 318, born 2000\u201302). Prevalences and trend estimates are presented unadjusted and using propensity score matching and entropy balancing to account for differences between samples.\n\nResults\n\nDepressive symptoms (9% to 14.8%) and self-harm (11.8% to 14.4%) were higher in 2015 compared with 2005. Parent-reported emotional difficulties, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer problems were higher in 2015 compared with 2005 (5.7\u20138.9% to 9.7\u201317.7%). Conversely, substance use (tried smoking, 9.2% to 2.9%; tried alcohol, 52.1% to 43.5%, cannabis, 4.6% to 3.9%), sexual activity (2% to 0.9%) and anti-social behaviours (6.2\u201340.1% to 1.6\u201327.7%) were less common or no different. Adolescents in 2015 were spending less time sleeping (<8\u2009h 5.7% to 11.5%), had higher body mass index (BMI) (obese, 3.8% to 7.3%) and a greater proportion perceived themselves as overweight (26.5% to 32.9%). The findings should be interpreted bearing in mind limitations in ability to adequately harmonize certain variables and account for differences in attrition rates and generalizability of the two cohorts.\n\nConclusions\n\nGiven health-related behaviours are often cited as risk factors for poor mental health, our findings suggest relationships between these factors might be more complex and dynamic in nature than currently understood. Substantial increases in mental health difficulties, BMI and poor sleep-related behaviours highlight an increasing public health challenge."}, {"comment_id": "ehkduj6", "post_id": "aw50bp", "comment": "The inevitability of cimate change and the related effects definitely have something to do with it"}, {"comment_id": "ehlcqk9", "post_id": "aw50bp", "comment": "Are these studies adjusted for people who were depressed in the past but didn't get diagnosed?"}, {"comment_id": "ehlds2d", "post_id": "aw50bp", "comment": "I mean.

Here they mix the concepts of Social Dominance Orientation and preference for free market policies. The implicit reasoning of many researchers is that conservatives have a preference for inequality, and that preference for markets must be somehow related to that. But so far, the literature, they say, is not clear on whether high intelligence is correlated with preference for markets (though it seems so), and not clearly correlated with SDO\n\nAlso, this criticism seems pretty spot on, even if they were discussing cognitive intelligence with regards to conservatism rather than emotional intelligence with regards to \"right-wing views\":\n\n>So being an authoritarian, dogmatic, xenophobe, racist, sexist, prejudiced and closedminded person is related to lower intelligence. Shocking. If conservatism were that, then they have truly found that conservatism is dumb. Whatever the definition of conservative, the fact remains that many people calling themselves conservatives also share the above traits. Interestingly, those are also shared by what would be called populists (those who hold socially conservative and economically progressive views).\n\n>I want to stress here again the importance of choosing well what you measure. We know that economic and social attitudes are different concepts. The naive view of using real world political ideologies (and not philosophical, refined ideologies) seemingly has lead the field of psychology to create categories that aren't as much helpful (meaning that they don't have micro-psychological foundations) as they should to discern reality, but there are exceptions. See Malka & Soto 2014, and Malka & Soto 2015. In the first one, they document that high need for security and certainty predicts both economic leftism (welfare provision, government intervention in the economy) and social conservatism (as already described), and in the second one they propose a model to explain why actually existing political parties are not aligned this way, arguing that high political engagement leads one to match the socially accepted ideological blocks. The model is incomplete: Why the parties are like that, in the first place? But it is a good start.\n\nhttps://nintil.com/are-conservatives-less-intelligent/"}, {"comment_id": "eyz53l8", "post_id": "cziqg0", "comment": "Conservatives also have a lower IQ compared to their liberal counterparts.

No study has, however, investigated if emotional abilities also show such a relationship, although this can be expected based on both classic and recent literature. The aim of the present study was 2-fold: (a) to investigate the relationship between emotional abilities and right-wing and prejudiced attitudes, and (b) to pit the effects of emotional and cognitive abilities on these attitudes against each other. Results from 2 adult samples (n = 409 and 574) in which abilities scores were collected in individual testing sessions, revealed that emotional abilities are significantly and negatively related to social-cultural and economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes, as well as to blatant ethnic prejudice. These relationships were as strong as those found for cognitive abilities. For economic-hierarchical right-wing attitudes, emotional abilities were even the only significant correlate.

Using border/boundary theory (as reported by Ashforth, Kreiner, & Fugate (Academy of Management Review 25(3):472\u2013491, 2000) and Clark (Human Relations 54(6):747\u2013770, 2000)) and the effort-recovery model (as reported by Meijman & Mulder (Handbook of work and organizational psychology vol. 2 55\u201353, 1998)), we developed a research model that links work-to-life integration enactment to exhaustion and impaired work-life balance via lack of recovery activities (as reported by Sonnentag, Journal of Applied Psychology 88(3):518\u2013528, 2003). The model was tested using structural equation modeling. Our sample consisted of N = 1916 employees who were recruited via an online panel service. Results showed that employees who scored high on work-to-life integration enactment reported less recovery activities and in turn were more exhausted and experienced less work-life balance. Our study contributes to the existing literature on boundary management by investigating the well-being implications of work-to-life boundary enactment and by suggesting and testing recovery as an underlying mechanism. In doing so, we link boundary enactment with existing theory of the work-life interface. Based on our review of existent research on boundary management and well-being, we disentangle previous contradictory findings. Understanding of the well-being implications of boundary enactment and underlying mechanisms can help human resource professionals and practitioners to devise and implement organizational policies and interventions that enable employees to develop boundary management strategies that are sustainable in that they do not impair employees\u2019 well-being."}, {"comment_id": "dr6t44e", "post_id": "7jimkv", "comment": "This explains why most of my mechanic friends never work on their own cars.

The author discusses various ways in which stress overwhelms kids and TM seems to help, but all of that can be summarized by the finding in this non-controlled pilot study:\n\n[After one month, 87% [of the TMers] had a clinically significant decrease of more than 10 points. The reduction was so great that 37 participants (80%) had their symptoms reduced to below the clinical level, meaning that they were no longer considered to have a disorder.](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-01/muom-vwl011018.php)\n\nDepending on the overall health of the test subjects, RCT studies on TM and PTSD often show similar effects.\n\nHowever, one need not wait for the results of a pilot study to see a \"reduction to non-symptomatic\" in 80-90% of test-subjects...\n\nThe David Lynch Foundation has been teaching TM for free to \"at risk\" students in many different countries. The DLF goes in and teaches the students of an entire school, or of an entire school district or even of an entire state to meditate, while inviting the relevant governments to monitor the results.\n\nAlmost invariably, the reports are \"glowing,\" and commensurate with what you would expect if 80-90% of kids suffering from PTSD or the chronic-stress equivalent became non-symptomatic within a month or three of TM practice.\n\nWhen national governments (not to mention the largest religious sect in the world \u2014 the Roman Catholic Church) can see such results appearing in child after child, in school after school, in hundreds of thousands of children in many, many different countries, governments (and religions) take action.\n\nAfter evaluating the results in 44 schools that the DLF had taught TM to, the State of Oaxaca, Mexico now mandates that TM be taught to all public school children and that \"Yogic Flying\" \u2014 the traditional levitation practice of Yoga \u2014 be a mandatory subject in all public high schools.\n\nLikewise, [after evaluating the ongoing programs of this priest (see nomination webpages for a description of his work),](http://worldschildrensprize.org/gabrielmontoya) the Roman Catholic Church now recognizes TM and TM's \"levitation\" practice as legitimate therapies for PTSD and other stress-related issues in children, with TM and even levitation now being taught in Church-run schools and orphanages throughout South America.\n\n The largest project is in Ecuador, where the government has contracted to have 2,000 public school teachers trained as TM teachers, who will then teach TM to 2 million public school kids.\n\n\n.\n\nPoverty can have an overwhelmingly detrimental effect on children. TM can have an overwhelmingly positive effect on children in poverty.\n\nRegardless of the current circumstances of a child, TM can help bring about what is traditionally called \"enlightenment.\"\n\nThe beginning stage is defined physiologically as where the physical trait in the brain that emerges during TM practice \u2014 a more quiet form of mind-wandering rest \u2014 starts to become the \"new normal\" outside of meditation. Since it is during mind-wandering that our sense-of-self emerges, a quieter mode of mind-wandering rest is appreciated as a quieter sense-of-self \u2014 *I am* rather than \"I am *doing*.\"\n\nAs part of the studies on enlightenment via TM, researchers found 17 subjects (average meditation, etc experience 16,000 hours) who were reporting at least having a  pure sense-of-self continuously for at least a year, and asked them to \"describe yourself\" ([see table 3 of psychological correlates study](http://www.totalbrain.ch/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/eeg-of-enlightenment.pdf)), and these were some of the responses:\n\n\n* _We ordinarily think my self as this age; this color of hair; these hobbies . . . my experience is that my Self is a lot larger than that. It's immeasurably vast. . . on a physical level. It is not just restricted to this physical environment_\n\n* _It's the \u2018\u2018I am-ness.\u2019\u2019 It's my Being. There's just a channel underneath that's just underlying everything. It's my essence there and it just doesn't stop where I stop. . . by \u2018\u2018I,\u2019\u2019 I mean this 5 ft. 2 person that moves around here and there_\n\n* _I look out and see this beautiful divine Intelligence. . . you could say in the sky, in the tree, but really being expressed through these things. . . and these are my Self_\n\n\n* _I experience myself as being without edges or content. . . beyond the universe. . . all-pervading, and being absolutely thrilled, absolutely delighted with every motion that my body makes. With everything that my eyes see, my ears hear, my nose smells. There's a delight in the sense that I am able to penetrate that. My consciousness, my intelligence pervades everything I see, feel and think_\n\n* _When I say \u2019\u2019I\u2019\u2019 that's the Self. There's a quality that is so pervasive about the Self that I'm quite sure that the \u2018\u2018I\u2019\u2019 is the same \u2018\u2018I\u2019\u2019 as everyone else's \u2018\u2018I.\u2019\u2019 Not in terms of what follows right after.

Among actor effects, those for conscientiousness, agreeableness, extraversion, and neuroticism were the most robust predictors of well-being. Among partner effects, conscientiousness and neuroticism were the most robust predictors of well-being. Consistent with past research, similarity effects on well-being were generally small and not always significant. The results are discussed in the context of experiential conceptualizations of well-being and operationalizing similarity in relationship research.\n"}, {"comment_id": "egcaau8", "post_id": "aps7dy", "comment": "This really resonates with me, as a 34 year old single man with a long dating history.

I wanted someone who liked the same music, enjoyed the same movies, had the same hobbies. I *needed* someone of similar intelligence, of similar passions and comparable ideals. I found a few that came close, but things never worked. \n\nThen I met my most recent ex. She was absolutely none of those things. She loves Mariah Carey and Filipino singing shows. She's a sucker for Disney/Pixar. She doesn't really have any hobbies besides cooking and eating. She's a doctor but she isn't the type of intelligent that impresses you immediately. She's very humble and quiet. \n\nBut more so than anything else, she was kind. She was incredibly, wonderfully kind. She has a giant heart and would do anything for those she loves. She's incredibly close with her family. She prayed for me even after we broke up, when I deserved the exact opposite of prayer. She cried when we broke up because she felt so bad about hurting me although again, I deserved it. \n\nNow I realize that above all else, I'm looking for someone who is kind like her.

I hope he fucking ended up in a car fire that melted his fucking mouth shut and has kept him in constant pain.

The paper this comes from is from 2016 - reference below. I actually suggested this paper to the prof organizing a course in \"critical analysis\", during the 3rd year of my psych degree, and we did it. There's a whole host of issues that I put forward, and the entire year group generally came up with the same points. I've pasted them below, it's a really messy format, but you get the idea. \n\n* The participants in Experiment 1 are heavily male biased. The authors do state that gender did not moderate any observed effects, and so emitted this data. However I think, with gender being so heavily weighted, it would be interesting to actually see this data. Obviously replication with a more balanced pool would be ideal (and necessary to convince me). \n* I am not convinced at all by their measure of the vague concept of \"class\". They cite a paper from 1983 as support for their method. It's one question. Essentially \"what class are you\". I'm not convinced by this at all, especially in the US where the concept of  the \"middle class\" has been slowly eroding. It's very subjective, and the lowest class option is simply \"poor\". I don't think this is a substantial measure, especially since SES is so absolutely central to the entire paper and all of the results. \n* In order to determine the gaze of participants in the first experiment, the experimenters recorded POV video using Google Glass. Now, I know this is subjective, but the first thing I would do in this situation is look around in awe at the novelty of the technology I am getting to use. Could this novelty influence participant gaze or behavior? Might the participants guess their POV is being recorded, and might this produce the Hawthorne effect? \n* In experiment 3, the experimenters make use of the Amazon Turk (AT) website. I was interested in this from the previous paper we discussed with utilized AT. What kind of people use AT? Are they genuinely doing it for the cash reward ($0.51 in this case; not a sum that anyone particularly well-off would tend to gravitate towards (I'm aware I'm generalizing here)), or because they have so much free time to do such activities (possibly suggesting they are better off, or unemployed etc.)? Might the \"workers\" power through multiple tests at a time, in one sitting, to maximize the monetary reward? Could this seriously effect the amount of care and attention they provide? In short, I'm very interested in the whole idea of using AT as a pool of psychological participants. If you can direct me to anything at all relating to this I'd be glad!  \n* Could the area of the city the participants were selected in for experiment 1 influence the results? The city itself? The country/culture? As we know, people are drawn to novelty. It's entirely possible that the people who partook in the experiment where not regular visitors to the area, and so the surroundings themselves were novel and warranted more attention than the people in the street. I'm sure it would be a small effect, but it's interesting to consider. Could someone dressed in business attire in a poor district warrant more attention than the majority of other people in the street, or vice versa? \n* Personality traits could also play a part. Just from the top of my head, and with no proof, I would say that those who are introverted would tend to be more likely to want to avoid making eye contact in the street, and therefore avert their gaze, however extroverts may walk and actively attempt to make eye contact. Could openness play a part in the attention payed to people in the street? Neuroticism?\n\nDietze, P., & Knowles, E. D. (2016).

On back day you open with dead lifts, etc.  Then the dread is gone and the rest of the workout is enjoyable from that point forward.  Many people who save the worst for last end up skipping it all together.\n2. Going to gym keeps my diet in check because you don't want to waste the time you spent going there.  The general feeling of light soreness is also a daily reminder to keep your diet on track.  For everyone saying they struggle with diet, but rarely workout, it's a **lot** easier if your living a very active lifestyle to encourage your diet, don't expect to eat perfect while sitting in front of a computer 8 hours a day and not doing any lifting or cardio all week..\n3.

Don't bother making a meat head joke, you can bet your ass that you're viewing someone who's mentally strong and diligent with their goals.  And if you're an employer, and one applicant is wildly obese and the other clearly is on point with their health and fitness, it's kind of obvious who they're going to bias towards because they'll be thinking if they're willing to work hard on that, they'll be willing to work hard in other aspects of their life too.

In recent years, key computational models have conceptualized habits as arising from model-free reinforcement learning mechanisms, which typically select between available actions based on the future value expected to result from each. Traditionally, however, habits have been understood as behaviors that can be triggered directly by a stimulus, without requiring the animal to evaluate expected outcomes. Here, we develop a computational model instantiating this traditional view, in which habits develop through the direct strengthening of recently taken actions rather than through the encoding of outcomes. We demonstrate that this model accounts for key behavioral manifestations of habits, including insensitivity to outcome devaluation and contingency degradation, as well as the effects of reinforcement schedule on the rate of habit formation. The model also explains the prevalent observation of perseveration in repeated-choice tasks as an additional behavioral manifestation of the habit system. We suggest that mapping habitual behaviors onto value-free mechanisms provides a parsimonious account of existing behavioral and neural data. This mapping may provide a new foundation for building robust and comprehensive models of the interaction of habits with other, more goal-directed types of behaviors and help to better guide research into the neural mechanisms underlying control of instrumental behavior more generally.

Child resemblance and paternal investment**\n\n> Evolutionary theory predicts parents will provide preferential\ncare to genetically related children to advance their genetic\nsuccess (Hamilton, 1963; Trivers, 1972; Alexander, 1974). Investments\nin unrelated children are deemed wasteful since they reduce\ninvestment in genetically related offspring. Indeed, stepchildren\nand adoptees tend to receive less parental investment and greater\nmistreatment (e.g. Bertram (1975) for evidence on lions; Daly\nand Wilson (1996), Case and Paxson (2001), and Gibson (2009)\nfor evidence on humans). Similar differential treatment prevails\nwhen males suspect infidelity. Evidence based on both animals and\nhumans indicate that males invest in parental care in response to\npaternity certainty (birds: Moller and Birkhead (1993); fish: Neff\nand Gross (2001);nonhumanprimates:Buchanet al.(2003), Langos\net al.(2013);humans: Fox and Bruce (2001),Andersonet al.(2007)).\nDoubtful males can use a child\u2019s resemblance as a cue of genetic\nrelatedness (Alexander, 1974; Daly and Wilson, 1998; Volk and\nQuinsey, 2002)2 in lieu of relatively costly paternity testing.3 This is\npossible because parent\u2013child resemblance is sufficiently present\nin children for it to be detected from as early as birth (Porter et al.,\n1984; McLain et al., 2000; Alvergne et al., 2007; Kaminski et al.,\n2010). Experiment-based evidence of paternal involvement corroborates\nthis. For example, based on video images of children ages\n4\u201372 months, Volk and Quinsey (2002, 2007) find a man is more\nprone than a woman to adopt a child looking like him. Similarly,\nbased on pictures morphed with at least 25% of respondent\u2019s facial\ntraits, Platek et al. (2002, 2003, 2004) find men (but not women)\nhypothetically spendmore time, adopt, or providefinancial support\nto toddlers similar to themselves. Moreover, according to Platek\net al. (2004, 2005), neurocognitive processes drive these gender\ndifferences. Studies on actual biological parents also support that\nmen use resemblance as a paternity cue (e.g. Apicella and Marlowe,\n2004; Alvergne et al., 2009). Even fathers convicted of family violence\ntreat children better based on similar facial likeness (Burch\nand Gallup, 2000). Finally, with respectto the reliability of reported\nresemblance, Alvergne et al. (2010) present three key findings on\nchildren as young as 3 months. First, resemblance is consistent\nwhen reported in private by each parent. Second, both parents are\nmore likely to report father\u2013child similarity when the child actually\nresembles the father (as determined by external judges). Third,\nactual facial likeness predicts paternal investment.\nTo conclude, many evolutionary sociobiology studies support\nusing father\u2013child resemblance to explain a putative father\u2019s\ninvestment. Because women do not need facial resemblance cues\nto decide whether to provide care, we expect baby looks affect child\ndevelopmental outcomes only through a father\u2019s investments.4 As\nwe indicated above, when data are collected in private and separately\nfrom each parent, reported resemblance is reliable and\nmatches actual resemblance."}, {"comment_id": "dvbkyiv", "post_id": "82nqyp", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dvczv1d", "post_id": "82nqyp", "comment": "I look nothing like my Father.

Accepted Author Manuscript. \n\nLink: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jcpy.1137\n\ndoi:10.1002/jcpy.1137\n\nAbstract\n\nPrior consumer research has studied the impact of anthropomorphism on product perception and evaluation. This research explores how anthropomorphic thinking influences people's experience of emotions and subsequent consumption behavior. Based on research on emotion regulation and the psychological process of detachment, we show that individuals instructed to anthropomorphize sadness (i.e., think of sadness as a person) report less experienced sadness afterward (Studies 1 and 2A). The same result is observed for its opposite, happiness, such that anthropomorphic thinking dilutes happiness (Study 2B). We argue that this reduction of emotion occurs because anthropomorphic thinking increases the perceived distance between the self and the anthropomorphized emotion, thereby creating a feeling of detachment. Evidence for a detachment process is found via measurement (Studies 3 and 4) and a theory\u2010guided moderation, with the effect lessening when sadness is seen as a dependent (vs. independent) person (Study 3). These findings have implications for consumer behavior. When sadness is ameliorated by anthropomorphic thinking, people tend to display better self\u2010control in subsequent consumption, as manifested by a greater likelihood of choosing a healthier or more practical product (Studies 4 and 5)."}, {"comment_id": "f2uzbwi", "post_id": "degk1w", "comment": "Layman here, gotta be honest that sounds kinda unhealthy to disassociate your emotions like that.

I am beginning to see a pattern that emerges throughout science, arts, and religion: and that is symbolic conceptualization. Whether mathematically, abstractly, or illustratively, people have always tried to understand what feelings \"are\", and the various schools of thought look at various parts, like the blind men examining the elephant once did. The sooner we stop contrasting long enough to start comparing will be where the bigger picture is revealed. I've been reading old books on philosophy and religion and it's interesting to note that serious scholars would casually mention things having a saturine quality or mercurian disposition, for example. Thinking about how modern day scholars foo foo these out dated astrology ideas, we miss important threads of continuity. In the future, people may just as well foo foo our modern day expressions and conceptualizations as much as we do today, while continuing the trend... \n\nThe main issue I had with the illustration of \"Inside Out\" watching with the understanding that it was significant to our cultures' accepted conceptualization of feelings, is that it \"giving life\" to the emotion sadness, while good to distinguish from other emotions, such as joy, such not necessarily put them at odds with one another, as in reality, there are a careful mix of multiple feelings and emotions that contribute to a greater, deeper understanding, which I do think they tied in with the idea of the initial struggle, and then mixing of the marbles in the end, symbolic of growth and maturity. While there was a lot of neat ideas, it's nothing new, and furthermore, over simplified. \n\nPart of the human need is for others, and this study is a great example of why; one needs to be able to see themselves \"outside\" their own emotions, and be able to recognize that in others, to then not feel so alone or plagued by such burden of emotion. Perhaps it wasn't that they imagined what \"sad\" is anthropomorphized that was the specific key, because recognizing \"sad\" in another person other than oneself could have the same effect, and wider applications, do doubt (empathy). I think the real difference is that the people who felt more burdened is because they were thinking about themselves, and therefore tend to be self serving, even up against serving their best interests. If there's nothing or nobody to measure or compare and contrast with, then it's more difficult to see a bigger picture outside one's immediate wants, which can include feeling sad because they feel it. \n\nBeing able to then archetype an emotion is to then be able to choose to detach from selecting a quality that one would not want in the long term, even if they long for it in the present. So to archetype Sadness as \"blue\" is arguably more simple but consistent than saying Sadness is from Saturn. Yet, we are all attempting to express our place and understand our existence in some way, shape, form, or archetype. So red is mars, which widely considered angry. How much more detached can a feeling be than from a different planet? At the same time, I don't necessarily agree that something that would be \"good\" for one emotion, but not another, and \"detachment\" is not generally a \"good\" concept. Again, looking at the classic astrological interpretations of the various houses and planets,  we can begin to see perhaps other purposes than \"horoscopes\" this system may have been developed trying to archetype various dispositions and what they would \"look\" like. So a person could be said of having a Solary disposition if they were, like the Sun, a center of importance, like The Sun King, for example. The complexity of astrological conceptualizations of emotional dispositions allows room for the \"yin and yang\" or \"good and bad\" found within every \"positive\" emotion as well as every negative one. So, if someone is always green with envy like the earth, we tend to visualize some kind of feminine creature, none the less, maybe too preoccupied with the best and most beautiful in life, which in turn, is perhaps is a fair disposition to sometimes take on as  beautiful creature themselves... so rather than feeling a bad feeling and simply detaching from it, we can then perhaps begin to feel \"more\" than the simple feeling, and in turn understand what type of disposition that feeling typically aligns with.  To recognize feeling sad, or enduring some kind of hardship as \"Saturnine qualities\" rather than the modern expression of \"being blue\" is that it is more 3D and dynamic rather than a fixed 2D state of being. Being sad is an important expression NOT to detach from; in times of hardship, one may feel sadness, which signals that there may be harder days to come. One can move from a Saturnine quality to one of Mars, Venus, Mercury, Sun, etc. depending on how they respond to that sadness and situation. If someone killed their loved one, causing sadness and hardship, if they stay in that state, they will endure more sadness and hardship. If they are moved to anger and seek revenge, suddenly they are of a Mars disposition with all there is to endure and learn in that state of disposition, until they move to another, and so on. A glorious justice might move them to a Solary disposition, a poetic justice into a Mercurial disposition, and so on and so forth. The difference in philosophy is that one will not move to a different disposition until they understand the present one more fully, the good and the bad, the easy and the hardship within the experience. To detach from a feeling will not change one's disposition surrounding that particular feeling, it will only effectively prolong one's time enduring a particular and specific set of emotions instead of moving on to a new set of emotions and all the glories and adversities that come with it."}, {"comment_id": "f2x6pas", "post_id": "degk1w", "comment": "NLP only found out about this 40 years ago!

In this investigation, we deepen our understanding of trustworthiness. Across six studies using economic games that measure trustworthy behavior and survey items that measure trustworthy intentions, we explore the personality traits that predict trustworthiness. We demonstrate that guilt-proneness predicts trustworthiness better than a variety of other personality measures, and we identify sense of interpersonal responsibility as the underlying mechanism by both measuring it and manipulating it directly. People who are high in guilt-proneness are more likely to be trustworthy than are individuals who are low in guilt-proneness, but they are not universally more generous. We demonstrate that people high in guilt-proneness are more likely to behave in interpersonally sensitive ways when they are more responsible for others\u2019 outcomes. We also explore potential interventions to increase trustworthiness. Our findings fill a significant gap in the trust literature by building a foundation for investigating trustworthiness, by identifying a trait predictor of trustworthy intentions and behavior, and by providing practical advice for deciding in whom we should place our trust. \n\n\n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "e2u7mqc", "post_id": "90x1df", "comment": "When the punishment for behaving like a shithead is internal, there's no avoiding it.

Following this possibility, a systematic exploration of the effects of \u201cmicrodoses,\u201d comprising hundreds of lengthy descriptive reports, was undertaken. Based on these reports, using a psychedelic in the microdose range (10 micrograms) every three days was determined to be safe across a wide variety of individuals and conditions. Over 18 months, more than a thousand individuals from 59 countries did a daily evaluation of negative and positive emotional state using the PANAS checklist plus written reports for between one week and four months. Participant reports suggested that spaced but repeated microdoses were followed by improvements in negative moods, especially depression, and increases in positive moods. Increased energy, improved work effectiveness, and improved health habits were observed in clinical and non-clinical populations. Smaller samples described alleviation of symptoms in migraine headaches, pre-menstrual syndromes, traumatic brain injury, shingles, and other conditions not previously associated with psychedelic use."}, {"comment_id": "ek3opd2", "post_id": "b9bw86", "comment": "I wonder if it's possible to do this without volunteers who knows what they are taking.

Despite its widespread use and significant evidence to support its effectiveness in decreasing problem behavior, time-out is often suggested to be harmful or ineffective by the popular media and select professional organizations. Empirical evidence regarding possible side effects of time-out is limited. The present study examined the relationship between reported use of time-out and child emotional and behavioral functioning and parent-child relationships using longitudinal, archival data.\n\nMethods: The study used archival, longitudinal data from the Early Head Start Research and Evaluation study. This study tracked families with children in Early Head Start at 3 different time points as follows: baseline (aged 0\u20133 years), pre-kindergarten, and fifth grade. Parent interviews, including questions on the use of time-out, were conducted when the children were 36 months old. Indicators of child emotional and behavioral health were measured at 36 months, pre-K, and fifth grade. Statistical analyses were completed to assess for potential side effects of time-out on child behavioral and emotional functioning and parent-child relationships.\n\nResults: Analyses for all outcome variables suggest no significant difference for children whose parents reported using time-out versus those who did not.\n\nConclusion: Parental reported use of time-out was not associated with long-term negative outcomes. Further research in this area is necessary to continue to address the multitude of concerns related to time-out that are presented by the media."}, {"comment_id": "f08xtkj", "post_id": "d44x1r", "comment": "Criminologist here.

Study 2 probed more deeply into how parents display failure mind-sets. In Study 3a, we found that children can indeed accurately perceive their parents\u2019 failure mind-sets but not their parents\u2019 intelligence mind-sets. Study 3b showed that children\u2019s perceptions of their parents\u2019 failure mind-sets also predicted their own intelligence mind-sets.

Attenuated cardiovascular reactivity is one physiological mechanism implicated in explaining these effects. Drawing on attachment and social baseline theories, this experimental study evaluated two potential affiliative cues as mechanisms through which romantic relationships may attenuate cardiovascular reactivity to a laboratory\u2010based stressor. Prior to a cold pressor task, 102 participants were randomly assigned to either have their partner physically present, call upon a mental representation of their partner, or think about their day during the stressor. Consistent with our preregistered hypotheses, participants in both the partner present and mental activation conditions had significantly lower blood pressure (BP) reactivity during the cold pressor task compared to control participants for both systolic (d = \u22120.54) and diastolic BP (d = \u22120.53), but no significant differences emerged for heart rate or heart rate variability. Although participants in the partner present and mental activation conditions had similar BP reactivity to the cold pressor task, those in the partner present condition reported significantly less pain as a result of the task. The difference in BP reactivity by condition was moderated\u2014BP reactivity was greater for people with lower self\u2010reported relationship satisfaction. The results suggest that accessing the mental representation of a romantic partner and a partner's presence each buffer against exaggerated acute stress responses to a similar degree."}, {"comment_id": "eeu8vth", "post_id": "ajbd2l", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eevg6cq", "post_id": "ajbd2l", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eewdau2", "post_id": "ajbd2l", "comment": "For those of us not in relationships because we have a knack for tanking them (like I did last night)?

Study 2 employed a two-part acts nomination design to enumerate \u201cbeing yourself\u201d while dating and to examine personality correlates of \u201cbeing yourself\u201d. Study 3 explored whether individuals being themselves are attractive and if being yourself results in assortative mating with authentic individuals. Study 4 determined the effect of \u201cbe yourself\u201d mindset priming on \u201cbe yourself\u201d dating behavior. Study 1 found that authenticity is associated with emotional intelligence and positive relational outcomes. Study 2 found that \u201cbeing yourself\u201d dating behavior is associated with authenticity, secure attachment, and low narcissism. Study 3 found that \u201cbe yourself\u201d dating behavior is attractive and facilitates assortative mating with authentic individuals. Study 4 found that rejection sensitive individuals are more likely to engage in \u201cbe yourself\u201d dating behavior when made to feel safe to be themselves. \u201cBe yourself\u201d is the dating strategy that authentic individuals use to facilitate successful long-term relationships."}, {"comment_id": "ehp5k90", "post_id": "awsuoj", "comment": "It seems I can't access the studies themselves but I'd be very interested in seeing what scales and measurements are used to quantify authenticity.

And, if an adult plays hard to get, he may feel it's about what he naturally feels he should do, but that is also not authentic as there's no awareness of why it is happening. In both of these cases, it's about having power because of fear - one more visceral and the other more complex.\n\nIt's important to know that the authentic self and damaged self aren't the same thing.

In addition, they were higher for Factor 1 (i.e., interpersonal/affective) as opposed to Factor 2 (i.e., impulsive, antisocial) psychopathy traits. Participants with marked PD features, including Factor 2 psychopathy traits, were more inclined than others to endorse a preference for psychopathic males.\n\nConclusions\n\nRelative attraction to psychopathic males and observed homophily may be avenues through which psychopathic traits persist in the population across time.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "e8lgwzh", "post_id": "9s2337", "comment": "That does kind of make sense.

Drawing on a collection of findings suggesting that different social class contexts have powerful effects on people\u2019s sense of self, we propose that social class shapes the beliefs that people hold about their abilities, and that this, in turn, has important implications for how status hierarchies perpetuate. We first hypothesize that compared with individuals with relatively low social class, individuals with relatively high social class are more overconfident. Then, drawing on research suggesting that overconfidence can confer social advantages, we further hypothesize that the overcon- fidence of higher class individuals can help perpetuate the existing class hierarchy: It can provide them a path to social advantage by making them appear more competent in the eyes of others. We test these ideas in four large studies with a combined sample of 152,661 individuals. Study 1, a large field study featuring small-business owners from Mexico, found evidence that individuals with relatively high social class are more overconfident compared with their lower-class counterparts. Study 2, a multiwave study in the United States, replicated this result and further shed light on the underlying mechanism: Individuals with relatively high (vs. low) social class tend to be more overconfident because they have a stronger desire to achieve high social rank. Study 3 replicated these findings in a high-powered, preregistered study and found that individuals with relatively high social class were more overconfident, even in a task in which they had no performance advantages. Study 4, a multiphase study that featured a mock job interview in the laboratory, found that compared with their lower-class counterparts, higher-class individuals were more overconfident; overconfidence, in turn, made them appear more competent and more likely to attain social rank."}, {"comment_id": "eo8kt7u", "post_id": "bqveyg", "comment": "I go to an upper middle class/upper class high school and I\u2019ve always thought the reason the kids with loaded parents were so relaxed since they had such a huge financial cushion.

After the first 15 minutes of a 30-min meditation or control exercise, meditation-trained participants judged interval durations of 15 to 50 s or 2 to 6 min, during which they performed either a mindfulness meditation exercise or a control exercise. The participants\u2019 scores on the self-reported scales indicated the effectiveness of the meditation exercise, as it increased the level of present-moment awareness and happiness and decreased that of anxiety. The results showed an underestimation of time for the short interval durations and an overestimation of time for the long intervals, although the participants always reported that time passed faster with meditation than with the control exercise. Further statistical analyses revealed that the focus on the present-moment significantly mediated the exercise effect on the time estimates for long durations. The inversion in time estimates between the two time scales is explained in terms of the different mechanisms underlying the judgment of short and long durations, i.e., the cognitive mechanisms of attention and memory, respectively."}, {"comment_id": "f5xcgj2", "post_id": "dpntev", "comment": "When you meditate, you're focusing for an extended period on a single point.\n\nThis the part of meditation that likely helps with perception of time.

For vision, it allows people to intuitively see depth without \"thinking about it\".  It takes in two flat images from each eye, does the math, and positions objects in 3 dimensional space on the graph paper in your mind.\n\nThe visual cortex does the same with time.  It lays out your day as a timeline on graph paper and gives people an \"intuitive\" understanding of time.\n\nDeficiencies in the visual cortex are linked with ADHD, a time processing disorder. People with adhd are always late, can focus like everyone else but focus for too short or too long a time (normally thought of as \"distractable\" or \"hyperfocus\"), are not long term goal oriented aka impulsive, and struggle with planning and other time based activities.\n\nAny activity that requires your brain to calculate things in dimensions can help with ADHD/time processing.  e.g. Balancing exercises, 3D movies/VR.

Muscularity concerns were assessed with The Drive for Muscularity Scale (item responses ranging from 1\u2009=\u2009Never to 6\u2009=\u2009Always), which measures the degree of the respondents' preoccupation with increasing their muscularity.\n\nResults\n\nGay and bisexual males presented with higher drive for muscularity compared to heterosexual males (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.30, 95% CI\u2009=\u20090.17, 0.43, p\u2009< .0001). Prospective analysis using generalized estimating equations indicated that each unit increase in drive for muscularity was associated with increased odds of exhibiting significant depressive symptoms (OR\u2009=\u20091.23, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.05\u20131.44, p\u2009=\u2009.01), binge drinking (OR\u2009=\u20091.21, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.02\u20131.45, p\u2009=\u2009.03), dieting (OR\u2009=\u20091.17, 95% CI\u2009=\u20091.01, 1.35, p\u2009=\u2009.04), and use of muscle\u2010building products (OR\u2009=\u20094.49, 95% CI\u2009=\u20093.74, 5.40, p\u2009<\u2009.0001).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe drive for muscularity appears to be relatively prevalent across adolescence and early adulthood in males and is associated with broad and substantial health consequences.

So though you have a higher chance to get depressed, the actual severity of the depression is on average lower than those depressed that does not work out.  \n  \nThe reasoning for this is rather self-evident. If you already have the discipline to work out to build and maintain muscle mass (remember this is a **lifestyle**), then you are way more likely to have more stability and routine in life. It is highly unlikely that the discipline in working out, only applies to that one aspect and not other aspects in life. This because discipline and routine is trained behaviour.  \n  \nSecond. You are way more likely to get laid if you are muscular. I'm suffering from depression and I can say with zero doubt that if I had more sex (I average maybe 2-3 times a year) I would be way happier. Sex deprivation is a **major** psychological contributor to unhappiness. If not for the sex, then for the intimacy.  \n  \nThe exception to this is people who become mentally ill in that they never feel they are big enough and have a constant negative self-image. Those people (happens often to body builders) will probably not be affected positively by these off-sets at all.  \n  \nHowever for the \"average joe\" who is overly preoccupied with building muscle, and manages to improve their self image, physique and health - I firmly believe that this group of people though with a higher chance of being depressed, will severely reduce the negative effects of depression in comparison to a person with depression that does not work out.

The idea is that if you say 30 and fix it in 15 they will be happy because you've exceeded their expectations. If you say 15 and it goes to 30 you've not met their expectations. People do this with themselves as well. If you're constantly told you're a genius, that may be all well and good if you're one of the rare people who are a genius but it's likely you're not a genius and the real world will expose you to this fact and crush what you expected, add handsome, strong, witty, funny, whatever you'd like to that and if they aren't true you're going to end up with a low self esteem from constantly failing to meet the expectations you have of yourself. Oddly, enough while this would be depressing, it could also serve as a benefit if it caused you to push yourself beyond what you may have been able to achieve if you set realistic expectations but only if the depression didn't serve you so badly as to be unhealthy and cause.

Acceptance has been linked with greater psychological health, which we propose may be due to the role acceptance plays in negative emotional responses to stressors: acceptance helps keep individuals from reacting to\u2014and thus exacerbating\u2014their negative mental experiences. Over time, experiencing lower negative emotion should promote psychological health. To test these hypotheses, Study 1 (N = 1,003) verified that habitually accepting mental experiences broadly predicted psychological health (psychological well-being, life satisfaction, and depressive and anxiety symptoms), even when controlling for potentially related constructs (reappraisal, rumination, and other mindfulness facets including observing, describing, acting with awareness, and nonreactivity). Next, in a laboratory study (Study 2, N = 156), habitual acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotional responses to a standardized stressor. Finally, in a longitudinal design (Study 3, N = 222), acceptance predicted lower negative (but not positive) emotion experienced during daily stressors that, in turn, accounted for the link between acceptance and psychological health 6 months later. This link between acceptance and psychological health was unique to accepting mental experiences and was not observed for accepting situations. Additionally, we ruled out potential confounding effects of gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and life stress severity. Overall, these results suggest that individuals who accept rather than judge their mental experiences may attain better psychological health, in part because acceptance helps them experience less negative emotion in response to stressors. \n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "ecl8lpt", "post_id": "a9n52v", "comment": "It sure beats the alternative.

This research tested the robustness of the weapons effect using two large representative samples of American adults (total *N* = 1,097). **Participants saw photos of criminals, soldiers, police in military gear, or police in regular gear with guns.** Experiment 2 also included a condition with photos of Olympians with guns used to shoot inanimate targets. The control group was police in plainclothes without guns. The accessibility of aggressive thoughts was measured using a word fragment task (e.g., KI\\_ \\_ can be completed as KILL or KISS). Photos of individuals with guns used to shoot human targets primed aggressive thoughts, regardless of whether a \u201cgood guy\u201d (soldier, police) or \u201cbad guy\u201d (criminal) held the gun. Photos of Olympians with guns used to shoot inanimate targets did not prime aggressive thoughts.\n\nEmphases mine.\n\nSo what is happening here, it seems, is that they are testing whether or not the weapons effect (which, to my understanding, is a well established theoretical effect -- correct me if I am wrong) is a robust concept, doing so by using guns. This article doesn't actually intend to imply that guns (designed for self defence), *specifically and solely*, causes this phenomenon of increased aggression; for it to do that, it would not only need to establish a correlation between viewing guns and increased aggression, but establish *a lack of correlation* between viewing things that are / could be weapons (people holding tactical knives or truncheons, people holding hammers or bats while appearing to have violent intent, etc.) and increased aggression. It merely seeks to determine whether or not the weapons effect is a valid, existant concept.\n\nThose who would use this article as an argument for reducing the prevalence of firearms in society would be committing a sort of \"scientific appropriation\". They would be using a study to prove a conclusion which is completely unrelated to the conclusion that was meant to determined by the study; They would be using the principles, and findings of science inappropriately. Perhaps this study could be used to justify reducing the prevalence of *weapons* in society, but there are practical considerations to make when looking at this problem, all of which stand outside the purview of science.\n\nOn a different note, while a word fragment task may be effective in measuring \"the accessibility of aggressive thoughts\", does that actually determine whether or not someone is having aggressive thoughts? I mean, if you showed anything that could be indicative of aggression, be it a weapon, a person, or an activity, wouldn't people be thinking of aggressive words just because they are the most relevant things to what they were seeing, and not because they are more aggressive at that moment? I would think that a better method of measuring if someone got more aggressive as a consequence of viewing the pictures would be to have them write out a solution to a problem which could be answered with or without violence.\n\nThis study doesn't actually determine what it set out to determine, I don't believe. Additional research will be necessary.\n\nSpeaking of the photos, I don't know the content of the photos; were the people pictured just loitering with weapons, or actively using them? How does one tell if someone is a criminal with a gun unless they are doing a criminal thing in that moment? Do you just declare they are a criminal (and does that not undermine the integrity of the study), or are they doing criminal things with the weapons (in which, if you wanted to keep things consistent, you would also picture \"good guys\" doing things with the weapons)? Does active use of weapons, or merely images of violence (without weapons), increase aggression, perhaps more so than just people loitering with weapons? And how would we know from this study; how do we know if the participants are reacting to the weapons or the violence?\n\nEdits: additional comments"}, {"comment_id": "ev1rnoo", "post_id": "ci1npg", "comment": ">The accessibility of aggressive thoughts was measured using a word fragment task (e.g., KI\\_ \\_ can be completed as KILL or KISS).\n\nThis is kind of ridiculous though, as a measurement of aggression.\n\nIts like if someone stood you next to a big cow, and asked you to complete \"BEE\\_\".
