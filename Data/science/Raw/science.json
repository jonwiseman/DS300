I never got around to doing anything about it, but this man is one of the big reasons I kept coming back. Just last night, some kind of spark was reignited for some reason, and I went back to a lot of old theory - rifling through my school textbooks, just enjoying the feeling of learning.

This is *huge* news! (I know we say that a lot in astronomy, but honestly, we are lucky enough to live in very exciting times for astronomy!) First of all, while the existence of black holes has been accepted for a long time in astronomy, it's one thing to see effects from them (LIGO seeing them smash into each other, [see stars orbit them](https://www.reddit.com/r/educationalgifs/comments/bb6gj8/trajectories_of_stars_orbiting_the_supermassive/), etc) and another to *actually get a friggin' image of one*.  Even if to the untrained eye it looks like a donut- let me explain why!\n\nNow what the image shows is not of the hole itself, as gravity is so strong light can't escape there, but related to a special area called the [event horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event_horizon), which is basically the \"point of no return\" after which you cannot escape. (It should be noted that the black hole is *not* actively sucking things into it like a vacuum, just like the sun isn't actively sucking the Earth into it.) As such, what we are really seeing here is not the black hole itself- light can't escape once within the event horizon- but rather all the matter swirling around and falling in.  In the case of the M87 black hole, it's estimated about 90 Earth masses of material falls onto it every day, so there is plenty to see relative to our own [Sag A*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sagittarius_A*).\n\nNow, on a more fundamental level than \"it's cool to have a picture of a black hole,\" there are a ton of unresolved questions about fundamental physics that this result can shed a relatively large amount on.  First of all, the entire event horizon is an insanely neat result predicted by general relativity (GR) to happen in extreme environments, so to actually see that is a great confirmation of GR.  Beyond that, general relativity breaks down when so much mass is concentrated at a point that light cannot escape, in what is called a [gravitational singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity), where you treat it as having infinite density when using general relativity.  We don't think it literally is infinite density, but rather that our understanding of physics breaks down. (There are also several secondary things we don't understand about black hole environments, like the mechanism of how [relativistic jets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astrophysical_jet) get beamed out of some black holes.) We are literally talking about a regime of physics that Einstein didn't understand, and that we can't test in a lab on Earth because it's so extreme, and there is literally a booming sub-field of theoretical astrophysics trying to figure out these questions.  Can you imagine how much our understanding of relativity is going to change now that we actually have *direct imaging* of an event horizon?  It's priceless!\n\nThird, this is going to reveal my bias as a radio astronomer, but... guys, this measurement and analysis was amazingly *hard* and I am in awe of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) team and their tenacity in getting this done.  I know several of the team and remember how dismissed the idea was when first proposed, and [have observed at one of the telescopes used for the EHT](https://www.reddit.com/r/Andromeda321/comments/8tfhgr/guess_whos_observing_tonight_at_the_submillimeter/) (for another project), and wanted to shed a little more on just why this is an amazing achievement.   Imagine placing an orange on the moon, and deciding you want to resolve it from all the other rocks and craters with your naked eye- *that* is how detailed this measurement had to be to resolve the event horizon.  To get that resolution, you literally have to link radio telescopes across the planet, from Antarctica to Hawaii, by calibrating each one's data (after it's shipped to you from the South Pole, of course- Internet's too slow down there), getting rid of systematics, and then co-adding the data.  This is so incredibly difficult I'm frankly amazed they got this image in as short a time as they did! (And frankly, I'm not surprised that one of their two targets proved to be too troublesome to debut today- getting even this one is a Nobel Prize worthy accomplishment.)\n\nA final note on that- why M87?  Why is that more interesting than the black hole at the center of the galaxy?  Well, it turns out even with the insanely good resolution of the EHT, which is the best we can do until we get radio telescopes in space as it's limited by the size of our planet, there are only two black holes we can resolve.  Sag A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our galaxy that clocks in at 4 million times the mass of the sun, we can obviously do because it's relatively nearby at \"only\" 25,000 light years away.  M87's black hole, on the other hand, is 7 billion times the mass of the sun, or 1,700 *times* bigger than our own galaxy's supermassive black hole.  This meant its effective size was half as big as Sag A* in in the sky despite being 2,700 times the distance (it's ~54 million light years).  The reason it's cool though is it's such a monster that it M87 emits these giant jets of material, unlike Sag A*, so there's going to now be a ton of information in how those work!\n\nAnyway, this is long enough, but I hope you guys are as excited about this as I am and this post helps explain the gravity of the situation!  It's amazing both on a scientific and technical level that we can achieve this!\n\nTL;DR- This is a big deal scientifically because we can see an event horizon and test where general relativity breaks down, but also because technically this was super duper hard to do.  Will win the Nobel Prize in the next few years.\n\nEdit: A lot of questions about why Sag A* wasn't also revealed today.

We weren't born into money but my mother worked her ass off with 4 kids to get her Masters in medicine to become a nurse practitioner, but that didn't happen until I was about 14 so she taught us good money habits from a super young age. BUT, even she didn't understand this college loan shit. Not until she started paying for some of it to help us out did she really understand what was happening. So, I think parents with kids that are 13-17 at the moment should be talking to their kids about student loans **right the fuck now**. Not about what they wanna be when they grow up. Not about what school they want to go to.

They just \"forgive\" the tuition fee, thus allowing them to pay lower wages, because students don't have to require wages to pay that tuition out of.\n\nFor the system that means basically the tuition gets removed from the system twice. As part of the wage, and as part of the revenue of the universities.\n\n**The outrage**: Taxing things that you DIDN'T pay. If that logic was broadly applied, homeless people would have to pay taxes for meals received at the soup kitchen. If you get anything for free as promotion, or gift. that would all have to be declared as income. Which is on one level ludicrous. (even more absurdly: Technically if you get a tax deduction, it would have to be counted as taxable income, which is the outcome of taxing things you DIDN'T earn.....). It creates a giant question mark in terms of \"perks of a job\". What kind of benefits to you by having a certain job should be quantified and taxed? How about a company car? Do you have to declare that? Do you apply \"common leasing rates\"?\n\n**The justification**: You can't just remove ANY gift from taxation, because it allows for massive tax evasion. There is a difference for the system whether you get peanuts as wages but board and food as \"gift\", or getting a proper wage that gets taxed and have to PAY for accommodation and for your food (each being taxed as income for the provider)\n\nIn this case the universities basically are skirting their dues by artificially reducing their revenue (tuition fees not taken in) but compensating it with lower wages, thus reducing the payroll tax on the students side.\n\n**The flaw**:\nTHe flaw is that this AGAIN is  putting the pressure on the weakest people IN this situation, by now taxing the forgiven tuition as income, as IF they had received it as income and then paid it, thus making receiving the waiver unattractive, thus forcing the students to demand wages that allows them to PAY the tuition, which then gets taxed as revenue on the universities side.  \nedit: Additional flaw: It doesn't work. The workaround for the university is to increase the wages by JUST the amount the students have to pay as taxes, this STILL doesn't force them to pay taxes on their forgiven revenue (basically implying that universities are lobbying hard enough to skirt THAT part of the problem)\n\n**Solution**: If the goal is to prevent universities to apply this trick, but not want to punish the students, the tuition would have to be tax deductible. Basically the whole problem only arises because of for-profit education to begin with.\n\n**Additional observation**:\nThe above is independent from observations or disagreement of how the actual tax burden is distributed in the US. It doesn't address how the worst offenders against the common good get the most lenient tax deductions and lowest taxes, or why specifically for profit education is under the microscope here, rather than other ways to avoid contributing to society.\n\n**Tl;dr** :\n\nJust calling it a 300% increase is dishonest and misses the issue in an effort to foster outrage."}, {"comment_id": "dq25892", "post_id": "7e1jo1", "comment": "This is absolutely insane. Along with point 1 (echos what the initial post said) here\u2019s a couple other crazy things this bill does: \n1) GRADUATE STUDENTS GET TAXED ON MONEY THEY NEVER SEE. This means graduate students would instantly start being taxed on $30-50-60K per year of tuition money they get \"waived\". So they basically pay taxes on money they've never seen and never will see. \n2) REPEALS THE STUDENT INTEREST LOAN DEDUCTION. EVERYONE with student loans who makes under 80k (160K) for couples should be against this. It takes away $2500 of deductible income from you every year. \n3) FREE TUITION BENEFITS FOR FAMILY MEMBERS GET TAXED AS INCOME. So now the people who worked for years for a university so they could get their kids free tuition will have to pay income taxes on that. Which could literally be impossible for some people. If you make 50K and you have two kids in college at the same time for 50K each, you'll get taxed as if you had 150K worth of income.

These experiments have returned mixed results. However, there are other ways that a VVG can be realistic besides looking like the real world. More specifically, things in VVGs can not only look realistic, they can also behave realistically. It may be the case that this kind of realism leads to increases in the activation of aggressive concepts, rather than increases in graphical realism.\n\n> In this paper, we therefore present two large-scale online experiments (n\u202f=\u202f898 and n\u202f=\u202f1880) which investigate the effects of two different manipulations of behavioural realism on the activation of aggressive concepts in VVGs. In neither experiment did increasing realism increase the activation of aggressive concepts.\n\n> Realism is often described as increasing the effects of VVGs.

Here, a 66-yr-old female presented with nil requirement for postoperative analgesia after a normally painful orthopaedic hand surgery (trapeziectomy). Further investigations revealed a lifelong history of painless injuries, such as frequent cuts and burns, which were observed to heal quickly. We report the causative mutations for this new pain insensitivity disorder: the co-inheritance of (i) a microdeletion in dorsal root ganglia and brain-expressed pseudogene, FAAH-OUT, which we cloned from the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) chromosomal region; and (ii) a common functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in FAAH conferring reduced expression and activity. Circulating concentrations of anandamide and related fatty-acid amides (palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamine) that are all normally degraded by FAAH were significantly elevated in peripheral blood compared with normal control carriers of the hypomorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism.

"}, {"comment_id": "ejkpwwb", "post_id": "b6hy7e", "comment": "Alright, for those of you that need an ELI5 for the actual science, buckle up.\n\n> We report the causative mutations for this new pain insensitivity disorder: the co-inheritance of (i) a microdeletion in dorsal root ganglia and brain-expressed pseudogene, FAAH-OUT, which we cloned from the fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) chromosomal region; and (ii) a common functional single-nucleotide polymorphism in FAAH conferring reduced expression and activity.\n\nAlright. We know what mutations are, right? A change in the structure of a gene? Sometimes there's a *microdeletion*, which is the loss of a tiny piece of genetic material that may be too small to be seen readily through a microscope. You have to use really specialized imaging methods (e.g. high-resolution chromosome banding, molecular chromosome analysis (with FISH), or DNA analysis). \n\nThere's also this thing called a single-nucleotide polymorphism (or SNP, pronounced \"snip\"), which is a change in a single base pair in the DNA. SNPs are natural in the genome, occurring about once every 1000 base pairs. While they technically have no effect on health or development (not in the same way that other mutations do), they can predict an individual\u2019s response to certain drugs, susceptibility to environmental factors such as toxins, and risk of developing particular diseases. \n\nNow onto what this FAAH thing is. Fatty-acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is the major catabolic enzyme for a range of bioactive lipids called fatty-acid amides (FAAs). As a refresher, \"catabolic enzymes\" break things down into smaller parts and release energy. These FAAs act as ligands for cannabinoid receptors (i.e. endocannabinoids). In mice, when you knock out FAAH altogether, they have a decreased pain response to acute thermal stimuli, and show reduced pain when you introduce inflammation-causing agents. This is really important because manipulating FAAH has mostly worked in *animals*, but most clinical trials that manipulate FAAH in *humans* has failed, for one reason or another. \n\nNow, contrasting to that, when you introduce this particular SNP into FAAH, it significantly reduces the activity of FAAH, and somehow has an enhanced effect on fear-extinction learning while decreasing anxiety-linked behaviors. This is important because it matches the phenotype of the case study patient, who doesn't actually appear to learn \"fire = hot\" like other people do, because she has had a gradual decrease in reaction to stimuli that most people are averse to (heat, pain, etc). \n\nSo, to put this all together, the researchers here hypothesize that because of the *combination* of a microdeletion (a tiny piece of missing DNA) and a SNP (one base pair difference) in the FAAH coding genes, this lady has a decreased or nonexistent pain response to what would normally be painful experiences (e.g. surgery).\n\nSo, onto the results:\n\n> Circulating concentrations of anandamide and related fatty-acid amides (palmitoylethanolamide and oleoylethanolamine) that are all normally degraded by FAAH were significantly elevated in peripheral blood compared with normal control carriers of the hypomorphic single-nucleotide polymorphism. The genetic findings and elevated circulating fatty-acid amides are consistent with a phenotype resulting from enhanced endocannabinoid signalling and a loss of function of FAAH. \n\nWhat they're basically saying is that, molecules that are normally broken down by FAAH and not seen in blood, are present in her blood, leading the researchers to believe that the mutation is doing exactly what they thought it did.\n\nOne of the important things here is that the chromosomal area that codes FAAH was previously thought to be a \"junk\" sequence, meaning that it's basically there to take up space. This does open the door to a more detailed search of \"junk\" sequences to see if they're actually encoding useful things.\n\nQuestions? Comments? Concerns?

Here, the effect of increasing the impact endurance increases up to sixfold. It is found that dispersed reinforced concretes with an increased ratio of static tensile strength to static compressive strength Rtens/Rcompr and ductility possess the best endurance to dynamic action. It is proved that this ratio can be increased by using dispersed reinforcement of concretes (so-called fibrous concretes). In experimental studies on penetration of both unreinforced and fiber-reinforced concrete slabs, it is noted that samples of unreinforced concrete are completely fractured into large and small pieces, while samples of fiber-reinforced concrete are not completely fractured, and only through penetration at the impact site was observed; that is, fibrous concrete possesses better impact resistance. These results can be applied to the design of various special structures, such as defense structures of civil defense and emergency situations, fortifications of the Russian Ministry of Defense, and concrete structures of nuclear power plants."}, {"comment_id": "f6ckbh6", "post_id": "dqysmm", "comment": "Cement is not the same as concrete.

Survival analysis of the time to autism diagnosis with Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios of autism according to MMR vaccination status, with adjustment for age, birth year, sex, other childhood vaccines, sibling history of autism, and autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score).\n\n>**Results:**  During 5\u00a0025\u00a0754 person-years of follow-up, 6517 children were diagnosed with autism (incidence rate, 129.7 per 100,000 person-years). Comparing MMR-vaccinated with MMR-unvaccinated children yielded a fully adjusted autism hazard ratio of 0.93 (95% CI, 0.85 to 1.02). Similarly, no increased risk for autism after MMR vaccination was consistently observed in subgroups of children defined according to sibling history of autism, autism risk factors (based on a disease risk score) or other childhood vaccinations, or during specified time periods after vaccination.\n\n>**Limitation:**  No individual medical chart review was performed.\n\n>**Conclusion:**  The study strongly supports that MMR vaccination does not increase the risk for autism, does not trigger autism in susceptible children, and is not associated with clustering of autism cases after vaccination. It adds to previous studies through significant additional statistical power and by addressing hypotheses of susceptible subgroups and clustering of cases.\n\n>**Primary Funding Source:**  Novo Nordisk Foundation and Danish Ministry of Health.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "ehsr9nf", "post_id": "axd4l4", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ehszj8w", "post_id": "axd4l4", "comment": "People keep asking \"well then what *does* cause autism?\n\nLots of things can.

Exploiting the phenomenon of leafless (photosynthetically inactive) tree remnants being kept alive by conspecifics, we show tight physiological coupling of a living kauri (Agathis australis) stump to conspecific neighbors. The trunk remnant displayed greatly reduced, inverted daily sap flow patterns compared with intact kauri trees. Its stem water potential showed strong diel variation with minima during daytime and maxima at night, coinciding with peak and minimal sap flow rates in neighbors, respectively. Sudden atmospherically driven changes in water relations in adjacent kauri trees were very rapidly and inversely mirrored in the living stump's water status. Such intimate hydrological coupling suggests a \u201ccommunal physiology\u201d among (conspecific) trees with far-reaching implications for our understanding of forest functioning, particularly under water shortage."}, {"comment_id": "euyyhil", "post_id": "chwg8s", "comment": "You mean what they said in Avatar is true?

As a tribute to him, we used Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Health Statistics to update these analyses and review critiques of the original article. The conclusion that prices are the primary reason why the US spends more on health care than any other country remains valid, despite health policy reforms and health systems restructuring that have occurred in the US and other industrialized countries since the 2003 article\u2019s publication. On key measures of health care resources per capita (hospital beds, physicians, and nurses), the US still provides significantly fewer resources compared to the OECD median country. Since the US is not consuming greater resources than other countries, the most logical factor is the higher prices paid in the US. Because the differential between what the public and private sectors pay for medical services has grown significantly in the past fifteen years, US policy makers should focus on prices in the private sector.\n"}, {"comment_id": "ediigki", "post_id": "admli1", "comment": "Now the insurance companies just buy the hospitals in the US and pay them selves.

At least, the public health guys at my med school have known this for a while. The real mystery is WHY the healthcare costs are so disparate between the United States and other nations. And the answer, which may surprise you, is more than likely not due to greed.\n\nThat is to say, public hospitals like state and federal hospitals, and other not-for-profits do not have high prices listed on their chargemaster because somebody somewhere is pocketing this cash en-masse. The highest paid people at these non-profit hospitals (which compose 80% of US hospitals) are specialist surgeons and diagnosticians, and their salary composes only about 10% of healthcare expenditure in the United States. Think about this, if you halve the salaries of all US physicians, your $40,000 bill will only go down by about $2000 to $38000. The vast majority of expenditure in the modern US healthcare system is due to the monstrosity of the hospital. Insurance companies aren\u2019t pocketing this, because remember, we have not included them in this consideration. There are no shareholders pocketing it, and even though physicians are well compensated in the United States (equivalent to Canada and some European countries), most of your money isn\u2019t going there.\n\nSo why the hell is it so much more expensive in the United States? Public health guys are having a hard time figuring out, but right now the large culprit is a massive conglomeration of inefficiencies. A large amount of funds are funneled to administration, in terms of handling the bureaucracies, paperwork, and negotiations of interacting with insurance companies\u2014so when I said insurance companies are not responsible earlier, that was only MOSTLY true. Additionally, because of the highly litigious nature of healthcare in the United States, there is much more infrastructure involved in defending against lawsuits. Lots of what many people might consider unnecessary testing and imaging are performed because even though there is a high likelihood that what they\u2019re testing for isn\u2019t what\u2019s going on, there\u2019s still a 1% chance, for example, that they miss a critical, life-threatening diagnosis. \n\nThere\u2019s also a cultural element: that is, in the United States, even when somebody is on the end of their ropes, for some reason people in this country have the mentality that \u201ceverything must be done to save my family member.\u201d Even if those efforts prolong the suffering of the patient and cost of care enormously. How much do you think one ICU days cost? Now, how many days do you think it takes the average US citizen to decide \u201cenough is enough, grandpa isn\u2019t getting better\u201d compared to European countries? As a comparison, in the UK, if you\u2019re over 70, dialysis is straight-up refused if you\u2019re in renal failure. This is almost certainly a death sentence. Whereas in the United States, we have an entire branch of Medicare that covers the cost so long as you paid your FICA.\n\nThere are quite a few additional measures, like improving the overall public health in the United States (obesity, heart disease, etc), limiting exposure to trauma-causing devices (ahem), which would likely improve healthcare costs. It is much more efficient in terms of length of life gained and cost of care to prevent a disease, than to try to cure it. \n\nAxing insurance, setting wait-lists for elective procedures, improving public health measures, and after all this taking a heavy dissecting knife to the administrational inefficiencies BECAUSE of all the aforementioned reasons are the best ways of cutting out the fat of our healthcare costs."}, {"comment_id": "edihjl8", "post_id": "admli1", "comment": "In addition to the high cost for equipment, drugs, and supplies, the doctors and nurses have college loans to pay off.

Here we describe the Cerutti Mastodon (CM) site, an archaeological site from the early late Pleistocene epoch, where in situ hammerstones and stone anvils occur in spatio-temporal association with fragmentary remains of a single mastodon (Mammut americanum). The CM site contains spiral-fractured bone and molar fragments, indicating that breakage occured while fresh. Several of these fragments also preserve evidence of percussion. The occurrence and distribution of bone, molar and stone refits suggest that breakage occurred at the site of burial. Five large cobbles (hammerstones and anvils) in the CM bone bed display use-wear and impact marks, and are hydraulically anomalous relative to the low-energy context of the enclosing sandy silt stratum. 230Th/U radiometric analysis of multiple bone specimens using diffusion\u2013adsorption\u2013decay dating models indicates a burial date of 130.7\u2009\u00b1\u20099.4 thousand years ago. These findings confirm the presence of an unidentified species of Homo at the CM site during the last interglacial period (MIS 5e; early late Pleistocene), indicating that humans with manual dexterity and the experiential knowledge to use hammerstones and anvils processed mastodon limb bones for marrow extraction and/or raw material for tool production.

I hope that you all find it useful :)!** \n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\nPaleontologist here,\n\nI'd just like to say a few things based on the comments I'm seeing here: \n\n&nbsp;\n\nFirst off, my qualifications: My current advisor is the third author on this paper and I worked under (and collaborated with) the second author when I worked at the San Diego Natural History Museum (in fact, I re-prepared some of the material in this paper about 6 years ago). Furthermore, I am a doctoral student in the final months (hopefully) of my PhD. My dissertation work has been on proboscideans (elephants and their relatives), but I have also done a fair amount of work on cetaceans (whales) and other vertebrates.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs far as the dating methods go, this site was dated using multiple types of absolute dating methods, which all resulted in a very similar age. However, the Uranium-series dating (not to be confused with radiocarbon dating, which could not give you an accurate age this old) that was used here got results with a *very* high confidence. In fact there is essentially no evidence of alteration that might lead to an older date (which really would not be common anyways). The dates recovered are almost unimpeachable (and I don't say that lightly). I would be very surprised if a geochronologist or any other expert had a major problems with the dates themselves (in fact a geochronologist was a reviewer for this paper for just this reason). Also, to the people that are saying that it is perhaps time to reassess our methods of isotopic dating in general, I strongly suggest you spend more time researching and trying to understand these methods before you make a claim like this...\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOne other misconception that I keep seeing here are peoples' interpretation of what is meant by \"human\" in this paper. \"Human\" is meant here in the sense of a species of the genus *Homo*, not necessarily *Homo sapiens* specifically. In fact, because of the old age it seems fairly unlikely that this would be the modern species of human rather than some other [unknown] species.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI'm sure there will be other questions or comments here throughout the next day or so, and I will try to check in from time to time and update this post. I'm also happy to answer any questions that I can (to the best of my knowledge).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHope this is at least somewhat helpful!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit 1: To the folks wondering if this site could have been scavenged by humans (as opposed to hunted), I would say that, that is absolutely possible. In fact there is really no evidence one way or another to argue for hunting over scavenging at this site, and I don't believe that this paper takes a stance on this either. In fact, I would say that the argument of hunting vs scavenging in association with this mastodon is somewhat irrelevant. What is important is that this extremely old site (relatively speaking, anyways) has fairly clear association with ancient human activity. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit 2: Several people have pointed out that the article discusses a lack of evidence of meat stripping on the specimen. This does suggest scavenging, as it likely means the soft tissue was at least somewhat rotted and not usable. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit 3: Many people are suggesting that this animal could have been scavenged or had its bones modified many thousands of years after its death (i.e., implying the tools are much younger than the mastodon). To that point 1) the type of breakage seen on these bones is indicative of damage while the bone was still fresh. Fresh bone (sometimes called \"green bone\") breaks in a very different \"spiral pattern\" than older dried out bone; and 2) you have to remember that the sediments that the tools and mastodon are found in represent the context in which they were buried. Therefore since these materials were all found within the same layer they must have been buried at the same time. It is possible that ancient humans exhumed old bones (though I know of no actual evidence of this), **but** we would see telltale signs of disturbance to the sediment (which was not observed here). \n\n\nIn other words, I don't think that arguments about this site will come down to whether the material is associated and coeval, but whether folks think that these artifacts are indeed stone tools. Those people who do not agree with this identification will then have to reconcile the crazy taphonomy at this site and attribute it to some other natural process (which will be no small feat, IMHO).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nEdit 4: For the people asking why we don't have any evidence of humans (or human remains) in North America in the time between the age of this site and more generally accepted dates:\n\n\nFirst off, I would just like to note that we are almost certainly not talking about a direct lineage of humans between the time of this site and those of Clovis times (in fact, as I've stated above, we are likely not even talking about the same species). This was likely a very small population of humans that made it to North America that probably died out long before the modern species of human ever made it over. In that sense, there isn't necessarily a gap of time to \"bridge\".\n\n\nAs for why potential sites might not be preserved: There are a couple of reasons that you might not have evidence of humans found from this time. First off, you may not have rocks of the right age readily exposed in the region where the individuals were living (which is somewhat the case on the west coast, as far as I am aware). Second, the individuals could be living in an environment that is not conducive to preserving fossils (e.g., organisms that live in montane environments tend to not preserve in the fossil record because sediments are not being deposited in those regions). Third, getting preserved in the fossil record (in general) is very rare, and if your study organism has a very small population size or is short lived (as we would expect in the case here) then you have a very very low probability of being preserved (let alone found and collected). Finally, even if these scenarios aren't the case, there is the possibility that scientists have just been looking in the wrong strata, region, or age."}, {"comment_id": "dgshsb4", "post_id": "67qs7r", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dgsmxli", "post_id": "67qs7r", "comment": "I guess that might mean humans got there way earlier but it was the later arrivals who survived to the modern days, because isn't that what the genetics says?"}, {"comment_id": "dgsqs0h", "post_id": "67qs7r", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dgsj03b", "post_id": "67qs7r", "comment": "How do they know it was butchered by humans, specifically?

I know there have been one or two of us already answering questions in this thread (I'm also a nearly-finished PhD student), but I thought I'd give the perspective of someone not involved directly in this research. I work on much older sites in Africa, although many of the basic ideas are translatable.\n\nThe Th/U dating seems reliable, although there'll need to be a more detailed paper published about the stratigraphy of the site. There may be one already, I'm not familiar with this area. That won't be the point of contention. What will cause disagreement here is whether the marks that we see on the bones, and the patterns of breakage on the tools, require hominin action.\n\nI've taken a look at the article and supplementary materials, and I don't think it's enough to base this claim. That's obviously something where it's better to look at the material in person, but what I'm seeing is consistent with a mix of trampling and other natural processes. The authors say that alternate hypotheses \"do not adequately explain the observed evidence\", but then the pictures they show don't seem to support that. The most concrete evidence seems to be a pattern of scratches along the surface of the bone, which *could* be produced by stone tools, but also by lots of other things. Same with the breakage pattern. And same with the broken stone. The stones have one or two features in common with intentional tools, but so do most broken rocks. \n\nAnyway, I'm not trying to bash this research. It's well done, and it could be the case that a more persuasive argument could be made without the length limits of Nature Letters. This is not my specific subfield, but that being said, I'm quite confident that the mainstream scientific consensus on the peopling of the Americas won't be changed by this research, unless something more compelling is published from this site. It's interesting, but it appears as though the evidence here fits with taphonomic processes just as well as with hominin action.\n\n*edit: It is also worth noting, as has been pointed out elsewhere, that Steven Holen does have a bit of a history of publishing articles about early settlement of the Americas.

I'm not opposed to big finds upending previous understandings, in fact, those kinds of finds are what makes studying human evolution so much fun (H. naledi, Laetoli Site S footprints, H. floresiensis, etc). \n\nTheir dating methodology seems sound (I'm no dating expert), as is the interpretation that the bones have green breaks. \n\nHowever, I have huge issues with 1) the \"hammer/anvils\" being the only \"tools\" found and 2) the few percussion marks found. Taphonomy and geochronology is a tricky thing, and natural processes do some weird stuff post-mortem. There's lots of processes that can cause bone modifications that look remarkably similar to hominin butchering activity.  Its the same reason many researchers are supremely skeptical about the Dikika \"cut-marked\" bone. I'm also not convinced that the deposits are not conflated. I work at Laetoli, and you can see stuff from younger deposits that have eroded away, now within older deposits. \n\nAlso, at 130ka, you would expect to see more advanced tools than simple hammer-anvil stuff. Even H. erectus had big ol' Acheulean hand-axes. If this were a ~3.0ma site in Africa, I wouldn't really blink at the interpretation of the association of the mastodon bones with simple tools. But the fact that there's no other tool/tool trash/tool use evidence is highly suspect to me.\n\n\nalso, this is to say nothing of the enormous gap in time periods.

In this study, we estimate methane emissions from an important downstream consumer of NG, the ammonia fertilizer industry, which commonly uses NG as a feedstock and a fuel for the production of ammonia and other upgraded products. Using a Google Street View (GSV) car equipped with a high-precision methane analyzer, we adopted a mobile sensing approach to measure methane mixing ratios along public roads that are downwind of the ammonia fertilizer plants. Useful data were collected from six plants, which represent >25% of the total number of U.S NG-based ammonia fertilizer plants, and use >20% of the total NG consumption by this industry. Based on the measured data, a source characterization model was applied to estimate the methane emission rates from the upwind plants. Assuming that the estimates are representative of emissions during normal operations of a plant, we calculated the NG loss rate (i.e. the ratio between NG emission rate and NG throughput). If the sampled plants are representative of the U.S. ammonia fertilizer industry, the industrial-averaged NG loss rate (\u00b1 standard deviation) is estimated to be 0.34% (\u00b10.20%), and the total methane emissions (\u00b1 standard deviation) from this industry are estimated to be 29 (\u00b118) Gigagram per year (Gg CH4/yr) in 2015\u20132016. This is significantly higher than the reported methane emissions of 0.2 Gg CH4/yr from the U.S. EPA\u2019s Facility Level Information on Greenhouse Gas Tools (FLIGHT).

Systems of tracking and sanctioning free riders can stabilize cooperation, but the origin of such tendencies is not well understood. Here, we provide evidence that children as young as 4 years old negatively evaluate and sanction free riders. Across six studies, we showed that these tendencies are robust, large in magnitude, tuned to intentional rather than unintentional noncontribution, and generally consistent across third- and first-party cases. Further, these effects cannot be accounted for by factors that frequently co-occur with free riding, such as nonconforming behaviors or the costs that free riding imposes on the group. Our findings demonstrate that from early in life, children both hold and enforce a normative expectation that individuals are intrinsically obligated to contribute to the common good."}, {"comment_id": "e2wxjzv", "post_id": "91b8gd", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e2x1pt4", "post_id": "91b8gd", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e2x31po", "post_id": "91b8gd", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e2wxnvj", "post_id": "91b8gd", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e2wriog", "post_id": "91b8gd", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e2x1ybn", "post_id": "91b8gd", "comment": "Previous research by Dr. Kiley Hamlin at the University of British Columbia has shown that [infants want to punish puppets whom they perceive to have done unfair acts](https://psych.ubc.ca/lab-of-the-month-infants-and-moral-development-with-dr-kiley-hamlin/)."}, {"comment_id": "e2x3gds", "post_id": "91b8gd", "comment": "Does anybody have the sample size?

So, do we focus on quitting (abstinence) or reduced risk?  Maybe vaping, maybe smoking fewer....?\n2.  Alcohol - do we say you shouldn\u2019t drink (abstinence)  or should you drink less, have an Uber in standby, etc.\n3.  Do we say don\u2019t own a gun (abstinence) or focus on training and licensing?  \n\nThe problem with teaching reduced risk is that it is complicated. If you teach people to reduce tobacco use - some will still die of lung cancer.  If you teach reduced risk related to sex, some people will still get an std or pregnant.\n\nSo, what do you think?  It\u2019s much easier to teach abstinence than reduced risk....don\u2019t have sex, don\u2019t smoke, don\u2019t own a firearm, etc.  but it doesn\u2019t work all that well.\n\nNearly every health or health condition can be broken down this way.

We present a tomato pan-genome constructed using genome sequences of 725 phylogenetically and geographically representative accessions, revealing 4,873 genes absent from the reference genome. Presence/absence variation analyses reveal substantial gene loss and intense negative selection of genes and promoters during tomato domestication and improvement. Lost or negatively selected genes are enriched for important traits, especially disease resistance. We identify a rare allele in the TomLoxC promoter selected against during domestication. Quantitative trait locus mapping and analysis of transgenic plants reveal a role for TomLoxC in apocarotenoid production, which contributes to desirable tomato flavor. In orange-stage fruit, accessions harboring both the rare and common TomLoxC alleles (heterozygotes) have higher TomLoxC expression than those homozygous for either and are resurgent in modern tomatoes.

I am a long time Girl Scout (11 years) and am now venturing forth unto my Gold Award.  The Girl Scout Gold Award is the highest award in girl scouting, it is equivalent to the Eagle Scout in Boy Scouts.  It teaches a lot of life skills with research, paperwork and interviews, but also with hosting workshops and reaching out to people. The project requires at least 80 hours of work, which I find less daunting then making the project leave a lasting affect (which is the other big requirement of the project).  To do that, I am creating a website that will be  a lasting resource for years to come.\n\nFor my project, I am raising awareness about AAC (Alternative Augmented Communication) devices.  Even though I am not an AAC user, I have see the way that they can help someone who is nonverbal through the experience of my best friend since elementary school.  I want to thank you for your help already with my project, by just being such a public figure that you are, I can say. \"An AAC device is a computer that someone uses when they are nonverbal (gets blank stares), you know like Professor Hawking's computer (then they all get it)\"  \n\nI have already presented at California State University Northridge and held a public workshop to raise awareness for AAC devices.  For my presentation, I explained what AAC devices are and how they new an option for people who are nonverbal.  They are such a new option, that many people do not know they exist.  As soon as my best friend knew that she could get an AAC device, she got one and it helped her innumerably.  Before she had it, all she had to communicate was yes and no, but when she got her device, there were so many more things for her to say.  One instance, where she was truly able to communicate was when we were working on our science fair project.  We had been researching the effects that different types of toilet paper had on the environment, and I had proposed that we write our data on a roll of toilet paper (clean), to make it creative and interesting when we had to present it to the class.  Before, she would have just said no to the idea if she did not like it, but we would not know why, but with her AAC device, she was able to be an active part of the project by saying no and explaining why, she said \"it was gross\".  That is true communication at it's finest and I have heard of other similar instances like this.  \n\nBut my project is not only for the potential AAC users, I am also aiming my project toward everyone else.  I want to get rid of some of the social awkwardness that comes with using an AAC device.  It is not that people are rude on purpose, they just do not know how to interact.  One instance of this that really stood out to me had to do with the movie \"The Theory of Everything.\"  I was reading an interview with Eddie Redmayne about how he got to meet you, in the interview he said that he had researched all about you and knew that you use an AAC device, but when he finally got to meet you, he did not know how to act and kept talking while you were trying to answer.  This awkwardness was not on purpose, but awareness and education on how to interact with AAC users, would help fix this situation.  My best friend also had problems with this same issue when she went to a new school. I addressed this with my project by holding a public workshop where AAC users and non AAC users came and learned about AAC devices.  They made their own low technology AAC boards and had to use them for the rest of the workshop to communicate. We also had high technology AAC devices for them to explore and learn about.  The non AAC user participants and were able to meet real AAC users.  To me, AAC is meant to break the barrier of communication, not put up new walls because of people's ignorance of the devices.\n\nTo quote The Fault in Our Stars, by John Green, \"My thoughts are stars, that can not be fathomed into constellations\". with an AAC Device, we were able to see just a few of those stars, and with more practice we will be able to see constellations.  With more wide spread use and knowledge of AAC devices this can happen for more people.  Thank your for taking to the time to answer everyone's questions - here are my questions for you:\n\n1. In what ways would you like to see AAC devices progress?\n\n2. As a user of an AAC device, what do you see as your biggest obstacle in communicating with non AAC users?\n\n3. What voice do you think in - your original voice or your AAC voice?\n\n4. What is one thing that everybody should know about AAC devices?\n\n5. What advice would you give to non AAC users talking to an AAC user?\n\n\nThank you!\nZoe\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "ctqkdbs", "post_id": "3eret9", "comment": "do we have any idea when approximately will be the 2nd part of the AMA?

The paper\u2019s abstract reads as following:\n\n> \u201cThe matter of friendly AI theory has so far almost exclusively been examined from a perspective of careful design while emergent phenomena in super intelligent machines have been interpreted as either harmful or outright dystopian. The argument developed in this paper highlights that the concept of \u2018friendly AI\u2019 is either a tautology or an oxymoron depending on whether one assumes a morally real universe or not. Assuming the former, more intelligent agents would by definition be more ethical since they would ever more deeply uncover ethical truths through reason and act in accordance with them while assuming the latter, reasoning about matters of right and wrong would be impossible since the very foundation of morality and therefore AI friendliness would be illogical. Based on evolutionary philosophy, this paper develops an in depth argument that supports the moral realist perspective and not only demonstrates its application to friendly AI theory \u2013 irrespective of an AI\u2019s original utility function \u2013 making AGI inherently safe, but also its suitability as a foundation for a transhuman philosophy.\u201d\n\nThe only reason to worry about transhumanly intelligent machines would be if one believed that matters of right and wrong are arbitrary constructs. A position very popular in post modern academic circles.

Whether our biological offspring or technological offspring go on, should not matter to us.\n\nIndeed, worrying about AI replacing us is analogous (albeit to a lesser extent) to worries about genetic engineering or bionic organ replacement.  Many people have made the argument that 'playing God' in these respects is unnatural and should not be allowed and this feels like an extension of that.\n\nSome of my colleagues have published a few papers showing that humans trust technology more when it's anthropomorphized or that we see things as unnatural as immoral. The worry about AI seems to be a product of this innate tendency to fear things that aren't natural. \n\nUltimately, I'm wondering what you're thoughts are about this?

I found a number of large problems with both the empiric data it was based on as well as its theoretical basis.\n\nLOAR is meant to show the unstoppable accelerating force that drives development of technology to greater and greater heights. As a basis of this, Kurzweil uses his observation that the continued [exponential growth in calculating power of computers](http://www.singularity.com/images/charts/MooresLaw.jpg). Even when the technology they were using were nearing the end of its life cycle and could no longer keep up, another technology simply replaced it with no major breaks in the graph. He then goes on to generalize this to be the case for all technology, even though the only other graph that shows a similar trend across different technologies is [this one on RAM](http://www.singularity.com/images/charts/ram.jpg).\n\nThe biggest problem with this is that Kurzweil makes the mistake of believing that when each technology was beginning to have problems continuously experiencing growth, the appearance of a solution in the form of a replacement technology was inevitable. He then goes on to assume that this will always continue to happen. This is called retrospective determinism and is a logical fallacy.\n\nKurzweil also repeatedly states that no external force, such as politics, economy, lack of resources, technological lock-in or social circumstances can have any major effect on the continued exponential growth of technology. This is very clear technological determinism, which is also problematic, as it keeps Kurzweil from being critical of his own theory.\n\nThe reason Kurzweil gives for the continued growth, despite external forces, is (at least in some of his books and essays) that technology is actually a continuation evolution, and is therefore a fundamental aspect of the universe: a natural law. This ignores that all natural examples of exponential growth experiences diminishing returns as necessary resources become scarce. It also displays a fundamental misunderstanding of how evolution works. Kurzweil implies that technological growth is a direct continuation of human evolutionary growth. With this he is hinting that human evolution is working towards a future change. Evolution is however not a sentient, and is as such not working *towards* any specific end-goals, [unlike Kurzweil](http://www.singularity.com/images/charts/CountdowntoSingularityLog.jpg).\n\nMuch of the empirical data is based around single sources, often websites that no longer exist. As his books have no methodology sections, the validity of the sources or how they are used is never discussed, leaving open questions of how you get a number for [calculations per second per $1000](http://www.singularity.com/charts/page70.html) for something that was never built like the Charles Babbage Analytical Engine.\n\nIn general, Kurzweils writing on the future has the effect of readers that when it touches upon their area of expertise it is obviously completely wrong, but the rest seems quite reasonable. I, myself am not an expert in artifical intelligence research, but Kurzweil is, so I could not hope to know whether his writing on that subject is more valid than his books on the singularity, but I assume so. Just be aware that years of living from innovation might have made Kurzweil too uncritical of his own theories."}, {"comment_id": "cthnv59", "post_id": "3eret9", "comment": "Hello Stephen.\n\nWhat is a typical day in your life like?"}, {"comment_id": "cthnmx1", "post_id": "3eret9", "comment": "I'm posting this on behalf of /u/WELLinTHIShouse, who is not currently available to ask it herself.\n\n>Professor Hawking, now that we've seen the [first apparent instance of a robot becoming self-aware at RPI](http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/uh-oh-this-robot-just-passed-the-self-awareness-test-1299362), a university which is local to me, what do you think is the most important concern when undertaking new research.

Futurists like Ray Kurzweil see these things becoming a reality as soon as 2045, with the current state of Moore\u2019s Law and the exponential rate of information technology.\n \nWhat are your thoughts on using AI to transcend our current state of biology and consciousness?\n \nIf it happened, would you consider this a natural part of evolution in the timeline of human development?"}, {"comment_id": "ctho7o8", "post_id": "3eret9", "comment": "Hello Professor Hawking. \n\nBostrom's fantastic work 'Superintelligence' outlined much of the risk which AI poses for me.

There's a host of symptoms, but the most severe one has been near-constant excruciating pain. It started off feeling exactly like the kidney stones that started this whole mess (autoimmune reaction ... or something -- doctors have no clue what's going on) and has only gotten worse from there. First I couldn't skate anymore, then I couldn't run, and now I can barely walk. I can't even go to the grocery store anymore. Worse, I feel like the pain has started chipping away at my sanity. I can't remember things anymore. I can't pay attention to anything for more than two minutes or so. I can't even read books because by the time I get to chapter 2 I've forgotten what was in chapter 1. Needless to say, I gone from being a straight-A student to failing 10th grade (though I suppose it doesn't really count as failing if you only attend for a quarter of the year) and am now in the process of failing 11th, too. It's been a constant battle to get the doctors to recognize and treat my illness, and I have been constantly been accused of seeking drugs or having Munchausens. I'm hoping that the new doctors I'm going to see will give me proper pain medication and that treating the pain will make it possible for me to think again, but in the meantime I'm wondering what sort of coping strategies you have. How do you keep your mind sharp even when almost completely paralyzed? How do you keep the stress from breaking you down?

However, I believe you would be one of the most well suited individuals to answer.\n\nRegarding black holes... It is generally accepted that as matter (or you and I on our spaceship) approaches a black hole, time dilation and spaghettification takes place, and that it is a generally unpleasant and violent experience. It makes sense to me that upon approaching a massive body like a star or gas giant, that destruction would be something perceived and experienced by the matter/people approaching, as the object and its gravitational pull and pressure are an \"understandable\" force, and time dilation would not slow to the point it would near a singularity. What I find difficult to wrap my head around is how we, if we were to approach an event horizon, would perceive these events, or if we ever would at all. All objects of mass create a \"dip\" in the fabric of space-time, though in the case of a black hole it is my understanding that the fabric of space-time is being warped and stretched to a point that is hardly conceivable (for me, anyway), the singularity being \"infinitely\" massive. Assuming, miraculously, there was no other matter immediately adjacent and jostling us for position (which would of course result in our destruction) would we on our approach even perceive this stretching and change in timeflow? To the outside, I would assume it would look like a very quick and violent demise, but I wonder that to the person going for the ride, so to speak, it would simply be a never-ending trip to oblivion.\n\nA less rambling version: when approaching a black hole, considering the bizarre effects on time and space, would one be able to perceive the change in time flow and the stretching of space-time around them as they themselves are in it? Could spaghettification take place without the person even realizing they are being spaghettified?\n\nIf that even is a possibility, as a follow-up, is it possible that objects, as they approach very near or actually enter the singularity, could continue on as though nothing has happened, since again, it is the space itself that has been bent and \"pulled out from underneath us?\" Or have I been relying too heavily on an analogy of objects making fabric imprints?"}, {"comment_id": "cthsv2d", "post_id": "3eret9", "comment": "Hello Professor Hawking\n\nI am chinese,so pardon my English,I had series thoughts about future.because my English is poor,so I make my comment simple and direct.\n\n1.the answer of a classic question \"who am I\" is our memory,what memory in my brain decide who I am.\n\n2.the life for us is sense.I feel I am alive then I am alive.if not,this kind of life is nosense to us.refer to vegetative state.\n\n3.if there is an operation can read my memory out and write into a new body's brain.what would happen? \"I feel I am still alive,just change a body\" do you think this make sense?\n\n4.what about original me thinking,he(original me)don't mind,because he is dead.this world has nothing to him.what about new me(I'd like call it as TA,chinese spelling,means she,he ,it) thinking?TA just feel like making a sleep and live again.but body changed,a new healthy body.and TA must think TA is me.because just my memory in TA's brain.\n\n5.what about the ethics?we can't ignore the human's desire of life.we will make the ethics fit our desire.it always do.\n\n6.what body can we choose?at least we can use the body made by our own sperm and egg.\n\n7.so if the read&write brain machine appeared,we can use it to make our live continue to forever.and if it is prohibited by the society,there must be someone do this privately.no one can prevent human trying to be immortal.\n\n8.if AI is enough to run our memory just like our brain.so the problem of ethics is solved.we can \"live \"in the AI's body.\n\n9:all what I said just a part of our future,you can follow these clues to figer out more questions about universe and life.such as Fermi Paradox.or I would like talk more to you if you have interesting.\n\n10:**if we calculate our civilization's period from the word appearance,and then we \"disappeared\" in thousand years(we invent read&write brain machine),then the whole human's civilization period just within ten thousand years.so what about prehistory civilization of other creature made on the earth?**\n\n11.**There is no exception we all use the first person view to feel our life,and use the third person view to observe the universe.so when we study the universe,the proper way to use is objective(science),but when we want to understand our life,we shoule use the way of subjective ,that means our feeling.otherwise,we should never know the essence of our life.we should take our subjective as objective to research  what the life is for us**\n\n12.**The recipe of life is:who am I(memory in my brain)+where am I(first person view)+consciousness(any creature's body has it,we can choose the fittest one)=I am alive**\n\n13.**If I put my memory into AI,then I(who I am) can get the AI's first person view and consciousness.so I am the terminator,this terminator think TA is me definitely.so don't worry about the AI has its own consciousness.it is a new way in the future for human being.**\n\n14.**about death,you know you are alive but you don't know you are died.just like you know you are awake,but you don't know you are asleep.\"are you sleeping?\"\"yeah,I am\"\"you lie to me\"**\n\n15.**because of no one know he has already died(refer to above),so the feeling of \"the special sleep\"is you think nothing else but you still live just change a new body after that read&write memory operation.and  maybe this sleeping can over a few decades even more.**\n\nps:I decide if have TA'S(new me) existing and TA feel that am I still alive.so do I wanna to become TA before my death.the answer is \"YES\".because I have fear nothing before death and I am very like to try this \"special sleep\".why not\n\n**http://news.discovery.com/tech/robotics/download-memories-retrieve-later-130603.htm (read memory experiment)**\n\n**http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0003832 (first person view experiment)**"}, {"comment_id": "cthnuc6", "post_id": "3eret9", "comment": "Thank you for doing this AMA, Professor Hawking!

How do employees perceive and respond to supervisors who treat the bottom line as more important than anything else? Supervisors who hold a bottom-line mentality (BLM) neglect competing priorities such as employee well-being and ethical practices to focus on securing bottom-line success. We find high-BLM supervisors serve as low-quality exchange partners with their employees, resulting in employee perceptions of low-quality leader-member exchange (LMX) relationships. In turn, employees reciprocate by withholding the very thing the supervisor desires\u2014performance\u2014in order to maintain balance in the exchange relationship. As such, supervisors who possess a BLM could actually be negatively impacting the organization\u2019s bottom line through the harmful social exchange relationships they engender with their employees and their impact on employee task performance. We also examine the moderating role of employee BLM on these relationships. When employee BLM is low, we observe a greater negative effect on employee value judgments of the supervisor (i.e. reduced LMX perceptions) and lower employee performance. We test and find support for all of our hypotheses in two multi-source (i.e. employee-supervisor dyads), time-lagged field studies (N = 189 and N = 244)."}, {"comment_id": "ev9mdyi", "post_id": "ciuld0", "comment": "Close friend of mine is in a leadership role and treats his teams very well.

Not having to rehire and retrain saves millions a year not to mention people working harder and the benefits therein.\n\nOne change that helps drive this culture is reviews.  Doing quarterly reviews and weekly 1:1 meetings.  Reviews focus on three things, productivity, culture, and enablement.  Are you achieving you goals?  Are you collaborating with others and working across boundaries/silos? Are you helping others learn and grow?  Each has the same weight.  Same three apply to leadership and management, not just front line teams.\n\nThis helps drive and build personal relationships, a manager who actually personally cares about their team will do more to help them grow and succeed and an employee who is respected and enabled is open and willing to take more chances, seek more opportunity and help foster growth."}, {"comment_id": "ev9kq7j", "post_id": "ciuld0", "comment": "Employees are the most valuable asset a company has.

Several years ago researchers studying the effects of excess modern day light exposure collected a bunch of writings and evidence on sleeping habits from around the world. What they found was that most people around the world would go to bed a few hours after dark, because candles and torches were generally expensive and didnt last long or provide much light.\nHowever, some parts of the world, especially in winter had up to 14+ hours a night. People would broadly wind down their days and them take up to 1-2 hours to fall asleep. (And sleep is actually work for your brain - certain types of focus actually are more conducive to good sleep than just collapsing and passing out like a ragdoll) \nThey would then sleep through 1-3 cycles of light->REM->NREM->REM->Light sleep. Then they would wake up. This is actually biologically healthy, and although we're not 100% sure why people would wake up in the middle of the night (theyd usually lucid dream, have sex, visit neighbors, eat a snack... generally low stress activities) we have a few good theories. \nOne is that it prevents our bodoes from going into a kind of fat-storing, dehydrating, hibernation mode which is very disorienting when we awake. It also makes sense to check for some food, and check ones safety (from an evolutionary biology standpoint - stuff can eat you in the middle of the night) \nIts also helpful from a cognitive standpoint. Sleep isnt supposed to be a konked out deep sleep all the time. Your brain needs the rhythmic movement between light-REM-NREM sleep to reset internal clocks and \"clean out\" the subconscious. \nAnd then, after being awake for 30-60 minutes, theyd go back to bed.  And sleep another 1-2 cycles and get up just before dawn. \n\nTwo of the biggest factors nowadays causing sleep deprivation and insomnia are light exposure ad inadequate relaxation time. Sleep is focused work for the brain, but we so seldom get the chance to lie down and relax during the day, that we try to relax when going to bed and just end up trying to process our day while also trying to will ourselves to sleep. Add to that excessive blue light and general wavelength light exposure from screens and fluorescent lights and you have yourself a health crisis. \n\nSo what can we do? \nHere's a few things I've found super effective. Try 'em, see if they help:\n\n1) Blue light:get f.lux, orange/yellow lenses, and minimize screen time and general light exposure 2-3 hours before bed. Also try to sleep in a room that is as dark as possible. \n\n2) do some focused relaxation and breathing before bed. Yoga, meditation, chill music, whatever to get some relaxation even just 15 minutes to cope with your day. This will help your mind race less when you go to bed. I always say 'your pillow is not thinking cap.'\n\n3) exercise! I know this is a dirty word, but besides being the most powerful natural nootropic, exercise also tells your body when its tired and helps put out \"tired\" hormones at night. Also try to embrace fidgeting and physical movement at work. Try to move around as much as possible during the day. 1-2pm is the highest physical energy time of day - if you're fidgeting it means your body wants to move, so move! Even a stretch break or pacing while you read helps. \n\n4) dont freak out if you wake up in the middle of the night. In fact, mentally prime yourself for the time you need to get up and get ready the next morning. Once you get in the habit of doing this, its like a sticky not on your Hippocampus. I dont use an alarm clock anymore because I can pretty much decide when I want to wake up the next morning. And going to bed and waking up at the same times is pretty much the best thing you can do for your sleep. The regularity matters more than the amount of time. Plenty of people get 8-9 hours sleep a day and are constantly tired. There are people who only get 5-6 who are super refreshed because their bed and waking times are consistent. Figure out what works best for you and stick to it. \n\n5) 2-day cycles. Sleep deprivation one day won't really hit you until the day after. Positive sleep wont really have the full refreshing effect until two days after. Always remember this and adjust expectations. \n\n6) happiness and learning. People who say report being satisfied, social and enjoying life are more likely to sleep well, and people who sleep well are more likely to be satisfied with their situation. Clarification: this is a complicated topic, which I don't have space to do justice to on mobile. Suffice to say that sleep and mental well-being both affect each other immensely. Doing things that promote mental wellness can lead to better sleep and vice versa, although every case is unique.\nAlso learn. Learning causes the subconscious to pick up and process bits of info we dont even consciously notice. Similar to exercise, if our brain has stuff to 'eat' and clear out, you'll dream more during REM sleep which actually helps the brain reset during sleep. Sleep is work for your brain, don't let it be bored. \n\n7) high quality protein/veggies. Less glutenous carbs means less inflammation and brain fog (no I'm not anti-gluten, but its generally a low quality carb) and longer lasting energy. The brain eats at night! tablespoon of honey b4 bed. You'll wale up hungry, but the complex carbs and quality sugars can actually help provide your brain good food  during the night. (Also eating a big keto dinner if you're into that sort of thing) \n\nHopefully you find one or several of those helpful. I dont personally do all of them every night, but even just 2-3 can make a big difference. And of course, disclaimer that every body is unique, so experiment! \n\nSource: I study sleep, brains, and learning."}, {"comment_id": "dsbfv0w", "post_id": "7opvxp", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dsbfvol", "post_id": "7opvxp", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dsbmhff", "post_id": "7opvxp", "comment": "So many students and teenagers pride themselves in their lack of sleep.

The claim in the title that cannflavins are \"30 times more powerful than aspirin\" was actually from a paper in 1985 (Source: M.L. Barrett, D. Gordon, F.J. Evans. Isolation from Cannabis sativa L. of cannflavin--a novel inhibitor of prostaglandin production Biochem. Pharmacol., 34 (1985), pp. 2019-2024). \n\nIn this article, they used a single type of human cells (cultured synovial cells from the joint) and look at a single type of inflammatory marker (PGE2) and conclude that cannflavin works better than aspirin by a factor of 30, but also works worse than some other drugs that we have (indomethacin by 18x, dexamethasone by over 100x).\n\nSo, although the new research is very interesting in an academic sense, it's not really correct to make any kind of comment on how this compound can be a new or better anti-inflammatory based on such little preliminary data from 35 years ago. Of note, if we were to discover that the cannflavins had interesting drug-like properties in humans, we would not be using the pathway described in this paper to make it, but rather more efficient organic syntheses that we have at our disposal.\n\nedit: thanks for the awards. I'm getting a lot of similar replies so I wanted to clarify a couple of things:\n\n1) Regarding the experiment from 1985, I was just pointing out that when you compare 4 things in a study, the conclusion in the news article shouldn't be \"look at how much better #3 was compared to #4\" without mentioning #1 and 2. I'm not peddling indomethacin or dexamethasone; just highlighting that the experiment gives far too little data to say that any of these are better than the others for human use.\n\n2) Cannflavins represent two out of potentially thousands of biologically active compounds in cannabis, if not more. For those of you who have had positive experiences with cannabis, there are many other molecules that can be studied to validate your experiences, even if this is not the one.

This study focused on two such compounds, known as cannflavin A and cannflavin B. These prenylated flavonoids specifically accumulate in C. sativa and are known to exhibit potent anti-inflammatory activity in various animal cell models. However, almost nothing is known about their biosynthesis. Using a combination of phylogenomic and biochemical approaches, an aromatic prenyltransferase from C. sativa (CsPT3) was identified that catalyzes the regiospecific addition of either geranyl diphosphate (GPP) or dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) to the methylated flavone, chrysoeriol, to produce cannflavins A and B, respectively. Further evidence is presented for an O-methyltransferase (CsOMT21) encoded within the C. sativa genome that specifically converts the widespread plant flavone known as luteolin to chrysoeriol, both of which accumulate in C. sativa. These results therefore imply the following reaction sequence for cannflavins A and B biosynthesis: luteolin \u25ba chrysoeriol \u25ba cannflavin A and cannflavin B. Taken together, the identification of these two unique enzymes represent a branch point from the general flavonoid pathway in C. sativa and offer a tractable route towards metabolic engineering strategies that are designed to produce these two medicinally relevant Cannabis compounds."}, {"comment_id": "eumvl4v", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "Pain absolutely, but I wonder what this might mean for inflammatory diseases like type 2 diabetes:\n\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21233852\n\nThis could be a game-changer."}, {"comment_id": "eun63de", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eune7yn", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "Queue the Bayer PR team to flood the news/social media industry with the evils of cannabis."}, {"comment_id": "euo5tog", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "Or the person can just take cannabis and not pay some useless greedy company for something that happens naturally."}, {"comment_id": "eun27bu", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eumolqd", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eumxy2f", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "I cannot take any anti-inflammatory medicines, so would this work differently than typical NSAIDS ?"}, {"comment_id": "eun8mog", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "This is good news, and I think cannabis has great potential, but... not all pain is inflammation based, so their ability to replace opioids here is being overstated."}, {"comment_id": "eun8nu4", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "And then keeping marijuana illegal and make the drug crazy expensive and requiring a doctor visit and prescription."}, {"comment_id": "eunep6n", "post_id": "cgy0b3", "comment": "What a coincidence that all these benefits are being discovered when cannabis is being legalized in many states in United States.

Infrequent users usually report that they have deep, restful sleep. Chronic users go either way.\n\nI believe a part of this comes from our own Endocannabinoid System (ECS) and how our bodies choose regulate the cannabinoids once they interact with our CB1 and CB2 receptors.  Alcohol doesn't work in the same way as cannabis as we are practically designed to intake cannabinoids and produce our own endocannabinoids. That's why I think alcohol doesn't help with sleeping.\n\nMany people use cannabis to help them get drowsy or to stay asleep by inhalation, sublingual drops or edibles.  I use all 3 methods because my insomnia is terrible. But chronic use of cannabis can actually interfere with circadian rhythms over time and decrease the quality of sleep. \n\nI take a tolerance break every year in order to cleanse my body of cannabinoids so that I can get back to a baseline. After the break I don't need to take as much via inhalation or eating and my sleep quality improves. I do notice the longer I go without a break my sleep does become disturbed though so I either need to stop or increase in my intake. \n\nCBN is a cannabinoid that is naturally occurring but most often is created by the degradation of THC. CBN is used to help sleep disorders and I can vouch that it is very effective especially when combined with CBD and THC.\n\nSince cannabis is still a Schedule 1 substance research has been hindered by the Feds.  As we see it become more socially accepted I believe it will become rescheduled, descheduled or outright Federally legal.

I've seen this before with the ideas of Cal Newport. While I don't totally discount the idea that working more in a particular subject enhances that subject to levels that can be considered passionate, I detest this sort of 'blank slate' thinking because I think the evidence suggests it's just flat-out wrong.\n\nThe idea that you can pick almost anything and become passionate about it is absurd for anyone with a degree of introspection and knowledge of psychological metrics. We know that metrics such as IQ, (for which genetics account for at least 60&#37; of the variance, and maybe as high as 80&#37;), absolutely limit the field of potential and available 'passions' one can pursue.  You can't progress or develop a growth mindset in your chosen 'passion' of physics if your IQ is 85, PERIOD.  Add into this the 'Big 5' metrics of personality which also appear to have a strong genetic component (upwards of 40&#37;), and an environmental component that is largely determined by the age of 5; and the field of 'passions' become more limited still.\n\nFood for thought on this point: twin studies have suggested that even career choices have some parameters which may be genetically influenced. While anecdotal, there have been cases of twins separated at birth actually making almost identical career choices; with similar temperaments, pursing identical hobbies, making similar incomes etc. \n\nOnce you add in the environmental forces that, beyond individual differences, carry you along in the ebb and flow of life, you severely limit your options as well. A cursory glance into the autobiographies of histories great scientists and artists tell the story of 'passions' that were pursued based on the available understanding of the world at the time, the level of wealth the family had, chance opportunities, and pressing questions within their respective fields of work.    \n\nI would also go on a limb to argue that cultural rewards also influence what 'passions' come to the surface.  I remember a time before 'big data' salaries. Now, in the past 6 years, there are so many people popping out of the woodwork 'passionate' about data science and coding, I can't believe it.  I wonder what would happen if you decrease those salaries to $50k a year...    \n\nThis is not to mention personal decisions that accumulate since birth - at age 25 you already have knowledge and capacity in some fields more than others, which further limit your solution space when trying to develop a given 'passion'.  The authors argue that this is wrong because it hampers a 'growth mindset' and decreases available options.  I argue that this is inevitable and it is damn near impossible to start as a 'blank slate' 25 years into a life, rewrite your psychometric traits, disregard the cultural influences and move forward;  growth mindset or not.\n\nWhen all is said and done, we are left with a limited 'bag' of interests from which to choose.  I think better advice is: through deep personal introspection, find that 'bag' of interests; find those 3-4 things you absolutely are WAY more interested in than anything else; measure the pros and cons of each in terms of stability, income etc.  and then pull the trigger with a 'growth mindset'.

Love, as a commitment device, might reduce interest in extrapair sex. Therefore, one can expect a negative association between measures of passion and sociosexual desire. Further, we wish to explore the effects of decoupling love and sex as measured by sociosexual attitudes on sexual frequency; as there might be a greater willingness to compromise on frequency of sex if sex is less related to expression of emotions and relational quality. We examined how men and women\u2019s sociosexuality, relationship length and various dimensions of relationship quality impact couples\u2019 intercourse frequency. Structural Equation Modeling analyses were performed on data from 92 romantically involved, heterosexual couples recruited at a Norwegian university. Participants\u2019 age ranged from 19 to 30 years. The current relationship length ranged from 1 month to 9 years (M = 21 months). Intercourse frequency decreased with increased length of relationship. Both men and women\u2019s ratings of relationship passion were strongly associated with frequency of having sex, but negatively associated with desire for extrapair sex. Intercourse was more frequent in couples where women reported less restricted attitudes, while men\u2019s level of sociosexuality had no effect on intercourse frequency in any of the models. These novel findings suggest that while men in general might desire sex more, in this sample from a highly egalitarian nation, men might be compromising more than women do.\n\n**Background: Why'd they do it?**\nThe researchers wanted to use a sociosexuality (def: preference for short-term sexual relations) inventory  to measure sexual drive and behavior within monogamous relationships. This is a novel approach, which they hoped would capture previous sexual behavior and extra-dyadic sexual attraction.\nSociosexuality also measures how comfortable one is with sexual behavior in the absence of love (ex. an exclusive hook-up partner). The researchers proposed that sociosexual attitudes might predict a willingness to compromise and engage in sexual activity more frequently than they would otherwise.\n\n**Methods (aka how they did it)**\nThe researchers collected data via self-report inventories (validated surveys) of romantic couples.\nThe data included sociosexuality (preference for short-term sexual relations), relationship quality (six sub-scales: satisfaction, commitment, intimacy, trust, love, and passion), and frequency of intercourse.\n\n**Results (what they found, why it matters)**\nThe frequency of intercourse in romantic couples is predicted by women's sociosexuality, and the passion sub-scale of the relationship quality inventory. Higher sociosexuality in women predicts higher frequency of intercourse, and higher passion in both men and women predicts higher frequency of intercourse.\n\nfrequently asked questions:\n  \nQ: How was passion defined?\nA: The researchers used the Perceived Relationship Quality Components Inventory. The passion dimension of this inventory is measured with questions such as \"How sexually intense is your relationship?\". This inventory is frequently used and has been validated multiple times.\n\nQ: So men have higher libido than women?  \nA: Yes, although the differences may be due to societal and cultural factors rather than biological differences.\n\nQ: this is a correlation, not a causation!  \nA: Yes, you're right! The researchers address this in the study. If you can propose an ethical experimental study on this topic of similar quality, the researchers would love to hear from you."}, {"comment_id": "enrgz1r", "post_id": "bpaxoj", "comment": ">The study included 92 couples aged 19 to 30\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnyone know why that was the age range they decided on?

An initial screening of different species of fungi has been conducted. Fungal growth medium was overlaid onto cured concrete plate. Mycelial discs were aseptically deposited at the plate center. The results showed that, due to the dissolving of Ca(OH)2 from concrete, the pH of the growth medium increased from its original value of 6.5 to 13.0. Despite the drastic pH increase, Trichoderma reesei (ATCC13631) spores germinated into hyphal mycelium and grew equally well with or without concrete. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM) confirmed that the crystals precipitated on the fungal hyphae were composed of calcite.

In the last four years, over 250 provisions aimed at restricting access to abortion have been adopted. Publicly funded family planning clinics provide low-cost and free contraception to nearly 1.5 million teens each year. In recent years, several states have considered legislation to defund family planning services, although little is known about how these cuts affect teen pregnancy. This paper fills this knowledge gap by exploiting a policy change in Texas that reduced funding for family planning services by 67 percent and resulted in over 80 clinic closures. I estimate the effects of the funding cuts on teen health outcomes using a difference-in-differences approach that compares the changes in teen birth rates in Texas counties that lost family planning funding to changes in counties outside of Texas with publicly funded clinics. I find that reducing funding for family planning services in Texas increased teen birth rates by approximately 3.4 percent over four years with effects concentrated 2-3 years after the initial cuts.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dlc7yet", "post_id": "6se104", "comment": "Did anyone bother reading the study?

Both of these effects were sustained for at least three months.

We asked Americans to nominate America's greatest year, their personal greatest year, and to explain why they nominated those years. Americans could not agree on America's greatest year. Instead, some Americans nominated years when nationally relevant events occurred, such as 1776 and 1945. Others nominated years when they were between 0 and 20 years old; people nominated a similar pattern of years when asked the year they were at their personal greatest. Our findings establish, for the first time, a set of memories for the events that shape America's identity. Our findings also add to the literature on the reminiscence bump, showing that decisions about America's greatest time and one's personal greatest time are most likely to occur during one's youth."}, {"comment_id": "dp6p4tz", "post_id": "7a2pmo", "comment": "I wonder if this will still hold up?

Does anyone have this data?\n3) I don\u2019t really consider opportunities  to become mega rich through tech as a core factor for the question I posed, and is more of a distraction.

Originally all students at a school were permitted to legally purchase marijuana. At some point this was changed so that foreign students were not allowed, but local ones were. This allows the researchers to compare the difference in grades from before and after for local students against the difference in grades for foreign ones (hence, difference-in-differences). \n\nNote that this means that this is explicitly NOT a result saying that people who smoke weed do worse. The population for each group is (hopefully) roughly the same before and after the intervention. This is instead evidence that, *on average*, when college students' legal access to marijuana *is cut off*, they do better in school. Because of the natural experiment setup, this is not just a correlational result; it actually does provide causal evidence for its conclusion, though how strong you think that evidence is depends on how compelling you find the paper.\n\nRemember that when using this kind of non-experimental data there are always criticisms that can be made against the setup and experiment.

A non-peer reviewed blog?  \n\nThis blog does not appear to have a clear methodology in selecting who is a contrarian.  For example, I looked up one such \"contrarian\", [Richard Tol](https://www.desmogblog.com/richard-tol)\n\n>Tol has been involved in writing United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports in various capacities as an author (contributing, lead, principal, and convening) for the working groups looking at the physical science, the impacts and the ways to mitigate climate change. . . . Since about June 2013, Tol has been engaged in a public fight with the authors of a popular scientific journal paper which found that 97 per cent of climate change studies carried out since 1991 agreed that global warming was mostly caused by human activity.  Tol nevertheless agrees a scientific consensus on global warming exists, but argues over the methodology used to arrive at the 97% figure. . .. Richard Tol was listed among \u201cKey Scientists\u201d appearing in Marc Morano's movie, Climate Hustle...  **Bill Nye** described it as \u201cnot in our national interest and the world\u2019s interest.\u201d \n\nYou can write IPCC reports, yet disagreeing with the methodology of one paper makes you a contrarian?  Bill Nye speaking out against you makes you a contrarian?  And this paper uses *that*?\n\nLater, in page 12 of the supplementary information\n\n>Supplementary Figure 1b shows the 100 most-cited CCS, ranked according to the citation tally  calculated by taking the linear sum  across the set of papers corresponding to a given researcher name, indexed here by . Again, since we are mainly concerned with identifying a comparable set of 386 prominent CCS, we are not concerned with accounting for publication team size, author order, or other credit attribution factors. Instead we opt for a straightforward definition for the citation impact measure . We also noted several top-cited researcher profiles belonging to the CCC list: R. Bradley, J. Clark, J. Curry, C. Johnson, R. Pielke, J. Taylor, and R. Tol; these individuals were summarily kept within the CCC group, *and their places within the 386 CCS list were replaced* with the next highest-cited researcher profile.\n\nIn short, they created a list of 100 most cited climate scientists.  Then hand-picked 7 of these as being \"contrarian\", and simply replaced them out of the list.  No methodology or reasoning is given why these 7 are contrarian, they publish heavily and are cited heavily, yet they were simply...dropped because they are in the wrong \"team\"?  \n\n>All together, we constructed a list of 386 prominent contrarians, comprised of academics, scientists, politicians, and business people who are primarily anglophone [Then later]  We then collected \u223c200,000 CC research articles from the WOS database, from which we selected the 386 highest cited scientists (denoted by CCSs). \n\nThis is category mistake.   One list has politicians and policy makers, the other does not.  For example, Rick Perry, Mike Pence, and Scott Pruitt are listed as contrarians.  The other side only includes scientists.  \n\nSo for example, if a media piece quotes both Mike Pence and Al Gore on the politics of climate science, this paper's methodology increases the media's contrarian coverage measurement.  In other words, Mike Pence increases the measurement while Al Gore is ignored entirely. \n\nI would have much preferred a scientist-to-scientist apples vs apples comparison, but that didn't happen."}, {"comment_id": "ewwo2ez", "post_id": "cqfep6", "comment": "As long as we remember that science isn't a matter of consensus, but of predictive success."}, {"comment_id": "ewvx9u7", "post_id": "cqfep6", "comment": "Because \"boring\" explanation of what is happening ain't going to attract attention (and money) than presenting nutjobs, militant idiots and what not else"}, {"comment_id": "ewwcqyv", "post_id": "cqfep6", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ewwo7ui", "post_id": "cqfep6", "comment": "What is shocking is how many folks still think the media is dedicated to keeping an informed populace ...."}, {"comment_id": "ewwyzr7", "post_id": "cqfep6", "comment": "I left the climate science research and swapped from Biogeophysics to Computational Biology because of sensationalized political BS.

I *HAVE* to claim it is 100% or near 100% man-made lest I receive a \"label\" of being a *denier* or an out-casted skeptic?\n\nI was studying the gas exchange of microbes in various soils in various climates, be it times of drought or other various factors and you know what?

I am firmly in the belief that there is natural climate drift occurring and there is *ALSO* man-made climate change contributions as well and I want to know to what extent.

I will straight-up tell people that it is likely both, and it seems likely we are contributing to it at higher rate than natural drift as well, given some recent trends of the last century, but hell, the Earth has been warming since the last ice age, with various cycles of cooling and warming, so the question I want to answer is how much of that is natural and how much of that warming *now* is man-made. Maybe it's 90% man-made, maybe 75/25, maybe something else. Hell, maybe it IS 99% - there's a hell of a lot of research in an attempt to answer these questions.

The results showed that in early adolescence, and prior to initiation to CU, poor short-term and working memory, but high verbal IQ, were associated with earlier age of onset of CU. In turn, age of CU onset and CU frequency across adolescence were associated with (a) specific neurocognitive decline in verbal IQ and executive function tasks tapping trial and error learning and reward processing by early adulthood and (b) lower rates of high-school graduation. The association between CU onset and change in neurocognitive function, however, was found to be accounted for by CU frequency. Whereas the link between CU frequency across adolescence and change in verbal IQ was explained (mediated) by high school graduation, the link between CU frequency and tasks tapping trial and error learning were independent from high school graduation, concurrent cannabis and other substance use, adolescent alcohol use, and externalizing behaviors. Findings support prevention efforts aimed at delaying onset and reducing frequency of CU."}, {"comment_id": "dcz7kbv", "post_id": "5qh64v", "comment": "There are studies that also show holding off trying this until your mid twenties can lower the risk of addiction or at least continuous use."}, {"comment_id": "dcz91c8", "post_id": "5qh64v", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dcz7vbc", "post_id": "5qh64v", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dcz924b", "post_id": "5qh64v", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dczaga0", "post_id": "5qh64v", "comment": "Careful with the interpretation!\n\nWe actually study this in my lab.

I believe in climate change. I believe it is mostly caused by man and has the potential to be catastrophic. However, I don't see anyone from the left or right taking an honest approach to solve this problem. \n\nThe first main thing that no one talks about is nuclear. It supplies 20% of US energy right now. After all the government programs and huge pushes from organizations, where are renewables? 15%? Now, the first problem is that we aren't expanding nuclear. I have found no legitimate reason why nuclear shouldn't be pursued as a reasonable answer to fight climate change. Unsafe? False. Run out of uranium? False. The main argument I keep hearing is the same crap one I heard from Bill Nye on his new show - people dont want it. Well guess what, make people want it. We've spent so much forcing premature green energy into the market, I think we can afford a little education on an existing solution to this nightmare. \n\nAnother part of this that no one wants to address is that if we don't persue nuclear, it doesn't just stay there. We've stopped making plants, and all existing ones are getting old, which means that 20% will be rapidly declining to 0 in the next 10-20 years. And what will fill that strong base load? Sorry to say it will definitely not be green. So.trying our best to push green energy, there will be a net loss as long we keep this up. \n\nLastly, if we do want to make green energy work, prematurely forcing it into the market is costing us billions. Billions that should be spent on R&D. When it becomes economically viable and competitive, then go to market. And it will thrive.\n\nOverall, I am happy with Trump's decision to pull out of this agreement.

Anyone with an iota of critical reasoning should be able to look at the myriad of peer reviewed papers and interviews with credentialed experts on the subject, and logically come to the conclusion that this is an enormous problem that can only be tackled effectively on a global scale.\n\nHOWEVER... the Paris Agreements are:\n\nA) ineffective (allowing countries to tailor reduction goals in any way they seem fit)\n\nB) toothless (no punishments for missing targets; \"peer pressure\" is how some of the developed world expects to ensure emerging markets keep their end of the bargain)\n\nC) expensive ($100 billion a year minimum, from wealthy developed nations to emerging economies, in order to offset the cost of using more expensive \"green\" technology)\n\n**NOTE: Depending on which article you read, the $100 billion dollar figure is either a yearly total paid by all the big developed countries... or the figure to be contributed yearly just by us in the USA. To date, we have pledged around 30% of the total funds for the United Nations Green Climate Fund ($3 billion from us, $7 billion from 42 other countries, for a little over $10 billion total). So I think it's fair to say that the amount would've been between $30 and $100 billion yearly from the US to other countries**\n\nThat's a lot of money to give away to other nations with no guarantees that they will follow through on their end, especially since the recipients include our economic competitors such as China and India. For comparison's sake, $30 billion is the amount America spends yearly on humanitarian aid throughout the world. This money could definitely yield better short term results if pumped into similar programs (clean water/combating AIDS or other diseases/lessening poverty), whether domestic or abroad. \n\nOn the other hand, the US spends almost $4 trillion dollars a year; this is a small percentage to pay for us to combat such a large scale problem... especially when we know we'll be seeing multi-trillion dollar economic reductions once it starts to get real bad in the 2080's and the 2090's. \n\nPersonally, I think the Paris Agreement was nothing more than political grandstanding, a proverbial pat on the back for all the world leaders. \"We did something about climate change, yay!\" I understand that it's hard to get almost 200 countries to agree on something, but the current language is so weak that it is practically useless. As Americans, what we need to do is push our elected officials to come up with a legitimate and detailed plan that actually spells out the monetary costs associated and the targets that must be met. It really doesn't have to be so expansive in number of countries - if we could get China, India, Pakistan, and the EU on board, we'd have the majority of the world's greenhouse gas emitters right there with us. Then we could use \"peer pressure\" to convince the smaller ones left. It is a much more rational and substantive way forward. \n\nNow, is the current administration going to lead the way forward with this? Almost certainly not.

The structure of some, but not all, music preferences factors aligned with previous reports. Overall, maladaptive traits had meaningful, albeit modest links to entertainment media preferences, but not to the kinds of intense or rebellious music genres sometimes labeled as \u201cproblem\u201d entertainment in prior literature. Support emerged for several a priori hypotheses, but some predictions based on the three- and five-factor normal personality trait and entertainment preferences literature did not generalize to a five-factor formulation of maladaptive personality.

To systematically identify small proteins, we carried out a comparative genomics study on 1,773 human-associated metagenomes from four different body sites. We describe >4,000 conserved protein families, the majority of which are novel; \u223c30% of these protein families are predicted to be secreted or transmembrane. Over 90% of the small protein families have no known domain and almost half are not represented in reference genomes. We identify putative housekeeping, mammalian-specific, defense-related, and protein families that are likely to be horizontally transferred. We provide evidence of transcription and translation for a subset of these families. Our study suggests that small proteins are highly abundant and those of the human microbiome, in particular, may perform diverse functions that have not been previously reported."}, {"comment_id": "ewlo7vg", "post_id": "covfi5", "comment": "Could this lead to understanding Crohn\u2019s disease better?"}, {"comment_id": "ewlq59i", "post_id": "covfi5", "comment": "I heard that once the gut biome is compromised by unhealthy bacteria, it's almost impossible to ge tit back to normal.

For the SNPs taken together, we found evidence of heterogeneous effects across environments. The SNPs implicate genes involved in brain-development processes and neuron-to-neuron communication. In a separate analysis of the X chromosome, we identify 10\u2009independent genome-wide-significant SNPs and estimate a SNP heritability of around 0.3% in both men and women, consistent with partial dosage compensation. A joint (multi-phenotype) analysis of educational attainment and three related cognitive phenotypes generates polygenic scores that explain 11\u201313% of the variance in educational attainment and 7\u201310% of the variance in cognitive performance.

North American extravertive behaviour patterns are not the \"default\" or \"normal\" way of extravertive behaviour (Even french introverts kiss their relatives on both cheeks while the most outgoing japanese person would be a little disturbed by that) but the whole article uses examples tailored around that point of view. \n\n>  the ideal person in the \u201cindividualistic West\u201d is \u201cautonomous, expressive, and comfortable in the spotlight\u201d (p. 2). \n\nsave for the \"comfortable in the spotlight\" part introverted people are perfectly autonomous and they can easily be expressive. Introversion does not necessarily mean people don't express their feelings or individuality - not speaking when you don't feel like you have anything to say is an expression of feeling in of itself and it's not right to talk about introverts being quiet in public as a perpetual state of \"wanting so say something\". They are not autists with social deficiencies. \n\nOne one hand I'm perfectly okay with the conclusion that \"being yourself\" will lead to more happiness and increase your chances of social acceptance but on the other I think the author fails to show that introverts already possess many of the qualities valued in modern society and tend to sabotage themselves with anxieties from aspiring to behaviour they experience as unpleasant *because*, like the author, confuse being socially able with being extraverted.  \n "}, {"comment_id": "eb7mzia", "post_id": "a3nlk3", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eb7n2pm", "post_id": "a3nlk3", "comment": "Please define : **Introverts**"}, {"comment_id": "eb7ti4z", "post_id": "a3nlk3", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eb7lzg5", "post_id": "a3nlk3", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eb836cq", "post_id": "a3nlk3", "comment": "Financial success, at least in the US, really is more about who you know than what you know, and that kind of sucks when you have a natural aversion to talking to people.

These extraverted attributes are socially desirable in individualistic Western cultures, and some evidence suggests that extraverts experience better person-environment fit and greater well-being than introverts in these cultures. However, what remains unclear is how living in a context that values and emphasises extraversion may impact upon the well-being of introverts, and how introverts might improve their well-being. This study aimed to explore this question via a moderated mediation model. Adult participants in Australia (N\u2009=\u2009349) completed scales of trait introversion\u2013extraversion, dispositional authenticity, and well-being. The extent to which participants wanted to be more extraverted than they were currently\u2014labelled an extraversion-deficit belief\u2014was also measured. Participants overwhelmingly indicated that they lived in a society where extraversion was more socially desirable than introversion, and most participants held extraversion-deficit beliefs. Moderated mediation analysis showed that higher trait introversion\u2013extraversion predicted well-being directly as well as indirectly via dispositional authenticity, but this indirect pathway depended on extraversion-deficit beliefs. Extraversion-deficit beliefs were more important for the authenticity and well-being of introverts than for extraverts. Overall, we interpret our findings to mean that introverts in the West might be more authentic, and hence boost their overall well-being, if they can change their beliefs to become more accepting of their introversion."}, {"comment_id": "eb7qwvj", "post_id": "a3nlk3", "comment": "Problem is it's very hard to accept yourself when you feel like no one else does.

We investigate a novel approach to solve this problem by creating a hybrid of colocated agriculture and solar photovoltaic (PV) infrastructure. We take an integrative approach\u2014monitoring microclimatic conditions, PV panel temperature, soil moisture and irrigation water use, plant ecophysiological function and plant biomass production within this \u2018agrivoltaics\u2019 ecosystem and in traditional PV installations and agricultural settings to quantify trade-offs. We find that shading by the PV panels provides multiple additive and synergistic benefits, including reduced plant drought stress, greater food production and reduced PV panel heat stress.

The first nine patients received intravesical administration of monotherapy CAVATAK; in the second stage, six patients received CAVATAK with a sub-therapeutic dose of mitomycinC, known to enhance expression of ICAM-1 on bladder cancer cells. The primary endpoint was to determine patient safety and maximum tolerated dose. Secondary endpoints were evidence of viral replication, induction of inflammatory cytokines, anti-tumour activity and viral-induced changes in resected tissue. \n\nResults: \n\nClinical activity of CAVATAK was demonstrated by induction of tumour inflammation and haemorrhage following either single or multiple administrations of CAVATAK in multiple patients, and a complete resolution of tumour in one patient. Whether used alone or in combination with mitomycinC, CAVATAK caused marked inflammatory changes within NMIBC tissue biopsies by up-regulating interferon-inducible genes including both immune checkpoint-inhibitory genes (PD-L1 and LAG3) and Th1-associated chemokines as well as induction of the innate activator RIG-I, compared to bladder cancer tissue from untreated patients. No significant toxicities were reported in any patient, from either virus or combination therapy. \n\nConclusions: \n\nThe acceptable safety profile of CAVATAK, proof of viral targeting, replication and tumour cell death together with the virus-mediated increases in \"immunological heat\" within the tumour microenvironment all indicate that CAVATAK may be potentially considered as a novel therapeutic for NMIBC."}, {"comment_id": "esxquxi", "post_id": "c9f8rn", "comment": "Actually, there is already a method using BCG vaccine(a vaccine for TB) to treat bladder cancer, which is attenuated(\u201cliving\u201d) vaccine.

To do so, we conducted a field experiment on Tinder in which we collected data on 3,600 profile evaluations. In line with previous research on mating preferences from multiple fields, our results indicate a heterogeneous effect of education level by gender: while women strongly prefer a highly educated potential partner, this hypothesis is rejected for men. In contrast with recent influential studies from the field of economics, we do not find any evidence that men would have an aversion to a highly educated potential partner. Additionally, in contrast with most previous research \u2013 again from multiple fields \u2013 we do not find any evidence for preferences for educational assortative mating, i.e. preferring a partner with a similar education level."}, {"comment_id": "ew3r84c", "post_id": "cmosn6", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ew3xke8", "post_id": "cmosn6", "comment": "> The researchers created 24 fake male and female Tinder profiles located in several cities in Flanders, the Dutch-speaking region of Belgium.

I'm an economist although not in this area and my opinion is that they probably tacked on the return to education component late in the writing process to appeal to this specific journal. It's not a very highly ranked one, so that's why the link to returns to education doesn't need to be that strong. Better papers in this area would have bigger experiments with more interesting results, or would develop a new theoretical model for matching.

One of the biggest takeaways I got from my training there is that we MUST talk about suicide. Bring it out of the shadows and take away the taboo. We can't be afraid to ask people if they want to kill themselves, and we must be willing to ask them, point blank, \"Are you thinking of suicide? Are you thinking of killing yourself?\"    \nI don't agree with school administrators, policy makers, or entertainment watchdogs that are calling for the show to be banned, and to forbid kids from watching it. What I DO think, is that kids should not watch this show on their own, that they should be watching it with a trusted adult who will talk candidly with them about the events in the show. It should be a tool for communication wherein both kids and adults can ask questions and talk openly about suicide.    \nYes, I would say that the show dramatizes and even romanticizes suicide in a way, but it IS a television show after all. There is also some very graphic rapes scenes in the show, perpetrated by a popular character who seemingly gets away with it; is this likely to increase the number of rapes if kids think they can get away with it because they saw it on a show? I think not. But that is all the more reason to talk with kids about what is real and what is fantasy in regards to suicide.    \nIf we start banning TV shows and forbidding kids from watching them on the grounds that they are controversial, you know that is likely to just make them want to watch it more and they will hunt it down, stream it, download it, and watch it secretly, without the opportunity to talk to anyone about what they see for fear of getting in trouble, and because that's just what kids do. What will we do next? Ban them from watching the news when one of their favourite singers or actors commits suicide? Someone who seemly has everything: fame, money, prestige, but still decides to kill themselves, because we are afraid that it will cause kids to kill themselves?    \nThe whole argument that people are influenced by what they watch, and that kids who watch shows about suicide will be influenced to kill themselves, is no different than the argument people have made in the past that playing violent video games makes people violent, or that listening to Eminem makes people misogynistic.     \nPeople that kill themselves or engage in other acts of self-harm likely already had those thoughts. Watching a TV show won't make them do something they hadn't already decided to do; however, people are more likely to commit suicide following the suicide of someone they were close to or idolized. It makes me wonder if anyone had looked into the increase of internet searches on suicide after the death of Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington, or Robin Williams? No one seems to be concerned with suicide epidemics among at risk youth in poor neighbourhoods or isolated communities like what is happening with First Nations kids, who are killing themselves in droves.    \nSuicide should not be a taboo topic. We should all be talking about it. The conversation has started because of this show, but the focus is all wrong. Instead of worrying so much about a TV show supposedly increasing the number of internet searches on how to kill oneself, maybe we should be talking about WHY kids feel like suicide is the answer.

That show broke every single rule about how to talk about suicide. It sort of gave a half baked effort at showing how suicide is bad, but then it went on to glorify suicide in every way possible.

Teens don't understand yet that death is permanent and this show reinforces that. \n\n2. It put ALL the blame on the bullies. Counselors everywhere stress taking control of your own life, your own emotions, and your own reactions to other people, and this show does its darnedest to unravel any idea of personal agency. It shows that the girl that committed suicide was a complete victim and suicide was her only option, which is exactly the opposite of what you should do if you want people to avoid suicide. \n\n3. It shows that the girl who committed suicide got literally everything she wanted. Attention from everyone in the school, all the bullies feeling bad, and even her crush falling in love with her after the fact because of the tapes she made.\n\n4. It shows the actual gruesome way she committed suicide, giving everyone who was wondering how to do it step-by-step directions.\n\nAnd those are just a few.

This is very difficult in cancer because all of the proteins are self proteins. Now, the model this group used has cancer cells genetically modified to include the protein Ova, which is ovalbumin (major egg protein, and what most people are allergic to when they are allergic to eggs). The thing with Ova is that it is a GREAT antigen, and vaccine responses against Ova are always excellent . So they are using it as a model system to show how much better this adjuvant is, which is great, but this in its current formulation is curing no one. These steps are super important, so I don't want to take away from the actual study, which is a good study.

One of its main components, microplastics, has been found in several sea salt samples from different countries, indicating that sea products are irremediably contaminated by microplastics. Previous studies show very confusing results, reporting amounts of microparticles (MPs) in salt ranging from zero to 680\u2009MPs/kg, with no mention of the possible causes of such differences. Several errors in the experimental procedures used were found and are reported in the present work. Likewise, 21 different samples of commercial table salt from Spain have been analyzed for MPs content and nature. The samples comprise sea salts and well salts, before and after packing. The microplastic content found was of 50\u2013280\u2009MPs/kg salt, being polyethylene-terephthalate (PET) the most frequently found polymer, followed by polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE), with no significant differences among all the samples. The results indicate that even though the micro-particles might originate from multiple sources, there is a background presence of microplastics in the environment.\n\nJournal Reference 2:\n\nThe presence of microplastics in commercial salts from different countries\n\nAli Karami, Abolfazl Golieskardi, Cheng Keong Choo, Vincent Larat, Tamara S. Galloway & Babak Salamatinia\n\nScientific Reports 7, Article number: 46173 (2017)\n\ndoi:10.1038/srep46173\n\nPublished online: 06 April 2017\n\nLink: https://www.nature.com/articles/srep46173\n\nAbstract\n\n> The occurrence of microplastics (MPs) in saltwater bodies is relatively well studied, but nothing is known about their presence in most of the commercial salts that are widely consumed by humans across the globe. Here, we extracted MP-like particles larger than 149\u2009\u03bcm from 17 salt brands originating from 8 different countries followed by the identification of their polymer composition using micro-Raman spectroscopy. Microplastics were absent in one brand while others contained between 1 to 10\u2009MPs/Kg of salt. Out of the 72 extracted particles, 41.6% were plastic polymers, 23.6% were pigments, 5.50% were amorphous carbon, and 29.1% remained unidentified. The particle size (mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD) was 515\u2009\u00b1\u2009171\u2009\u03bcm. The most common plastic polymers were polypropylene (40.0%) and polyethylene (33.3%). Fragments were the primary form of MPs (63.8%) followed by filaments (25.6%) and films (10.6%). According to our results, the low level of anthropogenic particles intake from the salts (maximum 37 particles per individual per annum) warrants negligible health impacts. However, to better understand the health risks associated with salt consumption, further development in extraction protocols are needed to isolate anthropogenic particles smaller than 149\u2009\u03bcm."}, {"comment_id": "dmrw155", "post_id": "6z1866", "comment": "It is bad.

Heres the closest ELI5 I can come up with to explain some of the matters at play here:\n\nThe US healthcare system has, for a very long time, been based on \"fee for service\" - you get an Xray, you pay for the Xray (oversimplifying but you get it). Well thats great and all but as you might imagine it:\n\n1. Doesn't incentivize good OUTCOMES, one in which the patient gets better and not hot-potatoed around to other specialists for more \"services\".\n2. Can easily be manipulated to bill for unneccesary procedures etc\n\nDuring this fee for service period Doctors would get reimbursed for these services and depending on your insurance type, they might get very \"little\" versus what Medicaid and other insurance companies are keeping. Over the past couple years there has been a shift to \"Value Based Care\" and as the name implies, doctors would get incentivized to produce results ie. patients dont keep coming back and they get better.\n\nGreat, all is fine and dandy right? Not quite. Documentation of the entire patient encounter has always occurred (thats why you have charts) and that dictated the reimbursement levels a doctor would receive. Now this need to document is accentuated as we shift to the new Value Based initiative. This coupled with the fact that documentation has become electronic, aka on computers (programs are called EMR/EHRs), has put a serious amount of stress on providers to not only provide Care but document appropriately, resulting in doctors either:\n\n1. Documenting in the room while seeing you - resulting in lower pt satisfaction, which is another factor that I wont dive too deep into.\n2. Wait to document until after patient visits or at the end of the day, potentially missing information (as well reimbursement bc doctors tend to underchart to avoid legal action) There is a shocking amount of providers staying hours on end just to  finish and wrap up after a 10 hour day, some even charting on the weekends. You have to remember these are CLINICAL professionals not CLERICAL and even the best typists are having trouble keeping up as reimbursements continuously decline\n\nOR\n\nDont document much the day of the encounter and letting it pile up, losing reimbursement as well important details about the encounter, so its a lose lose for both the patient and provider (as well the practice waiting to get paid)\n\nThis is just 1 major aspect affecting their work-life balance but its played a vital role over the last few years as we continuously change healthcare policy (what needs to be charted, for those in the field I know how much you love MACRA/MIPS and MU.)\n\nI can go on and on but i'm typing this from a phone.

I found a link to the primary manuscript and found the \u2018commentary\u2019 to be well written but without any newly generated data. The nuances of burnout are well defined and supported by studies from different periods. What I hoped for, primary research over a decade with supporting data on physician burnout certainly was not a component of this article. Instead the data seemed to support the authors\u2019 opinions. \n\nWhat do I think?  Well, yes the electronic health record (EHR) detracts from the doctor/patient relationship but we needed something that improved documentation and, hopefully, improved value based care. So I suffer through the EHR and keep my fingers crossed that it will make the advances promised years ago. So far, the cost of care has only increased with the EHR adding to these costs.  \n\nInsurance companies are extraordinarily challenging to negotiate and when you consider some with \u2018not for profit\u2019 status and executives who earn millions, the hope is that new models will replace at least some of the insurers. The current availability of Medicaid, Medicare, and private insurance could be revamped to support better options for each although many hospitals and doctors require some percentage of the higher paying insured patients to survive. This challenge is not new, in medical school I had a family medicine physician tell me that he had not made an income from his practice in years but he enjoyed the work and wanted to keep his staff employed. He also retired that year. \n\nIn my practice and at my hospital I do not see the high burnout that was described in the article. Medicine is hard work, so are law, accounting, retail, and most jobs.

However, the causality and direction of this association are not clear; physical activity may protect against depression, and/or depression may result in decreased physical activity.\n\n**Objective:**  To examine bidirectional relationships between physical activity and depression using a genetically informed method for assessing potential causal inference.\n\n**Design, Setting, and Participants:**  This 2-sample mendelian randomization (MR) used independent top genetic variants associated with 2 physical activity phenotypes\u2014self-reported (n\u2009=\u2009377\u202f234) and objective accelerometer-based (n\u2009=\u200991\u202f084)\u2014and with major depressive disorder (MDD) (n\u2009=\u2009143\u202f265) as genetic instruments from the largest available, nonoverlapping genome-wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS were previously conducted in diverse observational cohorts, including the UK Biobank (for physical activity) and participating studies in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (for MDD) among adults of European ancestry. Mendelian randomization estimates from each genetic instrument were combined using inverse variance weighted meta-analysis, with alternate methods (eg, weighted median, MR Egger, MR\u2013Pleiotropy Residual Sum and Outlier \\[PRESSO\\]) and multiple sensitivity analyses to assess horizontal pleiotropy and remove outliers. Data were analyzed from May 10 through July 31, 2018.\n\n**Main Outcomes and Measures:** MDD and physical activity.\n\n**Results:**  GWAS summary data were available for a combined sample size of 611\u202f583 adult participants. Mendelian randomization evidence suggested a protective relationship between accelerometer-based activity and MDD (odds ratio \\[OR\\],\u20090.74 for MDD per 1-SD increase in mean acceleration; 95% CI, 0.59-0.92; P\u2009=\u2009.006). In contrast, there was no statistically significant relationship between MDD and accelerometer-based activity (\u03b2\u2009=\u2009\u22120.08 in mean acceleration per MDD vs control status; 95% CI, \u22120.47 to 0.32; P\u2009=\u2009.70). Furthermore, there was no significant relationship between self-reported activity and MDD (OR, 1.28 for MDD per 1-SD increase in metabolic-equivalent minutes of reported moderate-to-vigorous activity; 95% CI, 0.57-3.37; P\u2009=\u2009.48), or between MDD and self-reported activity (\u03b2\u2009=\u20090.02 per MDD in standardized metabolic-equivalent minutes of reported moderate-to-vigorous activity per MDD vs control status; 95% CI, \u22120.008 to 0.05; P\u2009=\u2009.15).\n\n**Conclusions and Relevance:**  Using genetic instruments identified from large-scale GWAS, robust evidence supports a protective relationship between objectively assessed\u2014but not self-reported\u2014physical activity and the risk for MDD. Findings point to the importance of objective measurement of physical activity in epidemiologic studies of mental health and support the hypothesis that enhancing physical activity may be an effective prevention strategy for depression."}, {"comment_id": "eet8s5o", "post_id": "aj5zy2", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eet4gd8", "post_id": "aj5zy2", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eet4qzu", "post_id": "aj5zy2", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "eet5zj2", "post_id": "aj5zy2", "comment": "Is there a difference between prevents depression and cures depression?

Lack of sleep is a predictor of a number of consequences, including issues at school such as sleepiness and tardiness. Considering the severity of this public health issue, it is essential to understand more about the factors that may compromise children's and adolescents' sleep. This meta-analysis examined the effects of school start time (SST) on sleep duration of students by aggregating the results of 5 longitudinal studies and 15 cross-sectional comparison group studies. Results indicated that later starting school times are associated with longer sleep durations. Additionally, later start times were associated with less daytime sleepiness (7 studies) and tardiness to school (3 studies). However, methodological considerations, such as a need for more longitudinal primary research, lead to a cautious interpretation. Overall, this systematic analysis of SST studies suggests that delaying SST is associated with benefits for students' sleep and, thus, their general well-being."}, {"comment_id": "dntrdvb", "post_id": "73vs49", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dntp5u2", "post_id": "73vs49", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dntssic", "post_id": "73vs49", "comment": "The reality is that the times probably won't change due to county budgeting.

Neuropathological evaluations and retrospective telephone clinical assessments (including head trauma history) with informants were performed blinded. Online questionnaires ascertained athletic and military history.\n\n**Exposures**  Participation in American football at any level of play.\n\n**Main Outcomes and Measures**  Neuropathological diagnoses of neurodegenerative diseases, including CTE, based on defined diagnostic criteria; CTE neuropathological severity (stages I to IV or dichotomized into mild [stages I and II] and severe [stages III and IV]); informant-reported athletic history and, for players who died in 2014 or later, clinical presentation, including behavior, mood, and cognitive symptoms and dementia.\n\n**Results**  Among 202 deceased former football players (median age at death, 66 years [interquartile range, 47-76 years]), CTE was neuropathologically diagnosed in 177 players (87%; median age at death, 67 years [interquartile range, 52-77 years]; mean years of football participation, 15.1 [SD, 5.2]), including 0 of 2 pre\u2013high school, 3 of 14 high school (21%), 48 of 53 college (91%), 9 of 14 semiprofessional (64%), 7 of 8 Canadian Football League (88%), and 110 of 111 National Football League (99%) players.

Among 27 participants with mild CTE pathology, 26 (96%) had behavioral or mood symptoms or both, 23 (85%) had cognitive symptoms, and 9 (33%) had signs of dementia.

In a novel attempt to address this issue, we designed a psychological intervention in the form of an online browser game. In the game, players take on the role of a fake news producer and learn to master six documented techniques commonly used in the production of misinformation: polarisation, invoking emotions, spreading conspiracy theories, trolling people online, deflecting blame, and impersonating fake accounts. The game draws on an inoculation metaphor, where preemptively exposing, warning, and familiarising people with the strategies used in the production of fake news helps confer cognitive immunity when exposed to real misinformation. We conducted a large-scale evaluation of the game with N\u2009=\u200915,000 participants in a pre-post gameplay design. We provide initial evidence that people\u2019s ability to spot and resist misinformation improves after gameplay, irrespective of education, age, political ideology, and cognitive style."}, {"comment_id": "es3d2g0", "post_id": "c5ptfz", "comment": "I'm honestly amazed that critical appraisal of information isn't taught more in schools.

Here, following extensive data collection efforts, we present an update of the current scope, amount and analysis of the level of subsidisation of the fisheries sector worldwide. We estimate global fisheries subsidies at USD 35.4 billion in 2018, of which capacity-enhancing subsidies are USD 22.2 billion. The top five subsidising political entities (China, European Union, USA, Republic of Korea and Japan) contribute 58% (USD 20.5 billion) of the total estimated subsidy. The updated global figure has decreased since the most recent previous estimate from 2009, of USD 41.4 billion in 2018 constant dollars. The difference between these two estimates can be largely explained by improvements in methodology and the difference in the actual amount of subsidies provided. Thus, we consider direct statistical comparison of these numbers to be inappropriate. Having said that, the difference between the estimates suggest that the increase in fisheries subsidies provided in the preceding decades may have halted. Still, the bulk of harmful \u2018capacity-enhancing\u2019 subsidies, particularly those for fossil fuels have actually increased as a proportion of total subsidies. As such, for the benefit of marine ecosystems, and current and future generations of people, all hands must be on deck in helping the WTO reach a meaningful agreement to discipline subsidies that lead to overcapacity and overfishing."}, {"comment_id": "f39a5ze", "post_id": "dg405h", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "f38uo9l", "post_id": "dg405h", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "f397wci", "post_id": "dg405h", "comment": "When the ocean's collapse a significant proportion of the worlds population will lose a primary source of protein, it won't be good"}, {"comment_id": "f399oa1", "post_id": "dg405h", "comment": "It seems like a promise to stop is a statement to some of their citizens of \"we need you to stop eating / earning a living.\" It is unsurprising that such a commitment is difficult to impossible to stick to.

What is unclear, however, is what issues happy couples face and how these issues may be different for couples depending on their developmental stage. To explore this possibility, the current study used both self\u2010reports and observations drawn from two separate samples of happily married couples\u2014one early in middle adulthood (N = 57 couples; average marital duration = 9 years) and one in older adulthood (N = 64 couples; average marital duration = 42 years). Results indicated that all issues were relatively minor, but early middle\u2010aged couples reported more significant problems than did older couples. As to determining the most salient topic for happy couples, it depended on the spouses\u2019 gender, developmental stage, and how salience was assessed (i.e., highest rated issue vs. most discussed issue). Only moderate links were found between what happy couples said was their most serious concern and what they actually tried to resolve during observations of marital problem\u2010solving, but there were differences in how spouses behaved based on the proportion of their time discussing certain topics. Findings suggest that more attention should be devoted to understanding what marital issues happy couples discuss and why, as doing so may reveal how couples maintain their marital happiness."}, {"comment_id": "f0mafrw", "post_id": "d5hnn0", "comment": "Seems like the press-release article, as well as the discussion here, is [Survivorship Bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias) at its finest!\n\nOnly intact couples were polled, without input from dissolved couples.

The controversial implication is that depressed people deliberately act in ways that are likely to maintain their low mood.

Do people with MDD actually prefer sad stimuli, potentially perpetuating their depression? Millgram, Joormann, Huppert, and Tamir (2015) observed such preferences and interpreted them as reflecting a maladaptive emotion regulatory goal to upregulate sad feelings. We assessed emotional music choice among both those with MDD and healthy controls (HC), and assessed the reasons for music preferences in these two groups. Seventy-six female participants (38 per group) completed two tasks: (1) Millgram et al.\u2019s (2015) music task wherein participants listened to happy, neutral, and sad music excerpts and chose the one they wanted to listen to most, and (2) a novel Emotional Music Selection Task (EMST) wherein participants chose preferred music clips, varying in emotion and energy level, in paired-choice trials. In the replication music task, MDD people were more likely to choose sad music. However, inconsistent with any motivation to upregulate sadness, people with MDD reported that they chose sad music because it was low in energy levels (e.g., relaxing). EMST results revealed that MDD people had a stronger preference for both low energy and sad music, relative to HC. The strong appeal of sad music to people with MDD may be related to its calming effects rather than any desire to increase or maintain sad feelings."}, {"comment_id": "elnfj03", "post_id": "bgtfsb", "comment": "So, based off this article should parents and teachers be concerned when children seem attracted to sad music?

That is, unless you\u2019re an insomniac, research at the Netherlands Institute for Neuroscience shows. The scientists asked participants to relive their most shameful experiences of decades ago while making MRI scans of their brain activity. While good sleepers literally settled those experiences in their head as neutralized memories, people with insomnia were not able to do so. This breakthrough finding suggests that insomnia could primarily be caused by a failing neutralization of emotional distress. Which makes it understandable that insomnia is the primary risk factor for the development of disorders of mood, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress. The findings were published on 25 April in the leading scientific journal Brain.\n\nMALADAPTIVE SLEEP\nIt is a well-known fact that sleep helps us to remember important experiences. But sleep is also essential for getting rid of the emotional distress that may have occurred during those experiences. Both these overnight processes involve changes in the connections between brain cells: some become stronger and consolidate memories, whereas others are weakened and get rid of unwanted associations. \u201cSayings like \u2018sleeping on it\u2019 to \u2018get things off your mind\u2019 reflect our nocturnal digestion of daytime experiences.

They evaluated whether brain activity elicited by re-living emotional memories from the distant past resembles the activity from new emotional experiences more in insomnia disorder than in normal sleepers. In normal sleepers, re-living of shameful experiences from the past did not elicit a limbic response (limbic system is an area of the brain controlling emotional expression).

Growth trajectory for soft drinks resumed previous trend as soon as 2015\n- Diet soft drinks got an immediate boost in 2014 (though they are still a small part of the market)\n- Lots of people seemed to switch to smaller pack sizes (e.g. 12oz cans instead of liter bottles), because the tax was imposed on a per-liter basis.  So rather than buy big bottles, people bought more, small cans, because the price of each can went up less.\n- I'm not sure what happened to non-carbonated sugary beverages past 2014, but I believe they kept growing despite the tax\n\nSo what did we learn?\n\n- The Mexican government loves to tout this as a win, though the lasting effect is pretty unclear\n- The effect was very short lived on many types of beverages, including soda\n- This didn't really affect Coke or Pepsi much at all, since soda drinkers seemed to either keep drinking it, switch to cans, or buy diet soda.  What it did do was kill off competition from other beverage types.\n- People who are very price sensitive down to the centavo (likely poorer people) seemed to switch to packages with less expensive taxes imposed, though it's not clear their total consumption declined\n\nSo I'm not sure what to say about this tax.  I don't think you can really call it a win for public health, because the lasting effect is not really clear.  People certainly aren't drinking any less soda, but they are probably drinking a bit less other sugary drinks like juice.

I think sugar-sweetened beverages and tobacco products are different enough to justify thinking about them differently from a taxing perspective. While sugar consumption does trigger the brain's reward center, sugar is not chemically addictive in the way that nicotine is. Furthermore, whereas over-consumption of sugar can lead to diseases like diabetes and obesity, these diseases are chronic and far more manageable than the acute diseases caused by tobacco products (lung cancer, etc.). \n\nThere's also an information argument to be made. Tobacco consumption became entrenched in the U.S. before people really understood the risks of tobacco consumption. Now, it's basically impossible to not know that tobacco products are harmful\u2014as a result of public school programs like DARE, public service advertising campaigns, and the like. With soda, the nutritional content of soda is right there on the can, just like every other food product.

Adoption remains poorly documented and its proximate causes are controversial. Here, we describe a unique case of a cross\u2010genus adoption within a small community of common bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) at Rangiroa Atoll in French Polynesia. It involves a foster female adopting a presumed melon\u2010headed whale (Peponocephala electra) calf while already mothering its presumed biological offspring. While the inclusive fitness hypothesis can be rejected for this adult female mother, acquisition of parental skills is also unlikely to have driven adoption in parallel to natural motherhood. We argue that the primiparous foster mother\u2019s inexperience and personality may have contributed to factors driving such non\u2010adaptive behavior. We also propose that the adoptee\u2019s persistence in initiating and maintaining an association with the adult female bottlenose dolphin could have played a major role in the adoption\u2019s ultimate success, as well as the persistence of this cross\u2010genus adoption after the disappearance of the biological offspring.

In doing a little extra reading on the topic, I came across [this article](http://www.bmsg.org/resources/publications/sugar-water-gets-a-facelift-what-marketing-does-for-soda/), and though it's a little dated (most of the cited data is now about 10 years old), it's no less prescient since it describes how we got here, from a marketing standpoint.\n\nIn an FTC study from 2006, it was found that:\n\n> Carbonated beverages was the highest category in terms of marketing expenditure directed at children (ages 2-11) and adolescents (ages 12-17) ($492 million, compared to $294 million for restaurant foods, the next highest category);\n\n> Of the $492 million, 96% was directed at marketing to adolescents;\n\n> Carbonated beverage companies spent $21 million on advertising using Web sites, Internet, digital ads, word of-mouth, and viral marketing. Carbonated beverage companies spent more on \u201cnew media\u201d than did any other food or beverage category.\n\n> The 44 companies spent $91 million on in-store marketing and packaging of carbonated beverages, almost all of it directed toward teenagers\n\n> They spent $117 million marketing carbonated beverages using traditional promotional activities such as product placement ads appearing before or within a video game; ads preceding a home video or theatrical movie feature, including license fees paid to use a third-party animated character in advertising or for cross-promotional arrangements; sponsorships of sports teams and athletes; fees paid for celebrity endorsements; or product branding in conjunction with philanthropic endeavors.\n\nAdd to that the burgeoning notion of \"healthy\" soda alternatives manufactured by the same soda companies, e.g. \"fortified\" waters containing vitamins and minerals, when there is no evidence of these deficiencies among Americans. One example: CocaCola\u2019s Diet Coke Plus contains vitamins B4, B6, and B12, along with zinc and magnesium. Only people who are sick and really poor (and sometimes iron-deficient, pregnant women) need supplements.

Previously, we reported a clinical case of complete sensorimotor paralysis of the lower extremities in which EES restored the ability to stand and the ability to control step-like activity while side-lying or suspended vertically in a body-weight support system (BWS)4. Since then, dynamic task-specific training in the presence of EES, termed multimodal rehabilitation (MMR), was performed for 43 weeks and resulted in bilateral stepping on a treadmill, independent from trainer assistance or BWS. Additionally, MMR enabled independent stepping over ground while using a front-wheeled walker with trainer assistance at the hips to maintain balance. Furthermore, MMR engaged sensorimotor networks to achieve dynamic performance of standing and stepping. To our knowledge, this is the first report of independent stepping enabled by task-specific training in the presence of EES by a human with complete loss of lower extremity sensorimotor function due to SCI."}, {"comment_id": "e6lsiq4", "post_id": "9ir7g9", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e6lu1sh", "post_id": "9ir7g9", "comment": "How were leg muscles able to work after 5 years of no activity and atrophy?"}, {"comment_id": "e6lzphi", "post_id": "9ir7g9", "comment": "This is amazing, but perhaps the craziest part is that the doctors still aren\u2019t even sure how it works, if I understood the article correctly.

The design captures \u223c1 Mt-CO2/year in a continuous process using an aqueous KOH sorbent coupled to a calcium caustic recovery loop. We describe the design rationale, summarize performance of the major unit operations, and provide a capital cost breakdown developed with an independent consulting engineering firm. We report results from a pilot plant that provides data on performance of the major unit operations. We summarize the energy and material balance computed using an Aspen process simulation. When CO2 is delivered at 15 MPa, the design requires either 8.81 GJ of natural gas, or 5.25 GJ of gas and 366 kWhr of electricity, per ton of CO2 captured. Depending on financial assumptions, energy costs, and the specific choice of inputs and outputs, the levelized cost per ton CO2 captured from the atmosphere ranges from 94 to 232 $/t-CO2.\n\nCompany Article [here](http://carbonengineering.com/climate-change-breakthrough/)"}, {"comment_id": "e0aaiiw", "post_id": "8pbuqv", "comment": "I did some math on this based on the article in Joule, please criticize:\n\nOk so we gonna need to extract roughly 4000Gt of CO2 from the atmosphere **that we do nothing with** until 2100. That means we need 50,000 plants fully operational now. We don't have that. So let's say we build all the plants we need in the coming 20 years. That means we only have 60 years to let them run, so we need to build 67,000 plants instead. But wait there's more, running these plants will also produce 2000Gt CO2 from the burning of natural gas... So effectively we only capture 0.5 Mt CO2 per year and plant. So we need not 67,000 plants, but 130,000 plants.\n\nOk, the extraction cost is $150/t-CO2, so that's $1200 trillion, about 7% of the world GDP from 2040 to 2100 assuming 2.5% annual growth. The electricity needed will be 2 million TWh, or 12% the energy that the world produces in 60 years assuming 1.67% annual energy production growth. The plants will require 4600 km^(3) of natural gas, or 2.6% of our reserves.\n\nAnd all this, is *just* to avoid climate catastrophe, none of this leads to \"carbon neutral transportation fuel\", if you want to do that you have to build a lot more plants and use more natural gas.

You burn it, the gas is released like normal, but then you collect that CO2 and reprocess it, so theres no net increase in greenhouse gas emissions. It wouldn't be useful as an energy source itself obviously, but it would be very useful as energy *storage*. Batteries are cool and all, but they're expensive as fuck, and have poor density. We're still a while from being able to go all-solar for electricity because nighttime exists, and for transport applications it may never happen because batteries are too heavy, but if we use chemical storage like this it becomes trivial.\n\nPlenty of other benefits to this too. Methane is a lot friendlier to work with than a lot of the other chemical fuels currently in use. For planes and rockets, you get a higher specific impulse than kerosene, very little coking, its gassifiable (autogeneous tank pressurization is possible, spark ignition is trivial, engine design in general is easier to simulate, full flow staged combustion is possible, deeper throttling). For ocean ships, most current fuel sources have a lot of really awful shit in them beyond the simple greenhouse gas problem. And if all this infrastructure already exists for methane anyway, you can more easily make use of methane which is currently a byproduct of other stuff, and is either vented (waaaay worse than CO2) or uselessly burned (mostly thinking of cows here. Flatulant fucks...)\n\nInitially of course, you'd need the rock storage thing this article discusses, since the objective is to decrease CO2 not merely maintain levels.

The domain of mate selection and concomitant behaviour may seem simple (\u201cMen are from Mars, women are from Venus.\u201d), but the problem is that we\u2019re not always clear about what we\u2019re talking about, and when it comes to human behaviour we have to tease apart what people believe (about themselves and others) from what their behaviour actually indicates, and further discern plausible mechanisms driving both of these.

The latter could be measured in terms of laughter production, but even that is fraught, since we may find social determinants of laughter.\n\nThe plausibility of an evolutionary hypothesis for sexual dimorphism in humour production depends not on our existing hunches about men and women, but on whether we can show that there is, in fact, an underlying genetic mechanism that confers an evolutionary benefit (either in terms of mate selection, or in terms of overall genetic fitness, or whatever).\n\nBut I think it\u2019s too simplistic to say that this would imply that men are funnier than women, even on average.

We included studies where participants created humor output that was assessed for funniness by independent raters. Our meta-analysis includes 36 effect sizes from 28 studies published between 1976 and 2018 (N = 5057, 67% women). Twenty of the 36 effect sizes, accounting for 61% of the participants, were not previously published. Results based on random-effects model revealed that men's humor output was rated as funnier than women's, with a combined effect size d = 0.321. Results were robust across various moderators and study characteristics, and multiple tests indicated that publication bias is unlikely. Both evolutionary and cultural explanations were considered and discussed."}, {"comment_id": "f5adm4p", "post_id": "dnccrv", "comment": "Jumping to the evolutionary basis seems like a major leap to me.

Drawing on interviews with 20 professionals in training, our qualitative analysis uncovered various tactics (both constructive and maladaptive) used by these individuals to cope with perceived impostorism. Among these tactics, seeking social support from individuals outside of their program peer group (e.g., professors, family, friends, and significant others) appeared to be more effective in dampening perceptions of impostorism than seeking support from peers within their program. We use Conservation of Resources Theory (COR) to develop testable hypotheses about this observed relationship between different sources of social support and perceptions of impostorism, and find support for this pattern of results in a group of 213 professionals in training. We also discuss the implications for research on impostorism, COR, social support, and early career entry."}, {"comment_id": "f1aylbn", "post_id": "d8kayi", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "f1b5e5f", "post_id": "d8kayi", "comment": "I think it\u2019s just a product of how we act socially.

Previous epidemiological research estimates that coal-fired electrical generation in the United States causes 52,000 deaths/year. This study estimates photovoltaics (including production, installation, and maintenance) cause 1 death/year. So the net premature deaths avoided per year is 51,999.\n\nYes, the significant figures are probably wrong.\n\n----\n\n[E. W. Prehoda, J. M. Pearce, Potential lives saved by replacing coal with solar photovoltaic electricity production in the U.S. *Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews*. **80**, 710\u2013715 (2017).](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.119)\n\n> **Abstract:** Poor air quality from coal combustion adversely impacts human health including mortality and morbidity effects on respiratory, cardiovascular, nervous, urinary, and digestive systems. However, the continued use of coal are no longer necessary to provide for society's electrical needs because of advances in solar photovoltaic (PV) technology. In order to inform health policy this paper reviews the data for quantifying the lives saved by a replacement of U.S. coal-fired electricity with solar PV systems. First the geospatial correlation with coal fired power plants and mortality is determined for the U.S. at the state level. Then, current life cycle mortality rates due to coal combustion are calculated and current energy generation data is collated. Deaths/kWh/year of coal and PV are calculated, and the results showed that 51,999 American lives/year could be saved by transitioning from coal to PV-powered electrical generation in the U.S. To accomplish this, 755 GW of U.S. PV installations are needed. The first costs for the approach was found to be roughly $1.45 trillion. Over the 25 year warranty on the PV modules the first cost per life saved is approximately $1.1 million, which is comparable to the value of a human life used in other studies. However, as the solar electricity has value, the cost per life is determined while including the revenue of the solar electric generation using a sensitivity analysis on the value of the electricity. These results found that for most estimations of the value, saving a life by offsetting coal with PV actually saved money as well, in some cases several million dollars per life. It is concluded that it is profitable to save lives in the U.S. with the substitution of coal-fired electricity with solar power and that the conversion is a substantial health and environmental benefit."}, {"comment_id": "didyfb0", "post_id": "6ew8ws", "comment": "how are they calculating the 2.5 million\n\nthese coal workers aren't stepping into other lucrative careers"}, {"comment_id": "didtfs1", "post_id": "6ew8ws", "comment": "I generally agree with what this article is presenting; but how is this quantifiable?"}, {"comment_id": "didr6bq", "post_id": "6ew8ws", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "diduf9v", "post_id": "6ew8ws", "comment": "Why do people avoid nuclear power?

So far, the device operates by applying a small voltage to a control electrode or \u201cgate\u201d within the aqueous electrolyte. Here, the operation of the atomic device in the quasi\u2010solid state is demonstrated. Gelation of pyrogenic silica transforms the electrolyte into the quasi\u2010solid state, exhibiting the cohesive properties of a solid and the diffusive properties of a liquid, preventing the leakage problem and avoiding the handling of a liquid system. The electrolyte is characterized by cyclic voltammetry, conductivity measurements, and rotation viscometry. Thus, a first demonstration of the single\u2010atom transistor operating in the quasi\u2010solid\u2010state is given. The silver single\u2010atom and atomic\u2010scale transistors in the quasi\u2010solid\u2010state allow bistable switching between zero and quantized conductance levels, which are integer multiples of the conductance quantum G0 = 2e2/h. Source\u2013drain currents ranging from 1 to 8 \u00b5A are applied in these experiments. Any obvious influence of the gelation of the aqueous electrolyte on the electron transport within the quantum point contact is not observed.\n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "e4ernh3", "post_id": "98bj81", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e4epjfz", "post_id": "98bj81", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e4er1p1", "post_id": "98bj81", "comment": "Sounds like the transistor needs to be imbedded in gel?

In this way, we can control for many things that people are mentioning as possible confounders, like the political leanings of a state. Our analysis therefore takes care of anything that is stable in time but differs across states (such as general political views) and also things that are common to all states and changing over time (nation-wide suicide trends or changes in views about LGB people due to mass media that affects the whole country, for example.) Then, we carried out many (many!) robustness and falsification checks (not all can be reported in the published paper, btw) to check on two important things: (1) how robust are our findings to small changes in our assumptions or changes in exactly how we calculate the effect, and (2) whether our method leads us to find other effects that we know do not exist, which would indicate that the method itself is picking up something strange in the data and not a true effect. \n\nI\u2019ll stick around for a while and try to answer some questions.

I'm especially seeing a lot of misuse of the phrase \"correlation does not imply causation.\"  So I'm going to give an overview of natural experiments (I'm an economist, and economists use 'natural experiments' a lot).  \n\nSuppose you were to look at the rates of depression among those who use antidepressants and those who do not.  Depression is higher among those who use antidepressants.  Do antidepressants cause depression?  Everyone knows 'correlation does not imply causation'.  Let's get a little more sophisticated.\n\nSuppose we flip a coin, and give a depressed person an antidepressant if the coin lands on heads and a sugar pill if the coin lands on tails.  Then we compare depression rates among those who got the antidepressant and those who got the sugar pill.  Depression is lower among those who got the antidepressant than among those who got the sugar pill.  Antidepressants reduce depression.  \n\n\"But I thought correlation doesn't imply causation?\"  Well, in this case it does.  The reason why is because the treatment variable -- antidepressant use -- is *exogenous*.  By the design of the experiment, treatment use is uncorrelated with any of the other things that cause depression and itself is not caused by depression.  When we looked at antidepressant use in the population at large, antidepressant use is *endogenous*.  People choose to use antidepressants, and the reasons why they choose to use antidepressants may cause, be caused by, or actually be depression.  \n\nOne key thing to note here is that we don't need an experiment per se to get at causality.  We need exogenous variation.  \n\nSo let's take another example.  Suppose the machinery at the pharmaceutical plant malfunctioned, and half of the prescriptions that came from this plant contain only filler, while the other half contain the antidepressant.  The machines malfunctioned in such a way that that it was basically a coin flip who got which prescription.  But we were able to figure out who got the fake or the real antidepressant through the serial numbers.  Then we compare the rates of depression among those who got the antidepressant and those who got the filler.  Again, this will show us the effect of antidepressant usage among those who filled a prescription because variation in who got the antidepressant (versus the filler) among those who filled a prescription was determined exogenously by mechanical failure.  This wasn't an experiment per se.  It was a natural experiment.\n\nCorrelation does imply causation, at least in large samples.  There are four possibilities for any correlation.  (1) it's due to sampling variance (no causation), which disappears with large samples, so let's ignore that for now;  (2) The first variable caused the second variable; (3) the second variable caused the first variable; (4) both variables were caused by some other variable. \n\nExogenous variation can tell you the amount of causation in one direction.  If you change the first variable exogenously, then this variation in the first variable was not caused by the second variable and was not caused by some other variable.  Which means the only explanation that remains is that the first variable caused the second variable.  This is why experiments allow you to interpret correlations as causal.  Again, you don't actually need an experiment.  What you need is a source of exogenous variation.  Depending on the application, this could be unexpected weather (to find the effect of reduction in the supply of oranges on the price of oranges), this could be a supreme court decision that struck down a federal law, which meant that law reverted to a variety of state laws that had been on the books but not binding for over a century (this actually happened, and can be used to measure the effect of different state laws)), this could be inheriting one allele instead of another once you control for your parent's alleles (the law of independent assortment makes this a coin flip, and allows you to measure the effect of the allele, or better, the effect of the thing the allele causes if it principally causes only one thing), etc.  \n\nSo now that we are done with the background, what do we think about this particular 'natural experiment'?  The question is if law change truly was exogenous.  It probably wasn't, but magnitudes matter. States that pass such laws will tend to be different than states that don't. Typically in these sorts of studies, you include state fixed effects and trends, so that you look at the change in outcome (teen suicide) with the change in law. States that don't change their laws act as control.  But importantly, states that change their laws latter act as controls for states that change their laws earlier.  So the real question is: \"In the states that changed their law, did something else change contemporaneously that may have reduced teen suicide? And in particular, was this something else itself not caused by the law change?\"  This is a judgement call.  When you have a truly randomized experiment, then the answer is obvious.  But when you use law change, you need to worry that whatever caused the law to change also caused the outcome.  One obvious candidate for this \"something else\" is gay rights activism.  That is, law change was endogenous to activism, and activism, together with changing social norms, caused the reduction in suicide rates.  So the authors moved the goal post when they talked about this as a \"mechanism\" (this really isn't a mechanism -- a mechanism intermediates. As a trivial example, if increased school funding only increased student outcome when the increased school funding decrease class size, then class size might be a mechanism.  But activism doesn't intermediate the effect of the law change if the law change didn't cause activism).  In this case, legalizing marriage in other states would not reduce suicide because legalizing marriage would not generate activism.  \n\nAll told, I'm skeptical that gay marriage legalization per se reduces teen suicide rate, but I think it is likely that changes in social norms did.  \n"}, {"comment_id": "ddzdk9o", "post_id": "5v5akf", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ddzluky", "post_id": "5v5akf", "comment": "I suspect that this has more to do with the perceived social acceptance of LGB vs. the actual legalization. i.e. Leading up to legalization of same-sex marriage, the subject of LGBT is widely discussed and socialized in the media, followed by a legal acknowledgment and recognition.

Following a thorough statistical review of all significant neuroimaging studies, we offer strong quantitative evidence that the neuronal response to visual sexual stimuli, contrary to the widely accepted view, is independent of biological sex. Both men and women show increased activation in many cortical and subcortical brain regions thought to be involved in the response to visual sexual stimuli, while the limited sex differences that have been found and reported previously refer to subjective rating of the content.\n\nAbstract\n\nSexual arousal is a dynamical, highly coordinated neurophysiological process that is often induced by visual stimuli. Numerous studies have proposed that the cognitive processing stage of responding to sexual stimuli is the first stage, in which sex differences occur, and the divergence between men and women has been attributed to differences in the concerted activity of neural networks. The present comprehensive metaanalysis challenges this hypothesis and provides robust quantitative evidence that the neuronal circuitries activated by visual sexual stimuli are independent of biological sex. Sixty-one functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (1,850 individuals) that presented erotic visual stimuli to men and women of different sexual orientation were identified. Coordinate-based activation likelihood estimation was used to conduct metaanalyses. Sensitivity and clustering analyses of averaged neuronal response patterns were performed to investigate robustness of the findings. In contrast to neutral stimuli, sexual pictures and videos induce significant activations in brain regions, including insula, middle occipital, anterior cingulate and fusiform gyrus, amygdala, striatum, pulvinar, and substantia nigra. Cluster analysis suggests stimulus type as the most, and biological sex as the least, predictor for classification. Contrast analysis further shows no significant sex-specific differences within groups. Systematic review of sex differences in gray matter volume of brain regions associated with sexual arousal (3,723 adults) did not show any causal relationship between structural features and functional response to visual sexual stimuli. The neural basis of sexual arousal in humans is associated with sexual orientation yet, contrary to the widely accepted view, is not different between women and men."}, {"comment_id": "etviwek", "post_id": "cdnm9c", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "etv6kpf", "post_id": "cdnm9c", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "etvhq2u", "post_id": "cdnm9c", "comment": "Hardly surprising.

Vocal traditions and vocal learning provide a strong foundation for studying culture and its transmission in both humans and cetaceans. Male humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) perform complex, culturally transmitted song displays that can change both evolutionarily (through accumulations of small changes) or revolutionarily (where a population rapidly adopts a novel song). The degree of coordination and conformity underlying song revolutions makes their study of particular interest. Acoustic contact on migratory routes may provide a mechanism for cultural revolutions of song, yet these areas of contact remain uncertain. Here, we compared songs recorded from the Kermadec Islands, a recently discovered migratory stopover, to multiple South Pacific wintering grounds. Similarities in song themes from the Kermadec Islands and multiple wintering locations (from New Caledonia across to the Cook Islands) suggest a location allowing cultural transmission of song eastward across the South Pacific, active song learning (hybrid songs) and the potential for cultural convergence after acoustic isolation at the wintering grounds. As with the correlations in humans between genes, communication and migration, the migration patterns of humpback whales are written into their songs."}, {"comment_id": "ez4v3m0", "post_id": "d018w0", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ez4vxn4", "post_id": "d018w0", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ez5qaob", "post_id": "d018w0", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ez5oquf", "post_id": "d018w0", "comment": "But if other whales have also traveled then everyone will be singing songs from different regions.

One of the confounds here is that people who drink moderately differ from people who are abstinent in a lot of ways.  We have reported that moderate drinkers have lower levels of C-reactive protein than do abstinent older adults, and we have another study currently under review that reports a second mechanism by which this relationship exists.\n\n\u200b\n\nSo, as someone who has done some of this work, data management is everything - what is being compared to what and what is being controlled for.  For instance, \"Then, for a given location and year, we rescaled age-specific and sex-specific estimates of individual-level consumption so that they aggregated to the estimates of population-level consumption... Finally, we rescaled estimates of current drinking and abstention so that, within a given location, year, age group, and sex, the two estimates summed to one...\" There were other imputations involving tourism, off-market alcohol production, etc.  Theoretical minimum exposure levels were extrapolated.  Epidemiological studies often involve a ton of data work, and this is more extensive than most I've seen on this subject.  It's not clear to me that such extensive data manipulation necessarily improve the interpretability of the results, and as a decent statistician who doesn't know everything, I say this with equal parts humility and skepticism.\n\n\u200b\n\nThe authors are right that alcohol abuse causes very considerable hardship, disease, and misery around the world, but the application of their sentiments to moderate use are, from my perspective, alarmist.\n\n\u200b\n\nFrom the paper:\n\n\"With this analysis, we only found statistically significant evidence for the J-shaped curve for ischaemic heart disease; non-significant J-shaped curves were observed for diabetes and isch- aemic stroke. For ischaemic heart disease, we found a minimum relative risk of 0\u00b786 (0\u00b780\u20130\u00b796) for men and 0\u00b782 (0\u00b772\u20130\u00b795) for women, occurring at 0\u00b783 standard drinks daily for men and 0\u00b792 standard drinks daily for women. We found no significant difference in relative risk curves for ischaemic heart disease or diabetes when estimating the curves by age. For all other out- comes, including all cancers, we found that relative risk monotonically increased with alcohol consumption.\"\n\n\u200b\n\nSo, the health benefits associated with moderate alcohol use were demonstrated here for some health outcomes."}, {"comment_id": "e4u5f1y", "post_id": "99t5i7", "comment": "Let me just say, I don't drink any alcohol and I'm in terrible physical shape.

This study investigates the association between prenatal tetanus, diphtheria, acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccination and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) risk in offspring.\n\nMETHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study of mother-child pairs with deliveries January 1, 2011 to December 31, 2014 at Kaiser Permanente Southern California hospitals. Maternal Tdap vaccination from pregnancy start to delivery date was obtained from electronic medical records. A diagnosis of ASD was obtained by using International Classification of Diseases, Ninth and Tenth Revision codes. Children were managed from birth to first ASD diagnosis, end of membership, or end of follow-up (June 30, 2017). Cox proportional hazards models estimated the unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) for the association between maternal Tdap vaccination and ASD, with inverse probability of treatment weighting to adjust for confounding.\n\nRESULTS: Women vaccinated were more likely to be Asian American or Pacific Islander, be nulliparous, have a higher education, receive influenza vaccination prenatally, and give birth at term. ASD was diagnosed in 1341 (1.6%) children, and the incidence rate was 3.78 per 1000 person years in the Tdap exposed and 4.05 per 1000 person years in the unexposed group (HR: 0.98, 95% confidence interval: 0.88\u20131.09). The inverse probability of treatment weighting\u2013adjusted analyses revealed that prenatal Tdap vaccination was not associated with an increased ASD risk (HR: 0.85, 95% confidence interval: 0.77\u20130.95).\n\nCONCLUSIONS: Prenatal Tdap vaccination was not associated with an increased ASD risk. We support recommendations to vaccinate pregnant women to protect infants, who are at highest risk of death after pertussis infection."}, {"comment_id": "e43t62a", "post_id": "96wvek", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "e43vjgo", "post_id": "96wvek", "comment": "Is there any research on how effective these kinds of studies are in convincing anti-vaxxers?\n\nOne of the largest issues with conspiracy theorists is that any pushback against their belief seems to have the opposite effect, and only emboldens them.

It\u2019s easy to conflate the timing of a vaccine (18 or 24 months) with the timing of autism\u2019s symptoms or a diagnosis, but one thing we do know from all the research is that autism develops before birth.

Millions of people around the world have avoided illnesses that, in previous years, have killed whole swathes of populations (Polio myelitis, smallpox, anthrax, measles mumps and rubella, the list goes on), and we've eradicated two viruses (Smallpox and SARS) thanks to vaccinations.\n\nE) Put in basic terms: Ingesting high quantities of soy sauce is more dangerous than getting a vaccine.\n\nIf you're planning on getting married and having kids, ask your partner about their beliefs on vaccination, and take them to update their own vaccination schedule. \n\nHell, we've got a rabies vaccine for our dogs and cats. Does that mean some of us care more about our dogs than our kids?

The Bayley Scales of Infant Development, 3rd edition cognitive composite score at day 365 was the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included tolerance measures through day 365, additional neurodevelopmental and language outcomes, growth, and medically confirmed adverse events through day 545.\n\nResults\n\nOf 451 infants enrolled (control, 228; MFGM + LF, 223), 291 completed study feeding and Bayley-III testing at day 365 (control, 148; MFGM + LF, 143). The mean cognitive (+8.7), language (+12.3), and motor (+12.6) scores were higher (P < .001) for the MFGM + LF group; no differences were observed at day 545. Global development scores from day 120 to day 275 and attention at day 365 were significantly improved. Few group differences in day 545 neurodevelopmental outcomes were detected, however scores of some subcategories of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories were higher (P < .05) in the MFGM + LF group. The overall incidence of respiratory-associated adverse events and diarrhea were significantly lower for the MFGM + LF group through day 545.\n\nConclusions\n\nInfants receiving formula with added bovine MFGM and bovine lactoferrin had an accelerated neurodevelopmental profile at day 365 and improved language subcategories at day 545. Formulas were associated with age-appropriate growth and significantly fewer diarrhea and respiratory-associated adverse events through 545 days of age."}, {"comment_id": "f547ixh", "post_id": "dmpv7q", "comment": "Noticeably higher or are we talking a 92 instead of a 91?"}, {"comment_id": "f542dkj", "post_id": "dmpv7q", "comment": "Would it be possible to add this fat into formula? or somehow give it to infants?"}, {"comment_id": "f5436cn", "post_id": "dmpv7q", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "f54ysjp", "post_id": "dmpv7q", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "f544usu", "post_id": "dmpv7q", "comment": "Question - does freezing the milk destroy the membrane? \n\nBecause I see a lot of people freezing the milk - and I'm wondering if that might actually be bad..."}, {"comment_id": "f545gtr", "post_id": "dmpv7q", "comment": "The study highlights most formula does not contain fat droplets that human milk naturally produces and if those are added into formula, it increases its benefit to the child.

Little is known about the factors influencing how parents respond to their children engaging in gender-nonconforming behaviors, yet the way parents respond to such behaviors may be critical to supporting children\u2019s development\u2014particularly among children who frequently display gender-nonconforming traits and behaviors. This study examined parent and child characteristics that relate to how parents respond, or would respond, to gender-nonconforming behaviors. A community sample of parents (N = 236) completed an online survey that assessed how frequently their child engaged in gender-nonconforming behaviors, their own gender-atypical traits, attitudes toward gender, parenting style, and their discomfort with and attempts to change their child\u2019s gender-nonconforming behaviors. Parents reported greater discomfort with gender nonconformity when their child was male and less gender nonconforming and when they held more traditional gender role attitudes. After controlling for discomfort, parents reported more frequent efforts to change gender-nonconforming behaviors when their child was male, when they held more traditional attitudes toward gender roles, and if they had a warmer parenting style. Notably, boys\u2019 gender nonconformity was negatively associated with parent efforts to change behaviors. These data explicate the parent\u2013child contexts associated with parents\u2019 being uncomfortable with their child engaging in gender-nonconforming behaviors and intervening to change those behaviors to fit in with societal expectations for gender. Results from this study could inform intervention efforts to increase parental support for gender-nonconforming youths."}, {"comment_id": "elqpz46", "post_id": "bh7jjd", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "elqthyu", "post_id": "bh7jjd", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "elqsl2k", "post_id": "bh7jjd", "comment": "This doesn't surprise me - no parent wants their children to be unhappy, and as much progress as we made, it's hard to be a gay male, so if you feel like this is something you can change, you'll want to do it (as a parent).  Sorry for the rant, but I have a good, on point story:\n\nMy perspective on this, as a non-gay male, was formed back in the late 80s and very early 90s.  My experience with gays was mostly in New Orleans when I worked in hotels and restaurants.  After shifts in the restaurant industry, it's common to all go out and drink 'til dawn, so groups of us did that a lot.  The only thing really noticeable to me was that gay bars had the strongest drinks and best dancing (although I don't dance), and that all the gay guys were aggressively out, like they were always performing and had to keep up appearances.  I just figured \"that's how gay men are.\"\n\nFast forward a couple years.  I was waiting tables in Miami, and one of my co-workers was an older, out gay man.  I'll call him Rob.  Rob was not effeminate, but a pretty chill, happy guy, and didn't have that \"gay affect\" I usually expected.  We became friends, and one night during our team's obligatory after-shift drinks, I asked him what it was like to be gay.  \n\nRob got very serious, and told me that it wasn't a choice.  There was anguish in his face I'd never seen.  He told me that if he had any choice in the matter, he would not have chosen to be gay.  If he had a wish, he would have wished that he wasn't gay.  He said living gay was really, really hard, even if you didn't hate yourself for it.  \n\nThose few minutes drilled past my ignorance, past my guard, past any knee-jerk reaction I could have had and went straight to my core.  Here was this really cool, very centered, and self-assured gay man telling me that being gay sucks.  \n\nFortunately, I don't think I had a lot of latent homophobia to overcome, but what I instantly experienced was profound empathy.  It wasn't pity - no one needs that.  It was a simple recognition of how hard and unforgiving life is if you're different.  That spark of inspiration turned into a core value for me now, and it's been a profound resource for me to understand and get behind the amazing progress we've made in the past few years in this area.  \n\nAnd as an epilogue, that empathy was a huge factor in strengthening my relationship with my daughter when she came out to me.  She expected to be judged, or for me to react in a way that said this was a problem to be fixed.  But I had already worked through all that decades ago.  Instead, I was able to sincerely and instantly just tell her that I support her choice to love anyone she wants, and that I was grateful she trusted me enough to share something that I know is so terrifying.\n\nI wish this for everyone."}, {"comment_id": "elqpr2d", "post_id": "bh7jjd", "comment": "This seems to fit in with societal attitudes about traditional gender roles, and the idea of male dominated society.  A female pursuing traditionally male interests(STEM fields, wanting to join Boy Scouts rather than Girl Guides, play male dominated sports etc.) is considered a good thing, and we often actively encourage females to engage in these traditionally male dominated activities.  On the other hand, there's less encouragement for males to engage in traditionally female dominated roles(nursing, primary educators, administrative work, Girl Guides rather than Boy Scouts, female dominated sports/activities like gymnastics, figure skating, volleyball, etc.), which seems to imply that traditionally female activities are inherently less valuable than traditionally male activities.

Which is far more likely to happen if the parents are uncomfortable or concerned about the child's gender conform behaviour.  It may lead to the idea that identifying as the opposite gender is a road to be able to pursue particular interests without being bothered by other people.  \n\nOf course this is not to imply that all gender dysphoria is due to this.

The AITL method accounts for the total mass of insecticides used in the US, acute toxicity to insects using honey bee contact and oral LD50 as reference values for arthropod toxicity, and the environmental persistence of the pesticides. This screening analysis shows that the types of synthetic insecticides applied to agricultural lands have fundamentally shifted over the last two decades from predominantly organophosphorus and N-methyl carbamate pesticides to a mix dominated by neonicotinoids and pyrethroids. The neonicotinoids are generally applied to US agricultural land at lower application rates per acre; however, they are considerably more toxic to insects and generally persist longer in the environment. We found a 48- and 4-fold increase in AITL from 1992 to 2014 for oral and contact toxicity, respectively. Neonicotinoids are primarily responsible for this increase, representing between 61 to nearly 99 percent of the total toxicity loading in 2014. The crops most responsible for the increase in AITL are corn and soybeans, with particularly large increases in relative soybean contributions to AITL between 2010 and 2014. Oral exposures are of potentially greater concern because of the relatively higher toxicity (low LD50s) and greater likelihood of exposure from residues in pollen, nectar, guttation water, and other environmental media. Using AITL to assess oral toxicity by class of pesticide, the neonicotinoids accounted for nearly 92 percent of total AITL from 1992 to 2014. Chlorpyrifos, the fifth most widely used insecticide during this time contributed just 1.4 percent of total AITL based on oral LD50s. Although we use some simplifying assumptions, our screening analysis demonstrates an increase in pesticide toxicity loading over the past 26 years, which potentially threatens the health of honey bees and other pollinators and may contribute to declines in beneficial insect populations as well as insectivorous birds and other insect consumers."}, {"comment_id": "ewi998h", "post_id": "cohb2y", "comment": "Some guy came by my house to offer a pretty aggressive pest control \"service.\" Maybe I should have told him more directly that I think using insecticides to kill mass quantities of insects is a horrible idea.

Existing petroleum-derived polymeric membranes face major development barriers. Here, we demonstrate a first robust MD membrane directly fabricated from sustainable wood material. The hydrophobic nanowood membrane had high porosity (89 \u00b1 3%) and hierarchical pore structure with a wide pore size distribution of crystalline cellulose nanofibrils and xylem vessels and lumina (channels) that facilitate water vapor transportation. The thermal conductivity was extremely low in the transverse direction, which reduces conductive heat transport. However, high thermal conductivity along the fiber enables efficient thermal dissipation along the axial direction. As a result, the membrane demonstrated excellent intrinsic vapor permeability (1.44 \u00b1 0.09 kg m\u22121 K\u22121 s\u22121 Pa\u22121) and thermal efficiency (~70% at 60\u00b0C). The properties of thermal efficiency, water flux, scalability, and sustainability make nanowood highly desirable for MD applications."}, {"comment_id": "evvlene", "post_id": "clhwcb", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "evvjoxl", "post_id": "clhwcb", "comment": "Is this something that could eventually be small and cheap enough to put in a survival kit?"}, {"comment_id": "evvkvpb", "post_id": "clhwcb", "comment": "First off, holy cow what a cool paper.

It brings to question the motivation for publishing such a poll.\n\n If this was real science, they would've done multiple surveys on different topics in attempt to understand how members of different political parties are influenced on different topics. For example, you might find that the political affiliation has a large effect on some topics and little effect on other topics. Or you might find that democrats behave the same way as republicans but on different topics.\n\nBut this isn't a study, just a poll on a single topic.

People must respect authority, specifically in the religious circles, but also outside of it as long as they do not conflict with religious beliefs.\n\nThis concept of respect for authority seems to be present in conservative ideology, even in the absence of religiosity. Conservatism, by definition, aims to conservative values from an earlier era in US history; an era which, by some informal measure, was more focused on the authority held by people.\n\nThe Democratic Left, on the other hand, is more individualistic. People are free to do what they want, as long as they don't hurt others or themselves. From this perspective, there is nothing, initially, that differentiates one person from another in terms of worth or respect deserved.\n\nWhen your ideology is about authority, you tend to trust only your own authorities, especially when the others espouse ideology that is contrary to your own.
