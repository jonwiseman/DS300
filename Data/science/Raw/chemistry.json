The Super tells me to go pour bleach in it to help with the smell. Due to this piss sitting in a toilet in the middle of summer in TX I guess a lot of the water had evaporated leaving behind a ton of concentrated ammonia. We're talking super yellow piss. Like melted butter. I pour in the bleach, not thinking at all, and it immediately starts to bubble and almost boil. My lungs and nostrils started burning and i slammed the toilet lid and ran out.

My supervisor had an interest in household lead contamination so we arranged a sampling of a house known to have a lead contamination source (this was non-glossy PVC miniblinds). So we sampled the house with kimwipes which we then digested using concentrated nitric acid over heat (some of you may know where this is going). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe took over 500 samples and all of the digestion work was done by me in a few hoods using beakers covered with ribbed watch glasses. This was a laborious process that involved a lot of checking back and adding nitric acid to ensure complete digestion of the kimwipes. So I'd check a few times a day to make sure all was in order. After about the fifth morning I came back to find that a few of the watch glasses were off of the beakers. So I, being young and dumb, simply replaced the watch glasses and carried on thinking - \"How odd\". Over the next few days I found more watch glasses lying in the hood and I swore someone was playing a practical joke on me. I decided to sit there to make sure no one was coming in and out and after about 20 minutes, I heard a \"Pop\" sound and one of the watch glasses flew off and landed with a clank next to the hot plate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt didn't take me long to figure out that I was making explosives by adding nitro groups to the carbon-rich kimwipes due to the digestion process. The explosives were unstable, as TNT is unstable, and they would detonate with just enough pop to blow off the watch glasses but not break the beakers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis just reminded me of that. :)"}, {"comment_id": "em1h09f", "post_id": "bialcz", "comment": "When it turned brown, it looked like it had a chocolate syrup filling inside"}, {"comment_id": "em1h91l", "post_id": "bialcz", "comment": "Ew but cool"}, {"comment_id": "em1ilcb", "post_id": "bialcz", "comment": "I can smell this video"}, {"comment_id": "em1jbo8", "post_id": "bialcz", "comment": "What concentration did you put??"}, {"comment_id": "em1jzpv", "post_id": "bialcz", "comment": "Meh, peroxymonosulfuric is better"}, {"comment_id": "em1kafk", "post_id": "bialcz", "comment": "That toilet paper could have wiped a dirty asshole, you asshole whoever you are who did this to a good roll of toilet paper."}, {"comment_id": "em1nav3", "post_id": "bialcz", "comment": "I learned this being stupid and alone in the lab, dropped acid wanted to clean the evidence..

These atomic orbitals form rings with a rotating phase around the atom, and the phase dictates the dynamics during the electronic transition.\n\n[Here is the animation of the 1,0,0 -> 2,1,-1 transition](https://imgur.com/a/RMQA9gb)\n\n-- EDIT\n\n[Symmetry forbidden d-d (3,2,0) -> (3,2,1) transition](https://i.imgur.com/3gR2HHi.mp4)\n\n[Another d-d (3,2,0) -> (3,2,2) forbidden by both symmetry and angular momentum conservation](https://imgur.com/a/Lg0D76M)\n\n[GitHub](https://github.com/MaxParadiz/OrbitalTransitions)\n\n[Higher quality](https://i.imgur.com/EZmhliy.mp4)\n\nSince  lots of you liked the animations, I made an [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/MolecularOrbitals/) to share more as I render them "}, {"comment_id": "e5w9nmf", "post_id": "9ffuny", "comment": "I would love to use this as my lockscreen background on my phone but it can't be any longer than 15 seconds.

I understand the concept of electrons getting excited and jumping around to different orbitals (my understanding is that this plays a big part in why some materials are opaque and some are transparent, yes?).

I'll edit this comment to provide more detail: \n\n* What is occurring here is essentially combustion, but not dissolution. The swab is being fully converted to CO2 and steam, much like how it would if it were burned with flames. The slight yellow discoloration seen at the end of the video goes away after a few minutes, leaving a clarified solution of sulfuric acid. I didn't film it, but this solution went on to eat three more swabs before giving up midway on the fourth. \n* Piranha solution is very good at getting rid of things made of carbon and oxygen. From what I understand, the mixture first protonates alcohols, esters, ethers, etc. and then sequentially oxidizes those products closer to CO2 and steam. A polyethylene pipette, however, does not contain protonatable sites (it's aliphatic) and therefore does not react with piranha (though it may melt from the heat of reaction). In fact, I like to use polyethylene pipettes to wash the sides of my glassware as opposed to sloshing the mixture around in the container. Piranha is not very good at getting rid of some metals and minerals. You will need a separate acid mixture (like aqua regia) for that.\n* I like to use 3 to 4 parts (volumes) of 95-98% H2SO4 to 1 part (volume) of 30% aq. H2O2. If I'm cleaning something that is much dirtier or requires a large volume of piranha, I'll actually use persulfate piranha, where  potassium persulfate is mixed with 95-98% H2SO4 to form a slurry and then carefully heated to ~60-80 \u00b0C. Using potassium persulfate as the oxidizer as opposed to aqueous hydrogen peroxide has several benefits because 1) the oxidizer is not aqueous and thus does not have the heat of solution associated with water, 2) potassium persulfate is much easier to store than concentrated hydrogen peroxide, and 3) the required external heating provides a margin of safety - you choose when to let it react by providing a heat source (heat gun or hot plate). \n* I haven't tested this on silicates or silicones, but it appears that our vacuum grease goes away with my piranha (I'm not sure what we use though). What I recommend to any chemist is to thoroughly wipe off your ground glass joints with a KimWipe dampened with whatever solvent you're using before you decant things from a RBF, or simply use a long transfer pipette to avoid contacting the dirty necks altogether. Only apply vacuum grease to the top 1/4 to top 1/3 of the ground glass joint, as well. Also, try to use teflon tape or teflon sleeves on your joints as opposed to grease. \n* Do not make this material at home. It will burn and scar you before you can dilute it, wipe it away, or get help. \n* Some of the bubbling you see is due to oxygen release from thermal decomposition of hydrogen peroxide.\n"}, {"comment_id": "eiz4vyi", "post_id": "b3e0lo", "comment": "In my old lab no one labeled the Piranha which drove me up a wall, but I would take a drop of it and put it on a chem wipe.

It works thusly:\n\n\"Concretely, the principle of a vacuum coffee maker is to heat water in the lower vessel of the brewer until expansion forces the contents through a narrow tube into an upper vessel containing coffee grounds (as water temperature increases, dense liquid water increasingly converts to less dense water vapor gas, which takes up more space and thus increases pressure); when the water reaches and exceeds the boiling point (so the vapor pressure equals and then exceeds atmospheric pressure), the (water vapor) pressure in the lower vessel exceeds the (atmospheric) pressure in the top vessel and water is pushed up the siphon tube into the upper vessel. During brewing, a small amount of water and sufficient water vapor remain in the lower vessel and are kept hot enough so the pressure will support the column of water in the siphon. When enough time has elapsed that the coffee has finished brewing, the heat is removed and the pressure in the bottom vessel drops, so the force of gravity (acting on the water) and atmospheric pressure (pressing on the liquid in the upper vessel) push the water down into the lower vessel, through a strainer and away from the grounds, ending brewing. The coffee can then be decanted from the lower chamber; the device must usually be taken apart to pour out the coffee.\""}, {"comment_id": "f3ar75h", "post_id": "dg3dp3", "comment": "This is literally nothing.

The CO2 inside the bubble caused the bubble to expand until it met another smaller bubble already present on the table. Once this happened, gas escapes the original bubble hence inflation of the smaller bubble occurred. Even more, there is a third bubble present inside of both bubbles (the white spot at the junction) which is likely due to a high concentration of gas in the small bubbles produced upon initiation of the reaction."}, {"comment_id": "f5td3or", "post_id": "dp6zj3", "comment": "1GIRL2BEAKERS made me laugh so hard.
