I ripped out the mechanism of our old wind-up gramophone and put in a turntable and a three-valve amplifier. I made a speaker cabinet from an old book case, with a sheet of chip-board on the front. The whole system looked pretty crude, but it didn\u2019t sound too bad. At the time LPs were very expensive so I couldn\u2019t afford any of them on a schoolboy budget. But I bought Stravinsky\u2019s Symphony Of Psalms because it was on sale as a 10\u201d LP, which were being phased out. The record was rather scratched, but I fell in love with the third movement, which makes up more than half the symphony.\u201d\n\n\n[Wieniawski\u2019s Violin Concerto No. 1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aNOdaBJbT8A)Professor Hawking was actually inspired to buy a collection of Wieniawski\u2019s music after hearing his second concerto on Radio 3 in the 1990s, but prefers the first in particular for its \u201chaunting phrase in the first movement\u201d.\n\n\n[Francis Poulenc\u2019s Gloria](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ReqsEqKtyyA) is the final piece in Professor Hawking\u2019s musical trilogy. Part of the work caused a \u201cscandal\u201d \u2013 in the French composer\u2019s own words \u2013 when it was first performed in 1959 because of its unusual mixture of light-heartedness and spirituality. Poulenc later explained that he had been thinking of frescoes in which angels stick out their tongues and \u201cserious Benedictines whom I saw playing soccer one day\u201d when he wrote it.\nProfessor Hawking first heard the Poulenc Gloria in Aspen, Colorado, during the resort\u2019s 1995 music festival. \u201cYou can sit in your office in the physics centre there and hear the music without ever buying a ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on this occasion I was actually in the tent to hear the Gloria.

Trump and his cronies feed off demonstrations of outrage and angst from the intellectual crowd. Don't make him stronger. Other strategies would be more effective \n\n\nIt breaks my heart to see good movements expend tons of energy and resources on things that are not very effective.  Liberals for the most part have been fed and bred on this \"make noise and people will pay attention\" red herring that is not only false, but a story DESIGNED to waste energy in the most inefficient manner. \n\nLook what millions of people protests did pre-Iraq war? Nothing. Did the protests stop the GOP in Wisconsin from ramming through their legislation? NO. Did OWS stop or change the objectionable banking practices? No.\n\nI wish people would realize that a protest does nothing by itself. Look at some protests that WERE effective: \n\nMLK: led marches and sit-ins that were intended to get people arrested for blacks hanging out with whites SO THAT THEY COULD CHALLENGE THE LAWS IN COURT. So these actions just a means to an end. After being arrested their legal team led by Marshall came in and kicked ass. The strength was in boycotts and legal challenges. That was the success strategy of MLK. Not just the noisemaking. \n\nGandhi: his \"salt march\" was a boycott convincing people that they could break the law which forced them to buy salt at inflated prices. Kids today think that Gandhi just had people sit around and get beaten. NO. He said it was peaceful activities that had economic and legal impacts. Under his direction British revenues were crippled. Dropped some 40%. That is what got stuff done. Not the marches.\n\nBut today the public doesn't know what to do when faced with this challenge. They think that crowds makes a difference when all it does is get them put in some database of people for Trump to fire. \n\nThere are better alternatives. Take this guy who instead of holding a sign that was ignored, [buried a bad cop in paperwork](http://www.thestranger.com/seattle/hostile-policing/Content?oid=17445843) and the evidence of this bad cop's activities [got him fired](http://www.king5.com/story/local/2014/09/02/13384714/). \n\nTLDR; It is activities which drive change directly by economic, legal, or having direct political change (e.g. voter drives, recall petitions, FOIA requests, leaks to the media, etc) which are effective. Not just making noise. Yet the left has been brainwashed to think that making noise by itself without a plan is the best way to make an change. It isn't.

It was awful, I hate campaign. Months later I came back to my dorm room from Christmas break to find a ticket issued by the campus police for underage drinking, open intoxicants, and some other crap, not sure of what it all was. Hundreds of dollars in fines. \n\nI called the campus police and they said they searched all the dorm rooms during breaks, we did not own them or have any expectation of privacy. I should not be breaking the law. They also explained that this was all at the behest of the hall director, I'd have to take any appeals I had with him.\n\nSo I go down to the hall directors office, a place I'd never been before, and was immediately struck by the fact that his office was larger than any dorm room in the building by at least a factor of 2, and it was an office for 1 person. It even had a waiting room with a secretary... imagine the lady you'd pick to play a mean cranky secretary in a cheesy movie... she looked like that. I came walking in with the ticket in hand and she just frowned, like I was the 100th person to bother her with this bullshit that day, and said \"You have no expectation in the dorms. That is part of the dorm agreement, if you didn't break the law, you wouldn't be in this predicament, there are no appeals.\"\n\nand I said \"Yea, this is a ticket for underage drinking\" and she said \"Like I said, you shouldn't have broke the law...\" and I said \"The bottle was empty\" and she said \"It doesn't matter, it's evidence of a crime...\" but I jumped in \"...and I'm 22...\" and she just looked at me for a long time... \"You're going to have to wait over there... the director is busy\" and pointed at a chair.\n\nSo I waited for a while and then stood up \"This is fucking bullshit. I'm not waiting here because you people are morons.\" she clearly didn't want me in there either and said \"Fine, there's a photocopier over there, just photocopy your drivers license and I'll give it to him when he gets out of his meeting.\" \n\nSo I went over the photo copier, put my license on it, put my middle finger right next to it, made the copy, and then handed it to her and left.\n\n...and yes, I was eventually thrown out of the dorms. There was so much shit like that going on all the time, that eventually I just could help myself but troll them. I ended up in court a number of times with the campus police, those fuckers were basically above the law. If you think regular city police is fucked up, look up campus police sometime.

This and their equipment alone caused suspicion and they were detained several times.  Mechain measured Paris South across the Pyrenees and into Spain.  He got stuck in Spain trying to return, ended up sailing to Italy (I think), ended up back in Spain.  This time in Spain with all the triangulation completed he recomputed his starting points in a different direction; A to B instead of B to A and came up with a different number which meant that his original data was incorrect.  On return to Paris is spent maybe years trying to reconcile the data.  In the end the French Academy of Science realizing, because of the accuracy of their data, that not all meridians were the same length and abandoned this approach and used some other.  Mechain spent most of the rest of his life trying to reconcile his numbers.  He even got permission to go back (I think to Spain) and extend his measurements further South.

Dirac also contributed heavily to our understanding of spin statistics and the relation to relativity. It should also be noted that his contributions had immense mathematical ramifications, namely his work on monopoles is not only physically relevant to this day, but Dirac had stumbled upon fibre bundles 2 years before even the mathematicians, and this was during times when the physicists were the ones decades behind the mathematicians! Furthermore his techniques used to why \"wedding\" special relativity and quantum mechanics have led to the Dirac operator, a surprisingly useful concept relevant to SUSY and differential geometry.

Most notoriously, a t-handle spinning and weirdly rotating in space.\n\nThe Dzhanibekov seems very counterintuitive at first, although it is a consequence of very well established physics. So, I decided to test whether or not the effect was replicable with a physics engine. For this, I have used Unity 3D, which is one of the most popular game engines. And indeed, it does work without the need for any additional code!\n\nFor the simulation, I simply created three *rigidbodies* connected to a fourth one using *fixed joints*. Adding torque along the intermediate axis, causes the contraption to eventually flip, as predicted by the intermediate axis theorem.\n\nThis is such a good example of how, besides memes, game development can be used as a powerful educational tool. I also work as a lecturer in Game Development, Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning: being able to run \"virtual experiments\" is an incredible resource that should not be ignored.\n\nAnother example is how Unity can be used to demonstrate the [formation of crystal defects](https://twitter.com/AlanZucconi/status/862723192326062080?s=20) in materials. That is another topic inspired by a YouTube video by Steve Mould.\n\nI hope this post will spark a constructive discussion on how to use game development for educational purposes.\n\n\ud83e\uddd4\ud83c\udffb"}, {"comment_id": "f14y3wm", "post_id": "d7vlhd", "comment": "https://youtu.be/1VPfZ_XzisU \n\nI just watched this yesterday, it explains the phenomenon pretty well."}, {"comment_id": "f15fj2z", "post_id": "d7vlhd", "comment": "http://gfycat.com/OrnateSolidBilby"}, {"comment_id": "f14yv1m", "post_id": "d7vlhd", "comment": "haha no kidding! good ole physics man."}, {"comment_id": "f15yp53", "post_id": "d7vlhd", "comment": "If you do away with those pesky UIs and 3D graphics you're basically left with computational physics."}, {"comment_id": "f15d6qw", "post_id": "d7vlhd", "comment": "So does it switch based on distance travelled?

Technically this is static friction, which is sometimes called ' stiction'.\n\nAs the sand falls through the hourglass, its tendency to flip over is reduced, until it 'unsticks' from the side, and positively buoyant glass floats to the top, and the other descends to the bottom. The trick depends on the two hourglasses being only slightly positively or negatively buoyant. Were this not the case, their natural buoyancy would be strong enough to overcome the 'stiction' effect immediately, and the trick would not work.

We need to stop designing cities around cars.  No more square miles of nothing but single-family homes.  We also need to encourage culinary traditions that eat a helluva lot less meat, and discourage the prevailing corporate culture of sending employees on regular plane trips.  Otherwise there's just no way we'll be able to create a high standard of living for everyone.\n\n(1) Norgate, T. et al., \u201cThe Impact of Uranium Ore Grade on the Greenhouse Gas Footprint of Nuclear Power\u201d Journal of Cleaner Production 2014"}, {"comment_id": "e7jbx99", "post_id": "9n39ly", "comment": "Okay.

Most of the executives see them as a headache with constant huge costs to build and maintain while natural gas and renewables are so much cheaper. Building them is such a pain in the ass these days because of all the regulations, regulatory agencies, and incompetence of the \"experienced\" companies that still can build plants like Westinghouse, Areva, etc and always end up going past deadlines, over budget, etc. by large margins.\n\nI like nuclear power for a lot of reasons, but in my opinion it'll probably be mostly dead in the U.S. in the next two decades or so when the plants that have been operating since the '70s and '80s become so old and need so much maintenance work that the cost just doesn't make sense to the utilities any more. It's already been happening to a lot of plants across the U.S., and the companies that have decided to build one have almost universally had their share of fiascos and cost overruns mentioned before.\n\nProtip: If you want to study nuclear engineering, don't focus on power generation unless you just love taking huge gambles with your entire future career for some odd reason.

Ozone is O3, it has a cool resonace structure that allows for light to be absorbed and reemitted(ill get back to that in a second), it is formed from the NitroOxides in the air breaking bonds and releasing free N+ and O-. The N+ goes and make nitrogen gas N2, but the O- doesnt always make oxygen gas O2, it can sometime bond to O2 and form O3 ozone. Now this ozone, with an its extra ozyrgen, will have partial pi bonds that can take in UV radiation and stretch(resonates) the bonds of ozone. The radiation doesnt stay for very long and is emitted back out(phosphorescent), but at a lower wavelength than the original, the most common wavelength is around the visible blue light. Now this blue light is what eventually will be Raleigh scattered down throught the rest of the atmosphere until it eventually reaches our eye, so then at sunset the energy is further weakened because the light needs to travel through more medium until we see it. This makes the beautiful sunset with weaker wavelengths like reds and oranges.

This technique works by measuring the Doppler shift of the star's light, effectively looking at how much the star wobbles due to the gravitational field of the planet orbiting it. They found what's now known as a hot Jupiter planet - a very heavy planet orbiting very near it's star. These are some of the easiest planets to detect due to how strong their RV signal is, even though they're relatively uncommon. \n\nToday, thousands of exoplanets have been discovered using the RV, transit and direct imaging techniques, and we're just starting to be able to learn more about their atmospheric and surface properties. The James Webb Space Telescope and the various Extremely Large Telescopes will allow us to look closer at these planets, hopefully so that we can study earth-like planets and eventually find signs of life!

It's far from perfect, but I hope some of y'all may find it useful for addressing your own.\n\nTo whom it may concern,\n\nI am writing to convey my concerns about the effects of the Qualified Tuition Reductions provision in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on scientific research. In the US, graduate students are charged tuition by the institution they attend, but institutions normally waive tuition for graduate students working in technical fields. Under current law, this tuition waiver is tax-exempt. This means we are taxed on the stipend that we receive as usable income but not the tuition waiver. The current version of the bill eliminates the tuition waiver exemption. Its elimination would cripple scientific research by making it financially impossible to be a graduate student. As a concrete example, I\u2019m a PhD student in applied physics at Caltech in Pasadena. I make $2,500 per month pre-tax and my tuition waiver is $45,000 per year. Under current law, I make $2,300 post-tax. To make this work, I share a single-floor home 5 miles from campus with five other students where we\u2019ve converted the living room to a bedroom, bike commute, and avoid meat. If the tuition waiver exemption is discarded, I estimate owing $10,000/year in Federal taxes, making my monthly income at-most $1700; a 25% pay cut. Caltech is exceptionally generous with its stipends; many of my peers will be in even more dire situations. The increase in Federal taxes would make continuing my work impossible because completing a PhD takes six tumultuous years and $1700/month allows zero margin of error for dealing with unforeseen expenses. This would cripple science in the US because graduate students like myself are the backbone of research. Graduate students perform 90% of the day-to-day work in a lab and losing a significant fraction of us would make most labs completely non-productive. Scientific research will continue to be critical in the coming decades for maintaining the prosperity and security of the world. I therefore urge the house to reconsider its elimination of the waived tuition tax exemption.\n\nSincerely,\n\n/u/hairycheese\n"}, {"comment_id": "dpfquiq", "post_id": "7b6sny", "comment": "I've been out of grad school for a while.

China has been working *really* hard to attract its Phd contingent home upon graduation, and it has begun to really take off in the past decade.

Not anymore. \n\nThings like this make you miss the Cold War. With the threat of the USSR and its thousands of nuclear weapons looming, nobody in Washington dared screw with our future in this fashion, especially on unthinking ideological whims like this.

Alternatively, part of capital investment (in yourself) as costs of \"research\" which are allowed to be elected as business expenses?\n\nAll of this really just goes to show that removing an explicit tax exemption from tuition wavers is super stupid. I'm willing to bet some families/individuals with a lot of money and influence/knowledge of the tax code will do exactly as I said above, and claim exemptions for the above reasons so they end up in the same position as before, while everyone else gets slammed because they don't know about the loopholes.\n\nAlso, couldn't a school just move the money from a qulified tuition reduction (from 117(d)) to a qualified scholarship (117(a)) which the student then uses to pay for tuition (and is thus tax-exempt on that scholarship).\n\nFrom the new bill (taken from https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/02/us/politics/document-Read-the-G-O-P-Tax-Bill.html)\n\n>pg 78, lines 10-24\n\n>(a) IN GENERAL.--In the case of an individual, there shall be allowed as a credit aganst the tax imposed by this chapter for the taxable year an amount equal to the sum of \n\n>>(1) 100 percent of so much of the qualified tuition and related expenses paid by the taxpayer during the taable year (for education furnished to any eligible student for whom an election is in effet under this section for such taxable year during any academic period beginning in such taxable year) as does not exceed $2000, plus\n\n>>(2) 25 percent of so much expenses so paid as exceeds the dollar amount in effect under paragraph (1) but does not exceed twice such dollar amount\n\n\n>page 79, lines 1-9\n\n>(b) Portion of credit refundable.--40 percent of the credit allowable under subsection (a)(1) determined without regard to this subsection and section 26(a) and after application of all other provisions of this section) shall be treated as a credit allowable under subpart C (and not under this part). The preceeding sentence shall not apply to any taxpayer for any taxable year if such taxpayer is a child to whom section 1(d) applies for such taxable year.\n\n>page 79, lines 10-25 \n\n>>(paraphrased, I think I interpreted this right) subsection 1(c) say that your refund is scaled down by an amount proportional to \"the taxpayer's modified adjusted gross income\" in excess of $80,000 divided by $10,000.  (so, MAGI of 90k = 100%. MAGI of 84k = 40%. MAGI of 76k = 0%).\n\n>pg 84, lines 7-14\n\n>The amount of qualified tuition and related expenses otherwise taken into account under subsection (a) with respect to an individual for an academic period shall be reduced (before the application of subsection (c)) by the sum of any amounts paid for the benefit of such individual which are allocable to such period as--\n>>(A) a qualified scholarship which is excludable from gross income under section 117\n\nSo section 117 qualified scholarships reduce the tuition and related expenses. The individual refund is reduced to a maximum of $2500 (full $2000 plus 25% of next $4000) if the student paid $6000 in qualified tuition and related expenses. \n\nThis sounds like an easily solvable issue for universities, at least in terms of mitigating the damage done to the graduate students.\n\nAlso, there's\n\n>pg 96, lines 12-20\n\n>(a) IN GENERAL.-- Subchapter B of chapter 1 is ammended--\n\n>>(1) in part VII by striking sections 221 and 222 (and by striking the items relating to such sections in the table of sections for such part),\n\n>>(2) in part VII by striking sections 135 and 127 (and by strking the items relating to such sections in the table of sections for such part), and\n\n>>(3) by striking subsection (d) of section 117)\n\nBut the employee education deductions are in Subchapter B of chapter 1 in part III (section 127), not part VII.

This system has been observed a bajillion times, so it would be a really great video to stitch many versions together.\n\n2) It's really surprising that the astrometry (i.e. the determining the location of an object in an image) was so uncertain in the zoom in version. The error bars on that fast moving star are huge. I'm wondering if more modern algorithms/images can pinpoint the locations and thus the orbits better.\n\n3) The paper put constraints on the mass of the SMBH to be 3.7+/-1.5e6 Solar Masses. What are the current constraints, and do they come from the same kind of analyses?\n\n4) The standards for statistical analysis used in this paper were pretty good for their time and were released publicly [here](http://www.astro.gsu.edu/~gudehus/binary.html). However, the code *appears to be* (tough to tell) super dated and written for the OpenVMS operating system (yea I never heard of it either) with some kind of hacks to make it work on Macs. It would make for a really good undergrad or early grad project to re-implement the analysis in a modern language. It probably wouldn't result in a paper but one would learn a lot from doing so.

I like the attempt to do color for colored particles. That said, why are the Higgs, leptons, and electroweak bosons colored? In light of that, I would maybe suggest addressing the previous point by color coordinating charge and spin along with their definitions on the left.\n\n1. There is no discussion of mixing between weak eigenstates and mass eigenstates in either the quark sector (Cabibo angle) or in the neutrino sector. While the quark sector is roughly diagonal so it doesn't matter too much, the neutrino sector is very much off diagonal.\n\n1. Indicating that second generation quarks are unstable and decay is potentially a bit confusing due to confinement. I'm not sure how to better make that clear though.\n\n1. Having hadrons and GUT/TOE in the center and the largest seems like a problem to me. Hadrons aren't fundamental and the status of GUT/TOE is unknown.\n\n1. For color charge it is probably a good idea to mention that these things have nothing to do with traditional colors.\n\n1. The Higgs gives the W and the Z mass, but probably also the quarks and charged leptons.\n\n1. The weak interaction is left handed. This is very important and not mentioned anywhere. This is why we need a Higgs mechanism. If the weak interaction had any right handed component then particles could gain mass directly without electroweak symmetry breaking.\n\n1. Neutrinos have mass and we don't know how they get a mass.

The problem is there are 9 possible pairs but only 8 gluons.\n\nIf carefully labeled, you could say that 6 of the gluons are a single color and a single different anti-color.

No single pair correctly represents a gluon, so you have to combine them.\n\nThere are many different ways to combine these three together, and the only difference is the name of the labels.

If you take into account heating and transport besides electricity and you actually calculate the amount of space needed to run a first world country fully on solar panels you get ridiculous numbers, even for 80% efficiency. This is especially true in densly populated regions like parts of Europe or east Asia. \n\nAnother thing to consider is that a grid is a real time energy use system meaning it can't really store energy. Because solar is not a constant energy source you need ridiculous amounts of storage capacity at least two or three orders of magnitude above everything we have today. I don't think lithium-ion batterys will do that job. \nYou also need some form of inertia to be able to match demand and production smoothly which is absolutely necessary for a working grid. Today this job is done by the turbines from coal, oil or nuclear plants. PV does not have any form of inertia. \n\nMaybe in the future the issue can be solved by Power-to-gas. E.g. storing unneeded electricity as gas.

The drum in the middle causes the liquid to rotate, but it does so in a state called laminar flow meaning there\u2019s no turbulence that would mess up the liquid. As the drum rotates it pulls the closest layer of liquid with it, which drags along the next layer of liquid, and the next, and so on. This makes the dyed liquid spread around, but it only does it in layers. When he turns it the other direction the exact same thing happens in reverse, moving the dye to generally the same position it started in. Of course there is a small amount of error that makes the dye move around, so if you stirred it long enough it would mix."}, {"comment_id": "e64x6gx", "post_id": "9gl09h", "comment": "This works because of [Laminar Flow ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laminar_flow). \n\nIf you mix a cup of water + dye with a spoon, the flow is turbulent. This means that if you track the motion of individual dye particles, it is chaotic. Very close-by particles will likely end up very far apart after stirring. This means the process is very hard to reverse. Essentially, once entropy rises, it's very hard to get it to decrease again.\n\nIn laminar flow, there isn't much mixing. Nearby particles of dye tend to stay close to each other, and they move in a predictable way (in this case, staying in the same cylindrical shell, and being smeared out). This means reversing the process is easy: if you approximately reverse the forces you applied, the flow will approximately reverse. This is not the case for turbulent flow, where a small deviation in the forces you apply would  lead to a huge deviation in where the particles end up."}, {"comment_id": "e651zle", "post_id": "9gl09h", "comment": "Check out [\"life at low Reynolds number\"](https://science.curie.fr/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Purcell_life_at_low_reynolds_number_1977.pdf) "}, {"comment_id": "e659z87", "post_id": "9gl09h", "comment": "Laminar flows are time-reversible due to the absence of the non-linear term in the Navier-Stokes equations (that is the convection term).

Eventually, you spin the drum in the opposite direction fast enough and it appears as though the ink blob is moving in a particular direction as the blobs constitute and spread out - what Bohm calls \u201cexplicate order\u201d (something scientifically measurable).
