If neurons (especially in brain for higher level functions) go too long without oxygen (which is needed to accept the final electrons from ETC and thus produce optimal ATP or energy), these cells die.\nSo without a heart to constantly fuel the fish\u2019s brain, they start to die. However, there are reflex arcs that connect muscles to only neurons in the spinal cord (rather than to the brain). After death (and brain dead), a muscle in the fish\u2019s mouth is being triggered (sensed by a sensory neuron which feeds back to neighboring neurons and eventually to the muscles in question).  The muscle contracts due to lingering amounts of ATP from anaerobic glycolysis and creative phosphate supplies. So I\u2019d say this is more of a reflex than a conscious decision on the fish\u2019s part  to bite the can, since it\u2019s most likely brain dead.

They don\u2019t have a cortex, which is pretty much a necessary condition for consciousness.\n\n1)a Fish are sentient (which means something very different than most sci-fi/pop culture media think it means) in that they have subjective experience. So yes, they feel pain and other things. Whether or not that experience is meaningful without consciousness, or if it is the equivalent of an input-output machine, is philosophical.\n\n2) The response is a reflex triggered from (probably tendrils) by the mouth. Reflexes are non-conscious actions in any creature. The signal travels directly from the activation site, to a ganglia (clusters of nerves) (often in the spine, but in the case of the fish probably straight to special motor areas in the brain. Where it is immediately re-route back to close the jaws.) Reflexes are advantageous for being much faster responses."}, {"comment_id": "eq5mrd1", "post_id": "bxb387", "comment": "It\u2019s like an animatronic.

I wrote a post a while ago about these, which I'll copy a section of here:\n\n> Jellyfish in general all go through a [life cycle involving both polyp and medusa](http://ext.fmkorea.com/files/attach/new/20170131/486263/9279410/572328272/7b3a484190914df592f5140dc056a21c.jpg) phases, which are typically followed by asexual and sexual reproduction respectively.  What is unique about *Turritopsis* is that it has the capacity to [reverse part of this process](http://discovermagazine.com/~/media/Images/Issues/2017/December/ScreenShot20171108at40520PM.jpg?mw=900&mh=600), by transitioning from a medusa directly to a polyp rather than having the polyp develop from a zygote.  Since the part of the life cycle that definitively separates one organism from its offspring is sexual reproduction, this means that a single *Turritopsis* could theoretically just follow this alternate life cycle repeatedly instead (it's a bit more complicated than that since each polyp produces multiple medusae, but whatever).  However, we don't know for sure if they could actually achieve immortality in this way.  This behaviour has only been observed in captivity (originally by [Piraino et al. 1996](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.2307/1543022)), so it is unknown how common it might be in nature or what triggers it.  And furthermore, though I'm just speculating here since as I mentioned it doesn't seem to have been studied in detail, there may be some cost to this process that makes it impossible to keep doing indefinitely. \n\nSo they are kind of immortal in the sense that they can reverse part of their life cycle, but due to the fact that their asexually reproducing stage produces multiple offspring, it's sort of hard to think of this as the same individual that was living before.  And, as I pointed out there, we don't really know if they can keep doing this indefinitely or if instead it might just be some sort of strategy that can be used in response to certain environmental challenges but comes with costs of its own."}, {"comment_id": "f32oi9n", "post_id": "dfd3fp", "comment": "Any Greenland shark fans here?

Lots of cnidarians which reproduce asexually can probably go on living indefinitely.  Common freshwater hydra lineages, for example, have been kept going for decades with no signs of aging, and some coral lineages probably last thousands of years too.\n\nActually I have suspicions that lots of totally obscure and seemingly ordinary invertebrates can live practically forever if nothing happens to kill them.

Elephants, whales, and humans all form multi-generational social groups, which encourages the spread of information deep into an infant's adulthood (new elephant mothers often get scolded by their mothers for example).

The amazon is a big place, and pretty much every time lightning strikes the amazon a fire is started somewhere. yes, the Amazaon has been on fire fore weeks, but that isn't actually noteworthy, as weeks-long fires in the amazon is commonplace.\n\nThe actual new is that over the past year, fire occurrences in the amazon Brazil (Thanks u/aRVAthrowaway) have gone up by 84%. Not just something that has been happening over the past few weeks, but something that has been going on over the past year.\n\n\"Well that makes it even worse! It's been going on for a year now and nobody is talking about it?\"\n\nWell hold your horses there. Fires in the rainforest are monitored via satelite, generally meaning it is the responsability of some government agency to monitor that satelite and let people know when things are off. Well, INPE, Brazil's National Institute for Space Research, does, and did, just that. They compiled all of the satellite data over the past year, and just yesterday published a report declaring that fires have been on the rise over the past year, and by how much.\n\nSo how are we exactly supposed to be able to write an article before yesterday about a report that was only published yesterday? because we shouldn't write a new article about every single fire that happens in the amazon, fires are a natural part of the Amazon's life cycle. What is newsworthy is that those fires are happening way more often than they used to, and we are only going to know that if we compile data and publish a report... like was done yesterday.\n\nedit: I really don't mean to minimize the impact of this report: the fact that fires in brazil have gone up by 86% is a big deal! and we should be talking about it! But we couldn't talk about it before yesterday, because we didn't have the data until yesterday. maybe we SHOULD have gotten that data sooner! I don't know! I'm just saying that it's not like there has been some big scoop that a media conspiracy has keep in the dark untill valiant redditors woke us up.

Hello everyone, I am James and I make [videos about microorganisms](https://www.instagram.com/jam_and_germs/). I thought I can explain what happens in the video better that I was able to 5 months ago when I posted it for the first time on Reddit. This is a *Blepharisma*, a single-celled eukaryote and it's dying. It's death was quite unique, I spend a lot of time looking through a microscope but I've never seen an organism dying like this. I often see cells are getting swollen due to osmotic pressure changes and \"exploding\" eventually. But in this case *Blepharisma* was literally melted away. First time when the cell membrane gets melted it manages to repair itself and swims around with the beating of hair-like structures called \"cilia\" but when it happens for the second time it simple vanishes into nothingness. Things that scattered around after the dead of the cell are mostly something called \"food vacuoles\", these are tiny membrane bound packages of bacteria which were being digested by the cell at the moment. *Blepharisma* is a light-sensitive organism and it avoids light and under certain intensity of light conditions it can go show apoptosis-like cell death. Apoptosis is a programmed cell death, basically cells commit suicide and it plays an essential role in the development of multicellular organisms. However, recent studies indicate that programmed cell death is also present in unicellular eukaryotes. It's quite interesting for a single-celled organism to commit suicide in evolutionary perspective and also fascinating! Also there is a research paper about apoptosis like cell death in [*Blepharisma japonicum*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/j.cellbi.2009.04.007) it says... \"The unicellular eukaryote, Blepharisma japonicum, is a light\u2010sensitive ciliated protozoa. It possesses a photoreceptor pigment called blepharismin that plays critical roles in defensive behavior against predators and step\u2010up photophobic response. In addition, the pigment generates reactive oxygen species such as singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals which contribute to photodynamic action. Previous studies reported that intense light (>300 W m\u22122) induced rapid photodynamic killing (necrosis) characterized by cell swelling and plasma efflux, while moderate light (3\u201330 W m\u22122) only induced pigment extrusion and photooxidation. We have found that moderate light (5 W m\u22122) induced apoptosis\u2010like cell death. Microscopically it was found that >3 h of moderate light irradiation induced macronuclear condensation and plasma efflux without cell swelling. Single cell gel electrophoresis assay showed that DNA fragmentation occurred between 1 and 3 h of irradiation, and the condensed macronuclei contained quite fragmented DNA. Macronuclear DNA extracted from light\u2010irradiated cells contained DNA fragments of 180\u2013200 and 360\u2013400 bp, which were seen as apoptosis ladders.\""}, {"comment_id": "eohnorv", "post_id": "brxumh", "comment": "Man those cilia are not giving up!"}, {"comment_id": "eohvmp9", "post_id": "brxumh", "comment": "I always know I got too high when I cry about a single cell organism die.

But this year, I also haven't reared any in partial captivity.\n\nThat being said, if you have non-native annual milkweed plants, get rid of them or at LEAST cut them down to 6 inches around this time of year. They're supposed to migrate in the winter not stay in the same area which they do if host plant is present. This causes the population to become more diseased, because otherwise diseased individuals would die off in migration rather than pass it on to the next generation (disease spores on the scales of female butterflies can fall on eggs).\n\nAnd could you imagine what other less studied insects are going through?

This sugar has carbons that are numbered 1-5 - but the nitrogen group is already numbered, so the sugar is labeled 1'-5' instead.\n\nThe third part is the phosphate group. The sugar and phosphate form the backbone of DNA, the two outer spirals. One phosphate will be bound to the 5' carbon of one sugar, and the 3' of the other. So when an enzyme moves from 5' to 3', what that means is that it passes from the 5' carbon to the 3' carbon of one sugar, then over a phosphate link to the next sugar.

Bacteria have been interacting with viruses for so many billions of years, that the mechanisms involved are almost impossible to believe. \n\nBacteria use something called a   *Restriction-Modification System* (RMS)  as a means to fight viral infection.  A bacterium will take in an invading virus,  modify its DNA, and then send it back into the environment.  The reason it does this is because its progeny will be infected by the modified virus, which was made impotent by its DNA modifications, and then the progeny bacteria will gain an immunity to it.

Although we can observe taxonomic changes  dependent on geographic regions prior to the ~200 year figure I put forward this has more to do with environmental selective pressures than human intervention. \nThe earliest dogs resembled wolves pretty closely and over the course of 30-40,000 years divergent evolution occurred as a result of both artificial selection and natural selection. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "ec9nyqa", "post_id": "a8cy83", "comment": "Maybe not the direct images, but this is basically now it went.

Ground-sections reveal abnormal eggshell proportions, and multiple eggshell layers best interpreted as a multi-layered egg resulting from prolonged oviductal retention. Fragments of the shell membrane and cuticle are both preserved. SEM reveals that the cuticle consists of nanostructures resembling those found in neornithine eggs adapted for infection-prone environments, which are hypothesized to represent the ancestral avian condition. The femur preserves small amounts of probable medullary bone, a tissue found today only in reproductively active female birds. To our knowledge, no other occurrence of Mesozoic medullary bone is associated with indications of reproductive activity, such as a preserved egg, making our identification unique, and strongly supported.\n\nLink to article: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-09259-x"}, {"comment_id": "eiyuve2", "post_id": "b3comk", "comment": "Keep Dave Chappell away from it or it\u2019ll be a baller ass breakfast "}, {"comment_id": "eizck1b", "post_id": "b3comk", "comment": "\"Perfectly preserved \" is a bit of a stretch "}, {"comment_id": "eiytktr", "post_id": "b3comk", "comment": "Sound's like the plot of a Jurassic World spin-off"}, {"comment_id": "eiyrgkx", "post_id": "b3comk", "comment": "That's amazing!

I make [videos](https://www.instagram.com/jam_and_germs/) of microscopic organisms, I posted a video on r/Biology 6 months ago about a dying single-celled organism and all of a sudden it was on the front page of Reddit then my video got the attention of someone quite remarkable to me... Do you know CrashCourse or SciShow on YouTube? These channels are my favorite things to watch on the internet. I've been following CrashCourse for the last 7 years and probably watched everything they uploaded. And one night I received an email from the creator of these channels, Hank Green, about the possibility of a new channel featuring my beautiful little microorganisms! Well, I teared up a bit when I see his name, sent a message to my best friend who I watched many episodes of Hank Green's work together and my best friend answered all in caps; \"HOLY SHIT!\" \ud83d\ude02 That summarized everything! Since then we created a breathtaking video series to introduce you people to the wonders of the microscopic world. We were working on these episodes for the last couple of months and we aired our very first episode the other day. Please let me know what you think about this brand new channel, [\"Journey to the Microcosmos\"](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBbnbBWJtwsf0jLGUwX5Q3g).
