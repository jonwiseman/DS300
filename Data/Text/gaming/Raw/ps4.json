He asks me if he can kick his soccer ball through my little side window that I sell out of front the other side of the park, would I give him free ice cream?

I gave him 3 tries.\nThe first kick hit the back tire of the truck. The second kick sails way over. It takes a while for the third kick because the kid now has to run and retrieve the ball.

Like Auto Royale the players can't leave the vehicles but have the vehicles be large enough so players can move around inside and climb on top of it. You and your team can switch positions within the vehicle any time (including who is driving) and can use the vehicle itself as cover if needed. Of course, if the vehicle takes damage that cover can be destroyed (car door being shot off, roof being ripped out, etc).\n\nTo open up the possibility for battle passes, the players are basically minions of the main contestants in the series. Kinda like how in comics the villains like Joker have their own posse styled after them. This means a wide variety of cosmetics can be designed (so all sorts of different evil clown getups for the Sweet Tooth theme).\n\nThe vehicles of course will be the usual. The ice cream truck, the tank, etc. Each has its own unqiue topography and so has different types of cover to use and how you move around inside and on top of it.\n\nEach vehicle could be tricked out with its own distinctive gadgets. For example, the ice cream truck could have a minigun at the rear (providing cover but limited range of fire) and a grenade launcher at the front on top of the truck (more range but little cover and have to be precise).\n\nRunning into crates drops standard weapons for the players to use within the vehicle. Talking pistols, semi autos, etc. But of course this could be a good opportunity to design more unique standard weaponry, styled after the main contestants of the series.\n\nYou can win by either outright destroying the opposing vehicles or killing the teams inside those vehicles.\n\nOf course, targeting individual players means a smaller target to shoot than the vehicle itself but the advantage to killing the players themselves is you can scrap the intact left over vehicle to repair your own."}, {"comment_id": "egjptwf", "post_id": "aqyx27", "comment": "Its not like its been missing - the last couple attempts have been really lack lucker and they just didnt have the same feel. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut two things i really miss - Burnout with take down races and Twisted metal "}, {"comment_id": "egjpyg1", "post_id": "aqyx27", "comment": "Carmageddon *cough*"}, {"comment_id": "egjq0ks", "post_id": "aqyx27", "comment": "Anyone remember Vigilante 8?

What\u2019s the point of having stealth in the game if the enemy can just spawn behind you and ruin any possible strategy you concocted!? Stealth gameplay requires you to understand how many enemies there are, what paths they take, what order to take them down in, and possible cover in case something goes wrong. All of that goes out the fucking window of ENEMIES CAN POP INTO EXISTENCE OUT OF NOWHERE. \n2) If I\u2019m fishing, just turn it off.

Everything else worked fineCarried this on for a full 2 hours getting increasingly frustrated at buying a shiny new piece of kit and it not working out of the box.\n\nIt was my birthday weekend and i received the PS4 on the Friday morning - I was due to go away for the weekend with my girlfriend on the afternoon until the following Sunday. Cue me being royally pissed off for the next 48 hours at this PS4 which wasn't working correctly out of the box.\n\nWe get home on the Sunday afternoon and I went in and tried it again. Still getting the disc read error. I called the customer service department from where I got it from and arranged a swap. A little later that evening my mate came round to wish ma happy birthday and I'm looking glum for obvious reasons. He asked me what's going on and so I proceeded to tell him about my stupid PS4. He asks if he can take a look - sure, no worries, go for it.\n\nHe just stood and looked at it for a sec and said \"I think I've solved your problem - your PS4 is upside down mate. No wonder it won't read any discs.\"\n\nI turn it over and there's the white light right down the middle - there's the first giveaway. Put the disc in and it reads first time no issues. Has worked fine ever since and I've had it nearly 5 years now.\n\nI am that dickhead.\n\nEdit: Wow thanks for the silver. Makes the idiocy worthwhile :)\n\nto answer a couple of questions:\n\n1) Yes i did call to cancel the swap.... no I didn't tell the truth haha I just said it was mysteriously sorted\n\n2) Yes I did see how it looked on the box, and in the flesh (or the plastic, whichever), and in pictures etc. I was so excited about getting it I just took it straight out of the box and rammed it under the tv so I could possibly get a couple of hours in before I had to leave for the weekend. Didn't bother to actually look or step back and assess the situation. I pretty much went in to \"I've been sold a fucked PS4\" mode.\n\nYes I am a proper dick and yes, I could have done with a this side up sticker on it.

Obviously spoilers ahead if you haven't finished part one.\n\nThe Fireflies were still powerful and fairly well manned after the events of the first game. They've come back for vengeance after what Joel did to their headquarters and killing Marlene as well as numerous Firefly members. They probably invaded Jackson, and while Tommy, Joel, and the community put up a fight, they eventually got overrun. Ellie obviously survives and is still unaware of the truth. \n\nThe game then goes on her story of righteous vengeance only for her to eventually learn the true actions of what Joel did back in Salt Lake City. Due to the cordyceps still being in her brain after all these years, we finally see symptoms of it when she hallucinates Joel still being there every step of the way on her journey. How she handles the truth(both of Joel's actions and the first signs of her worsening conditions) and what she does with it will probably be the ultimate culmination of the game.\n\nIf Naughty Dog really does go this way, and again it's a random ass theory from a random ass guy on the internet, I don't see how they can possibly continue the series after that. Personally, I was always in the camp of people who wanted a sequel but one that further explored the in game universe without Joel and Ellie as the main characters as I really and truly felt their story was done.\n\nBut now thinking about it, that was never possible as Ellie's situation was too powerful and important for said in game universe to never finish her story.\n\n*edited for grammar and threw in the part of why Joel was in the trailer"}, {"comment_id": "darj0d4", "post_id": "5gb59e", "comment": "YEEEAAAAAHHHHHH BOOOOOOIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII"}, {"comment_id": "darlplh", "post_id": "5gb59e", "comment": "There is a picture of her pregnant in U4.

Sony pretty much took away your account and took away your digital purchases, but they can\u2019t take away hard copies. I know digital is more convenient because you don\u2019t have to swap disks, but I feel it\u2019s always best to have hard copies.\n\nI hope you get your account back.

Forget about calling all the supports, reps and supervisors, they don't care about you. Instead, contact all the gaming news network, big gaming youtubers etc and have them report your story.

Trust me, it is 100% possible for them to change your username and keep all the stuffs you bought, maybe even extremely easily, but they just don't want to bother since they don't care about the problem of just one guy.

It\u2019s a highly emotional story with complex themes that befit the world of The Last of Us. **What we realized pretty early on is that we were putting together Naughty Dog\u2019s most ambitious and longest game in our 35 year history.** To tell this kind of story the game needed to be massive.

They are the big player and all the casual players I know from work chose their console solely on what their friends are playing on. With the overwhelming numbers of the PS4 it's more likely that such a potential customer would chose a PS4 over a Xbox because the chances are higher that his friends have a PS4 too. That's unlucky for us players but there is a clear financial reason behind Sony's decision.\n\nBut there seem to be some other limitations to the cross-play as enforced by Sony that I don't quite get. I never bought something on an Epic account so I'm not sure how this works. Do you buy ingame items via Epics own online store (ie. are you directed to a Epic storefront when you buy something in Fortnite) or are you buying ingame currency via the console's store (ie. PSN Store, Eshop)? If the latter is true I could see why Sony would be against this. For every purchase a player makes on one of the online stores the stores owner takes a bite of the pie. So, if Sony weren't to block this somehow there is a scenario where a player could spent all their money on Fortnite in the Nintendo store, while gaining all the items on the PS4 without Sony seeing a dime of the money. I can see their reasoning for blocking this. \n\nThe problem seems to me more that their approach is very heavy handed and poorly executed. The marketing money they have to put now into damage control must outweight the amount of money it would have took to negotiate a solution with Epic where people can use their Epic accounts wherever they want and use only PS4 bought items on the PS4. This would still be a very user unfriendly solution but at least it wouldn't be this unreasonable clusterfuck they have now.\n\nAlso Sony - if you are listening- , sometimes doing something that's good for the customer even though you might loose some potential money is better for you in the long run. Just look at how you have won this console generation before the first game was even shown by simply posting a short video showing how games can be shared on PS4. Never underestimate the brand loyalty some goodwill can garner."}, {"comment_id": "e0nphqr", "post_id": "8qryj7", "comment": "So what\u2019s the big deal about making a separate account for whatever other system you\u2019re trying to play on?

With otherworldly creatures plaguing the landscape, and mass extinction imminent, it\u2019s up to Sam Porter Bridges to travel across the ravaged wasteland and save humanity from impending annihilation.\n\n> **Face unique challenges**  \n  \n> Arm yourself and take aim at a variety of objectives in your mission to reunite a broken nation, while balancing under the weight of your cargo as you travel. Protect your supplies from wild bandits, and stay safe from the terrifying **Beached Things**\u2026 or face failing those who depend on you.\n\n> **Death is not the end**  \n  \n> There is no traditional \u2018game over\u2019 state in Death Stranding. Lose your life during combat and you\u2019ll find yourself in an upside-down realm, searching for a way back to the living. Choose your combat methods carefully, as killing your foe is almost never the solution \u2013 and every death carries a consequence\n\n> **Assist other players**  \n  \n> Help other travellers without ever crossing paths via asynchronous online gameplay.

I doubt Bungie has the capital that they will need to market D3 to the levels that they will need, which means seeking investment from elsewhere. Could be a billionaire benefactor that's happy to let Bungie do what they want. Or it might be EA who might pull as many strings as they can. \n\nI also don't believe that Activision was the source for Destiny's problems. D1 really struggled as the tools that they were using and the pipeline was almost barbaric. Tiny changes to insignificant parts of the game would take almost full day before they could see the change in game. As a company I would have invested a lot of time and money to make a better development environment for D2. They did a little but no were near the amount they should have. Plus D2 had the same issues that D1 did during development. Things like restarting the project (multiple times?) during development.

Every decision they made after that pushed the game downhill. Sticking with outdated tech to develop the game, trying to push out O\u2019Donnel for calling out Activision\u2019s creative interference. I read that they had the same production issues with Destiny 2 that they had with D1 development. So they really don\u2019t even learn from their own mistakes. The lying about xp and taking their player base for chumps, putting everything behind the cash shop for D2. Sure some things changed but as you can see they did far too much damage to get a \u201cfull core re engagement\u201d. It just paints a picture of a studio that is just crashing along through this project instead of a studio that has some sort of plan. Sure they\u2019ve got a roadmap now but I feel like even that is in jeopardy due to the split with Activision. Who knows how smoothly that will go? I tapped out after COO.

Never looked back but in hindsight if I graded it, I'd give both 9/10, invested a lot of time and enjoyed it. But the way people talk its like they were playing it as if it was a damn MMO or something.

By the time they were ready to distribute the systems, we were TUNED UP and could barely walk straight LOL\n\nLong story short(ish), I went home and was super excited to play. Got to the \"choose PSN ID\" part and felt the immediate dread. This will be with me for awhile, but it's still gotta be funny right? So younger version of me, half in the bag and pretty stoned, decided on something to do with \"The Shocker\" so I chose TuinDapuper. Well if anybody knows The Shocker, it's actually only \"1 in the....\" and not 2 (Tu) so my name has been either impossible to pronounce, or completely interpreted a \"different\" way. I've heard a lot of sexual related slurs, jokes, and comments and my dad wouldn't even accept my friend request because he thought it was \"some gay porn advertisement\".

Can I change my online ID on my PS3 or PS Vita?\n\nNo. The change can only be made through a PS4 system or web browser.\n\nQ: Do I have to pay to change my ID? How much will it cost?\n\nThe first change is free, and changes after that will cost $9.99 USD / CAD. For PlayStation Plus members, it will cost $4.99 USD/ CAD for each change after the first one.\n\nQ: Will my friends be able to find me with my new online ID?\n\nWhen changing your online ID, you\u2019ll have the option to display your old ID next to your new ID in your Profile for 30 days. This will make it easier for your friends to notice your ID change. You can only select this option at the time you are changing your online ID.\n\nQ: How many times can I change my ID?\n\nIn general, there are no restrictions to the number of times you can change your online ID.\n\nQ: Can I revert back to my old ID?\n\nYou can as long as the old ID doesn\u2019t violate the Terms of Service. You can revert back to any of your previous IDs by contacting PlayStation Support.\n\nQ. Do I have to pay to revert back to an old ID?\n\nNo, reverting back is free.\n\nQ: What happens to my old online ID? Can someone else take it?\n\nNo, your old online ID is only available to you.\n\nQ: If I change my online ID multiple times, can I revert back to any of my past IDs?\n\nYes, you can revert back to any of your previous online IDs, as long as those IDs do not violate the Terms of Service.\n\nQ: How many times can I revert back to an old ID?\n\nIn general, there are no restrictions to the number of times you can revert your online ID.\n\nQ: Can any account change their online ID?\n\nChild accounts cannot change their online ID.\n\nQ: Do all games support online ID change?\n\nA large majority of the most-played PS4 games that we tested support the feature. We recommend that you check this list of tested games before you make the actual change. PS3 and PS Vita games are not supported.\n\nQ. What do you mean by a game supports the online ID change if it was \u2018originally published\u2019 on or after April 1, 2018?\n\nThe game must have launched for the first time on or after April 1, 2018, to support the online ID change feature. For example, a game that first launched back in 2013 that has since been re-mastered or re-sold as a \u2018complete edition\u2019 in 2018 does not apply.\n\nQ: Why is it that only games published after April 1, 2018 were developed to support online ID change?\n\nGames published after this date were developed using tools that support online ID change at a system level.\n\nQ: Will all PS4 games released in the future support the feature?\n\nAll PS4 games originally published on or after April 1, 2018 have been developed to support the online ID change feature, but we do not guarantee that all games will fully support the feature.\n\nQ: I saw that there are a lot of potential issues and risks associated with changing my online ID. How do I know that I won\u2019t run into these?\n\nWe recommend that you check this list of tested games before you make the actual change. A large majority of the most-played PS4 games that we tested support the feature, and we expect major issues to occur only in a small number of games.\n\nQ: What kind of issues could I potentially run into?\n\nBelow are some of the issues you may encounter. We expect major issues to occur only in a small number of games.\n\nYour previous Online ID may remain visible to you and other players in some areas.\nYou may lose progress within games, including game saved data, leaderboard data, and progress towards Trophies.\nParts of your game and applications may not function properly both online and offline.\nYou may lose access to content (including paid-for content) that you may have acquired for your games including content like add-ons and virtual currency.\n\nQ: What should I do if I encounter an issue by changing my online ID?\n\nIf you experience any issues while playing a game that is not on the list of tested games, we recommend that you revert back to your previous online ID that did not have those issues.

Holy shit, Sony really has done their best to create the best graphical engines it can that really hits a balance in all fields.

So, to actually win a game as a casual player is exceedingly difficult considering you have one chance at beating that better player, if they outplay you, start over from square 1. Compare this to, for example, COD, where most console shooters began. There\u2019s 6 enemies, the chances of 1 or more being exceedingly better than you is low. Even if there is, when you inevitably get shot by that guy, who cares, the game doesn\u2019t end, maybe you get loss in the game, but you\u2019re playing the game until it ends, you can avoid the good player or you can run classes to try and counter him. \n\nI think skill based matchmaking would help alleviate this problem, but I can\u2019t imagine implementing that into 60 person games would be easy, and it would mean much longer queue times.

The textures are so real. \n\nI really like the direction you went with in making his beard look well groomed. It's interesting to think about the character depth if he were to secretly care about looking good and being well groomed.\n\nWhat I also love is how you made the edging on his cheeks not quite so perfectly symmetrical. The left side is a little deeper V than the right. This may seem like a mistake, but it's so realistic. As a guy with a large beard much like this, I can tell you that trying to get that cheek edging to be the same angle/depth on each side is the hardest god damned part about grooming.

It also looks like you're using that same softer, textured paper that I've been using.\n\nThat presents a kind of weird situation where you can kind of use the texture of the paper to create skin texture, but you also have to draw it at that level of detail or else it will kind of look weird. Basically it makes the texture of his skin looks flat. If the skin has less texture it would look great, but because the paper is textured that much your eye looks for more detail than it normally would. \n\nSo, what I've found to really help with that is to simply give it the texture in his skin a bit more depth, which you can accomplish by drawing it as if it were in a harder, more directional light, make the highlights lighter and your shadows a bit darker. But the biggest thing I can see that I would change is to make the age lines/scars a lot darker in their shadows. That will imply a depth that matches the texture.

I'm not quite sure how select PS2 games were playable on all PS3s, but it's not really surprising that a PS5 could s/w emulate all of a PS2 given how fast it probably is in comparison.\n\nThe one question is the PS3. The CPU emulation isn't much of a deal, but the emulation of the arrary processing features of the cell processor I thought would be hard to emulate. But I guess it was only time before a multicore x86 processor could the job.

They will keep Halo Infinite a \"Project Scarlett\" console exclusive.

Like for example, swinging into a building you then transition into a wall run. It especially happened when you got low to the ground or a obstacle and you can tell the game just shortens the length of your web to make sure you don\u2019t stop. The game intentionally makes sure you never lose momentum and that was a purposeful choice by the devs.\n\nThing is, as I played the game and got better, those initial feelings went away. I thought about it and it felt like those systems were more like training wheels if anything so that new players still felt like spider man. I was speeding through New York after awhile and I built a technique of just starting a swing but quickly ending it which brought me low and I\u2019ll throw zip to points in to launches. I knew swinging was slower to zip to point but I simply didn\u2019t want to stop swinging.\n\nLike with any game I play, I purposefully tried to not stick with one combo or gadget to kill an enemy. I always changed it up and FUCKING HELL did the game ever reward me for doing that. The combat was so fun when you got really good with it. So many awesome moments! I can\u2019t even begin to describe how awesome it felt. The air yanks to yank downs. To throwing enemies into each other. There was one move I didn\u2019t use often but later on in the game I incorporated it was the one where you hit an enemy once then held the web attack button to then pull the enemy in, spider man used his two feet to then throw that enemy forward instead of swinging them around. I especially loved the happy accidents with that move early on when I tossed enemies off with that move off rooftops. Later on I started doing it more on purpose lol.\n\nMy only complaint with the combat is that I wish I could press one button to switch gadgets on the fly. Through ALL of the gadgets. Yes there is the double tapping option to switch between two gadgets you\u2019ve used but I disliked to having to switch within the wheel for something I hadn\u2019t used recently. That\u2019s my only issue. It really stopped my flow a bit but I insisted on using every gadget.\n\nFurthermore, I actually loved the story. I played the game non-stop so that\u2019s perhaps why I got so invested but damn that ending tho... got me in my feels.\n\nOn top of the story it was nice when the little side stuff were fun and different too. Hell I really loved the landmark ones just because it allowed me to swing mid air and take photos on the fly. I don\u2019t get why that was as fun as it was. That and the pigeons and drone task challenges. Those allowed you to use swinging in a more advanced way because you had to be fast and accurate(for the drones). In the story most missions didn\u2019t have you swinging a lot. Unless it was the Scorpion mission with the hallucination. Or the boss fights. I especially loved the fight with Electro and Vulture. Fucking epic just having to stay in the air the whole time. \n\nOverall, I loved my experience. The game far exceeded my expectations and I was sad when it was over. I think I might do a new game plus when I finish God of War."}, {"comment_id": "ererjyc", "post_id": "c1mraw", "comment": "I kept dying at this point and it was still effectively the tutorial!

They all need to be paid, and they're most likely being outsourced anyways, so that's another set of bills to pay; your assembly line workers, the janitors, bosses/CEOs, building rental, electricity, heating, parking, taxes, etc etc etc.\n\nThat 80$ physical copy is actually much cheaper than the 80$ digital copy because you're getting all the outcome of the physical steps of manufacturing the game at the same price as the all-digital actual game.\n\nTL;DR: people need to eat and live for you to get your games, stop bitching."}, {"comment_id": "e7vdsik", "post_id": "9ones4", "comment": "I don\u2019t mind paying the same/extra for the convenience of not having to get up and change a disc every time I play a different game & being able to game share with friends whenever I want.

Your enjoyment of the game does not change depending on whether the 0s and 1s that make up the game were downloaded or came on a disc. If that experience is worth $60 or more to you, then buy the game. If not, don't.\n\nIf you've decided to buy the game, there are pros and cons to the two different delivery mechanisms. For downloadable games, you don't have to worry about losing or scratching the disc. You also don't have to worry about getting up off the couch every time you want to switch to a different game. For retail games, you don't have to worry about the system no longer allowing you to access the game you bought years later. You also don't have to worry as much about hard drive space.\n\nIf your argument is that the price of a game should be tied to what it cost to produce it, well first of all, most economists would disagree with you. But if you go down that route, you should recognize that the cost of producing and distributing the disc is not that substantial compared to the actual development and marketing costs.\n\nI believe the argument you're trying to make is that there is a difference in margins between physical copies and digital downloads. The producer of a physical copy nets about 50% of the retailer price but 70% of the digital price. Are you arguing that the publisher should lock their margin to 50% and to the extent there is more margin to had, that should be used to reduce the price of digital downloads?\n\nLet me ask you this: Let's say you just spent [$265 million dollars](http://www.vulture.com/2018/10/the-making-of-rockstar-games-red-dead-redemption-2.html) making a game, and about the same amount on marketing. So before you've sold a single copy, you've sunk $530,000,000 into this game. You can make $30/copy retail or $42/copy digitally.

Only did it when I resumed the game via rest mode. Also only ever affected that one particular game. \n\nI was fairly lucky in that my system never fully bricked. Gave me a mini heart attack, but never a brick to the face. \n\nIf you don't mind me asking, are you using a PS4 Pro? \n\nAnyway. Typically, a game shouldn't be able to completely brick your system, at least not on a hardware level. If Anthem is truly causing a hardware failure in what would otherwise be a perfectly conditioned system, I believe this would be the first time in history that something like this has happened. My best guess is that the systems that are failing were on the brink of a hardware failure already, and Anthem just so happened to be the one game that pushed the system (likely PSU) to the breaking point. So basically, the game wasn't the cause of the hardware failure, as the hardware was already failing. The demanding nature of the game simply sped up the process. \n\nThe other possibility (like in my case with RDR2) is that the game \"broke\" the OS, which caused a fatal error, and the system to shutdown or reboot. This can almost always be fixed by reinstalling the operating system, or putting a new hard drive into the system. \n\nSo yeah, my best guess is basically the first option. Especially if your console doesn't even power up, or show any indications of power going into the unit. (fans spinning up, lights turning on)\nWhile it sucks that this happened to you and many others, a game cannot cause a hardware failure, and Anthem wasn't the reason for your PS4 to brick. If that were the case, every single Anthem player would be having the exact same problem. \n\nAnyway, I know this really wasn't what you wanted to hear, but it seems like you've already tried every troubleshooting suggestion available to you. If it doesn't boot, and there's no power to the system at all, then you'll need to open an RMA request with Sony to get it repaired or replaced. Even though Anthem itself wasn't what caused the hardware to fail, there's almost no doubt that the hardware has indeed failed. \n\nBest of luck, mate! Also, while I doubt Sony will actually waive the RMA fees, if the problem gets big enough (ie. a bunch of major outlets report it, pressuring Sony) you might be able to get some kind of discount or credit towards your repair.

Ever.  \nThe system software is there to allow only safe operations, and I believe it does so pretty well.\n\nHowever, a PS4 is just another electronic device. A pretty complicated one, too, so there's a lot of room for parts to break.  \nSo any of the parts of your PS4 has a chance of breaking today, every day. In turn, this means that there is an overall chance of your PS4 breaking today, because most users cannot do (or won't do) more than swapping the hard drive. However, as there aren't any huge deficits in the console's design, this number is still very low.\n\n  \nWhat *can* happen though is that some games put more strain on the console than others, and therefore increase these numbers slightly. Therefore, more people will pop up with their console breaking while playing such a game. Also, Anthem and EA already have a shit ton of bad press already, so people will more easily jump to the conclusion that the game is to blame.  \nBut unfortunately, it has to do next to nothing with the game. It's a sad truth that in many of these cases, it's nothing but bad luck.  \n\n\nThinking back, it was pretty much the same with The Last of Us on PS3. Naughty Dog made a game that really put some strain on everyones' PS3s, and a lot of the consoles - especially the old fat models - broke down. Not because of the game per se, but the consoles had a design flaw and were already in the process of dying. Meaning it would most probably have happened anyway, maybe a bit later with a different game, but definitely not weeks or months later.\n\nAs your console cannot be powered on anymore, it's clear that your problem goes beyond the hard drive.  \nMay \"just\" be the power supply unit, but may also be a broken motherboard. You cannot know for sure which part is broken until you begin to swap out parts with working ones one-by-one. So it might happen that you have to buy several replacement parts if you decided to try to repair it on your own.\n\nAlso, in case a certain part is broken (I believe it's the main unit, but I'm not sure), then the data on your hard drive will be effectively lost as well, because the hard drive is encrypted, and the encryption key is unique to your PS4 and stored *somewhere* outside of the hard drive itself.\n\nI'm sorry I cannot help you in the end. I just want to shed a bit of light on the situation.  \nYou already know that your console needs repair or even replacement, depending on the extent of the damage.  \nSo even if it's painful, I have to say Sony's support are right, and are doing all they can for you, which is offering to repair it. Finding out the exact cause of what happened might even be impossible without detailed knowledge of the hardware, so all that most of us can say is that consoles can break just like cars or washing machines. But it's not the game that caused it directly.\n\n  \nYou might want to look for cheaper repair options, or might even want to look for used and/or refurbished consoles, depending on how much you are able to spend.\n\nBut I'm afraid that there is very little chance that your console will just magically work again in a couple of days :/"}, {"comment_id": "ehu48h7", "post_id": "axi1jx", "comment": "The games so shit your ps4 decided to kill itself."}, {"comment_id": "ehu1bin", "post_id": "axi1jx", "comment": "Have you tried power cycling it?

Thank you very much for the warning.\n\nHonestly I've been getting really pissed off at dickheads in the media spoiling the game like this. They assume that we all have played and remember  every detail of RDR 1 so they use that as excuse to spoil this game.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe fact that they would spoil story details in a GRAPHICS video is even more unforgivable.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis reminds me of the fact that DF is not my favorite creator of this type of video. It's another reason why I truly cannot recommend NXGamer on youtube enough. He is not getting the recognition he deserves on youtube at all, despite being arguably better than Digital Foundry despite being so much smaller, if not at least more informed considering he's a game developer himself. He does similar graphical analysis and comparison videos, he's extremely well spoken, informative, less opinionated than DF (seriously if I hear DF spend an entire video complaining about frame pacing one more time...) and I like the way he edits his videos. And unlike DF he doesn't spoil games for people.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSeriously guys, if you're at all interested in Digital Foundry's videos, please give NXGamer a subscribe. Frankly I'm sick of seeing him not getting a fraction of the support DF gets despite being an amazing alternative to them. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI love Digital Foundry too, especially their deep dives into games and series vs their comparisons, but I personally prefer NXG overall. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere's his channel, I can't recommend it enough for those of you who are interested in the type of videos DF does-  [https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Jo0VTzeyYbZ8cVk3k-EhA?&ab\\_channel=NXGamer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7Jo0VTzeyYbZ8cVk3k-EhA?&ab_channel=NXGamer)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSPOILER ALERT-\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPersonally I had no idea that Dutch was in RDR 1. I had completely forgot til one of DF's videos spoiled it for me completely. I had no idea Dutch goes nuts and ends up hating the rest of the gang or whatever. So thanks a lot for spoiling big story details on a GRAPHICS ANALYSIS VIDEO DF\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;"}]
