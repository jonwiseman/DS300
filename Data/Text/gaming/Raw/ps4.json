I've since gone ahead and got the enjoy many Sony exclusives that I had missed throughout the years because of not owning a PS3 and found all of them really good.

If you switched off all the HUD elements, the game didn't still work but worked *even better*.  Everything you needed a UI for was telegraphed in-game (shivering for cold, dizzy for hot, actually making more noise to signify sound) but best of all, you actually engaged in the world around you, using climbing and height to scan the environment and paragliding down to the areas themselves.  And it also made you much more engaged with the conversations you had with people.\n\nWorking in the industry myself, I'm of the opinion that so many tacked on HUD element are a failure on the part of the designers to not be able to convey that information in a better, more intuitive way.  More bars, gauges, maps, blinking points, etc. cluttering the screen are just lazy solutions.  And the worst games are the ones that offer you the illusion of choice of turning it off, when in reality, there's no corresponding gameplay element to get the information you needed anyway; turning these things off ends up handicapping you *at best*.\n\nWhich is why I appreciated BotW's Pro HUD mode so much; it actually improved the game immensely, not just by cleaning the screen up but making the gameplay elements shine that much  more.\n\nThe fact that open-world game makers are finally waking up to this, and in Rockstar's case, fully embracing it, makes me optimistic for the future of this genre of games."}, {"comment_id": "e7f71g0", "post_id": "9mjnxw", "comment": "Ok c'est epique"}, {"comment_id": "e7fcirz", "post_id": "9mjnxw", "comment": "Assassin's Creed Odyssey does something similar, it doesn't give you a marker but tells you generally where to find something"}, {"comment_id": "e7fa917", "post_id": "9mjnxw", "comment": "My favorite part of Morrowind, I was sad when Elder Scrolls adopted the fucking waypoint.

Always have been. Learned everything I could about the series, and it's development throughout the years. \n\nThat being said, I've seen opinions about the most recent entry that vary wildly from, \"best reboot ever\" to \"absolute garbage\"\n\nI fall firmly in the latter category. \n\nThe gameplay itself isn't bad, the campaign however, is the absolute worst thing I've ever played from a TM game thus far. Only three endings? Weak. \n\nThe stories were so weak and poorly written. Nothing stayed true to the character's history. I can understand that they were trying something new but it just didn't work. \n\nHow does Mr. Grimm go from being the literal Grim Reaper or a PTSD having Vietnam Veteran cannibal to some guy with some wack ass looking face paint. I mean the previous iterations were badass! The Grim Reaper variant had that late 90's edgy thing going on where all he wants is to consume the souls of the millions slain as a result of his wish or the Black variant who wanted revenge on the general who made him EAT HIS DEAD BEST FRIEND TO SURVIVE. The goal of the latest iteration of the character was just so fucking lame. \"I wanna save my dad.\" That's it, nothing more. In traditional TM fashion his wish gets screwed up. \n\nThen there's Dollface. A character not initially driven by vengeance, greed, or bloodlust. She was driven by sadness, a desperate eagerness to escape the cage of a mask that now has become a part of her. The initial conflict she had with killing the man who imprisoned her in the porcelain mask she now called home. They reduced her to nothing more than a model only driven by jealousy. I don't really have much to say on the latest iteration of Dollface, her story is just uninteresting and boring. \n\nAnd finally Sweet Tooth. The legend himself, the face of the series. A ruthless killer driven only by bloodlust and the will to kill. The absolute joy murder brings him, the effort he puts into killing, the pride it brings him to see just how much blood he has shed. The fact that there really isn't a motive behind his homicidal ways makes him one of the most terrifying characters in the series. He only exists to kill. Even in TM2 he's just insane. He becomes a bug and lives in a garden where he keeps killing, other bugs that is. \n\nBut what bothers me the most about how they treated the latest iteration of Sweet Tooth was his ending. \n\n**SPOILERS**\n\nThey kill him, they kill off Sweet Tooth. What the fuck. So when you win the campaign as Sweet Tooth he wishes to go where his daughter is so he can kill her. Oops, turns out daughter killed herself shortly after her whole family was killed. So Calypso puts Sweet Tooth in his daughters coffin with her corpse. And that the end of Sweet Tooth. \n\nBUT WAIT! \n\nTurns out there was a second survivor to the Kane family murders! Sweet Tooth's son! So Charlie Kane decides to take up Sweet Tooth's murderous profession and become Sweet Tooth V2. He does this by digging up his sister's grave, with Sweet Tooth in it, taking his mask, then, he pours gas on his head and lights it on fire. Presto! New Sweet Tooth. Only thing is, THAT'S NOT HOW THE FLAMES WORK. Sweet Tooth's flames are the result of a curse the Preacher out on Sweet Tooth as he was being executed. The flames are LITERALLY THE FLAMES OF HELL. That's why they never go out. He feels the pain every single second he's alive. So Charlie Kane kinda just lit himself on fire. \n\nBUT WAIT THERE'S MORE. \n\nCalypso then raises Sophie Kane from the dead, making her his eternal minion. So now Sweet Tooth's dumbass kids are running around while the man himself is dead. \n\nIt was just disappointing to see what the series had become. To go from the brutal, dark, depressing, atmosphere of Black or the somewhat wackier but still absolutely gnarly endings (see Axel's ending) of TM2 to this. It's just depressing to see. \n\n**smaller knit picks**\n\nI don't like that Sweet Tooth has minions now. At least to me,he's always been a solitary killer. Having another living body around and him letting them live just doesn't fit with his character. A cult admiring him I could kinda get behind but not minions riding shotgun. \n\nPreacher being a background character is eh. After the exposition of him being the one to curse Sweet Tooth in Black I feel like the writers missed an opportunity to make him a more integral part of the lore. \n\nTM3 and 4 are trash. Small Brawl is ok and Head On kinda feels like they were trying to expand on the lore of TM1 and 2 while still introducing some new stuff. \n\n\nSorry for the rant. I just don't like what my beloved Twisted Metal has become. \n\n "}, {"comment_id": "egk5v4s", "post_id": "aqyx27", "comment": "The problem now is that developers see online play as the biggest draw, which was what it focused on and fell flat.

The duplicate data enables it to be found faster to decrease load times, but with a SSD this is not needed as the tech locates the data faster period, so there will be less wasted space and they also said you should be able to choose what data you want to keep, like deleting SP after you beat it but keep MP."}, {"comment_id": "f301q5v", "post_id": "dez1xy", "comment": "> The GPU has been used to power Machine learning.\n\nAnd so it begins."}, {"comment_id": "f2zu208", "post_id": "dez1xy", "comment": "Jason Schreier comments:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1181544879505203200\n\n>Lots of good next-gen details in here.

In fact, this not only makes me rethink my previous position on those games but, [like Greg Miller implied](https://mobile.twitter.com/GameOverGreggy/status/1006598694311944194), it makes me think twice about Sony and the PS brand as a whole if this is what can be expected for the future.  \n  \nI hope Sony changes this policy, even if at least just for this game.
