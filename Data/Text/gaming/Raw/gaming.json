Fuck accepting that they lowered the bar of AAA games so much, that we now sit here 10 years later wondering how much the games will SUCK prerelease instead of wondering how much they will ROCK, like we are supposed to. Fuck sitting around defending someone fucking you over, then going out to buy the game like a mindless drone and then going online to complain about it ad infinitum. Fuck becoming used to these business tactics so much that you become so lazy that you stop thinking for yourself and start letting *them* tell *you* what is acceptable and not the other way around.

What really needs to happen is for E3 to roll around. Let all the video game and console devs do their presentation. Then; when EA steps out, and only when EA steps out, people collectively 'boo' and turn their backs throughout the whole presentation. The only thing gamers can do short of buying absolutely 0 EA games (unlikely) which would tank stocks, is to show them their actions have reached a pinnical of disappointment for their consumers. That gamers wont even be bothered to be aware/present at their biggest yearly exposition.\n\nEdit: even I can't believe THIS is my top rated comment. I always assumed \"RIP inbox\" was a joke.\n\nEdit #2: Ok so since this is still a comment people are latching onto and I have access to my computer now, I guess I should make as few things a little clearer. I know it's all paid-to-clap press. Those people are paid to write 'best in E3 show!' 'Battlefront 2 made me cry!' '#newEAgamelooksdope' bias is part of their resume. 'Yes man' their label. My point is that it would have to get to that moment where even the paid to gold seal 'reporters' have had enough. Sadly, there will never be a universal ban on one publisher. For those who've been in a guild, it's common knowledge gamers rarely will work together for the better of the whole without having their ego stroked as the one. I would assume this applies double for trying to ban a publisher. At this point, all you can do is the single most damaging thing to a major corporation; and that is to tank their stocks. Their PR will kiss shit stained player ass and do it with a smile. That's their job. What we need to start thinking as a whole collective is how to make their stock holders and CEO's start applying rose red lipstick and considering their go-to tongue action move. This means, actively boycotting all their products. Which nobody will do. I'm favor of a comment I saw where someone suggested, as far as Battlefront II was concerned, attack Disney. I agree with u/roxwar. >EA doesnt own star wars, Disney does and if theres one thing Disney absolutely will not tollerate, its bad press surrounding their brand. You want to punish EA? Then you need to take to social media and tag disney in this shitshow and express your disgust at their assosiation with gambling boxes in video games obviously aimed at children.\n\nI'd assume Disney saw the EA stocks and figured they could do no wrong. Disney stopped selling magic and childhood dreams mid-80's. What the fuck do they know about fun and happiness (anybody who points to their theme parks have clearly never stood 4-hours in line for a five minute ride)? That does mean however, we need to stop the cycle of being the industries bitches. Take some fucking responsibility. In many ways; these practices became practical to them because gamers (us) showed them that it was a viable business model. Like paying for a gold subscription on Xbox. DLC that is a few skin changes for guns or characters. Sloppy/shoddy/irrelevant pre-order bonuses. Games that were released buggy because a deadline had to be met (yet are rarely fixed once the cash in comes) If we as gamers want a more responsible publisher and game dev; we must become more responsible consumers of games.

Players are often difficult to anticipate.

She's going to stomp all over major challenges you thought would tax her immensely and then almost get killed by some kobolds. Most of all, she's going to sail past the grand narrative you're trying to tell her and make up her own story instead.\n\nLet her, and help her tell it. If you do that you'll have an amazing time.

Evangelicals have always had a hate-hate relationship with pop culture, but D&D panic became mainstream a little bit due to the general \"Satanic panic\" craze, as well as a specific case with James Dallas Egbert where lawmen incorrectly speculated D & D drove his behavior (a failed suicide attempt.) The old movie Mazes and Monsters is a fictionalized retelling of that case.\n\nThe Satanic Panic in general is something that tends to be forgotten now. People believed that there were cabals of satanists around that abused children and did other nasty things, due to a couple trials that heavily relied on the now discredited idea of repressed memories. This was mostly a secular idea. The meme joke \"show me on the doll where he touched you\" came from this, but was used along with leading questions to get vulnerable kids to confess to being abused in utterly bizarre and false ways. It's something that reads like it was straight out of fiction, but it really happened in the 1980s, and D&D was close enough to get hit in the crossfire from it.\n\nIt happened mostly as a reaction to the rise of mass media and the pretty harsh amount of social change we saw in the 80s. It's actually scarier that it was forgotten so quickly; if you grew up in that time, the fact that people literally thought it existed, and that it shaped pop culture in not a few ways, has always troubled me. It actually affected Christian fundamentalist belief in that it spawned the \"spiritual warfare\" trope and heightened belief in the existence and power of demons to influence people's behavior. A good example of this is in the novel \"This Present Darkness\" by Frank Peretti, which was my generation's Left Behind. And people actually milked this behavior; the Christian comedian Mike Warnke among others actually claimed to be ex satanists of the moral panic variety.\n\nIt's really a cautionary tale of how people act during times of social panic and what can set them off. It's not actually religion alone; religious people opposed the advent of the bar code, for one, and never saw the level of demonization at the secular level we did with D&D. (Though we do have to thank them for really linking bar codes with dehumanization, for example; sometimes religious critique can actually be dead on in emotional tone, while not on facts.) But if secular people on the whole are vulnerable, you get these ideas transmitted widespread.\n\nJust posting this if you think parents forbidding people from playing D&D is solely hyper religious nutcases. A lot of secular people fell for it too, and its too easy to fall into the idea that normal people can't fall prey to moral panic ideas.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "drqlnol", "post_id": "7m13gd", "comment": "Ha nerds"}, {"comment_id": "drqmrm8", "post_id": "7m13gd", "comment": "We'll show them up at the talent competition."}, {"comment_id": "drql8pv", "post_id": "7m13gd", "comment": "Enjoy your time in the [Fires of Hell](https://olddungeonmaster.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/fires-of-hell-5e.pdf), old man."}, {"comment_id": "drqlryg", "post_id": "7m13gd", "comment": "Is this starter set good?

Executives would be falling over themselves rushing to get refunds back up as easy as possible for willing customers.\n\nPeople are scared to call their bank or card company to issue a chargeback. I wouldn't be. As long as you didn't receive a physical product that you're keeping or services rendered & the refund process is a huge pain in the ass, you're fine. Hell, old timers issue chargebacks for software they forgot they ordered all the time. This is much more legitimate -- refund process is too difficult, perfectly valid. What if they required you to dance an Irish jig to get your money back, would you do that, too?\n\nIn fact EA not only loses the sale, they also get charged about $30 by Visa or Mastercard for each chargeback.\n\nEDIT: Upon further reading, a chargeback might get you 'banned' for any existing EA accounts or what-not.

It could be difficult to even figure out what calls cost.\n\nYou could be charged a different rate for: \n\n* Calling someone who lived 5 miles away \n* Calling someone on the other side of town. \n* Calling a business.\n* Calling someone just over a state line.\n* Calling at night or on weekends. \n* Calling on a holiday.\n\n[Here's a \"friendly\" rate chart people could cut out so they could figure out the pricing.](https://i.imgur.com/7dJ7k4q.jpg)\n\nTo add to the fun:\n\n* The first minute was more expensive than the second, so if you got a wrong number and hung up, you paid more. \n* You even had to **rent a telephone** for about $7 a month. That's around $20 adjusted for inflation. We're not talking an iPhone, that bought you a janky plastic rotary dial phone.\n\nCalling someone was an investment. A **single hour long call** to someone 300 miles away at normal rates would cost $20.54- that's over $60 in today's money. \n\nThey were getting ripped off for the exact same reason we're about to get ripped off, the company had too much power, and was not beholden to anyone but regulators. And it was WAY more profitable to own the regulators and milk the consumers. \n\nOur most obvious solution is the same. In 1982 federal action broke up the bell system into smaller competing companies. Within ten years, prices had plummeted. It wasn't long before people would balk at paying more than a dime a minute for a long distance call. Today, the idea of paying for in-country long distance is laughable. \n\nIf we want to stop it, we have to stop it the same way- demand congress break up the cable, internet, TV and wireless carriers, require them to open the lines **we paid for** to other carriers *at cost* so they can compete on an even playing field, and restrict companies from having too wide an influence or ownership over so large an area that it's impossible to compete against them.

In particular, the agency is seeking to roll back the February 26, 2015 reclassification of broadband Internet under Title II of the Communications Act, which treats it as a \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d under the law, and return it to Title I of the Communications Act as an \u201cinformation service.\u201d The FCC will be accepting public comments on the new rule at fcc.gov/comments until July 17, 2017.\n\n   I understand your concerns about telecommunications companies charging additional fees for Internet-based services or blocking service altogether. However, the government must use caution when imposing any new federal mandate on the private sector. In the past, I have opposed rules attempting to enforce network neutrality. The Internet ecosystem is the most vibrant and dynamic sector of our economy and it is important that Congress strike the proper balance between free markets and regulation. I am glad that the FCC has changed course. I also believe that any long-term solution to this issue will need to come from Congress. \n\n   Thank you again for contacting me.

If you care about your internet freedoms\n\n**What is Net Neutrality?**\n \nCurrently, when you access the internet on your computer or mobile device, you get to view websites and watch video at the same speed as everyone else does. You are able to view and load all websites equally, because there are rules in place that require companies like Comcast and AT&T to do so. These are considered net neutrality rules, and because of these rules it prohibits those companies like Comcast and AT&T from throttling or blocking access to certain websites.\n\nThey are trying to change those rules, and when I say change - I mean the FCC is going to vote to appeal these rules in the next month! This is serious, because once it's repealed the flood gates open to let ISPs do charge us for more and more stuff. If you're complaining about how much you pay for internet and cable now, then you better be worried about what will happen if this does get repealed. If Congress gets enough calls, they can stop this. \n\nInstead of treating everyone equally, the Comcasts and AT&Ts of the world are trying to make internet a \"tiered\" level service. You would have to pay to get access or faster loading times on specific websites. For example: Having to pay $10 more a month for YouTube or Facebook access. Think of it like how you pay for cable today. If you want access to channels that aren't available in your plan, you have to pay more."}, {"comment_id": "dq5v2wa", "post_id": "7ek4q6", "comment": "From someone who doesn't know much about this issue: could you just use a proxy if they \"block\" them because you haven't paid for that level of service?
