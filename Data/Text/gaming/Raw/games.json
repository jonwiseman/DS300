I got into the game when I was in junior high/high school, when the game was in Classic/BC. I didn't follow many online gaming news outlets. I mainly just got my news and game releases from my brother, who was out of college. Eventually, though, I got sucked into WoW. I also wanted something more from it. I started finding various communities and websites myself, and I eventually found my way to TotalBiscuit and WoW Radio.\n\nEventually, John left WoW behind, but he was still prominent on other fronts. He was a frontiersman in the young industry of gaming journalism. He never failed to always have a constant stream of content. Did a genuinely good PC game just launch? There was a video about it. Was a game running lower than 60fps? You bet your ass he complained about it. Was a game company acting dishonestly? John was there to breathe down their necks.\n\nThe man moved continents in every community he touched. If you're part of any big community built around a game, he likely touched that game, even for a little bit. He did a lot for League of Legends. He damn near built the SC2 community himself in its early days.\n\nI admit I haven't watched him as much as I used to, but if I was interested in a PC game, I always looked to see what he had to say about it. Hell, I even bought a Switch game (Mario + Rabbids) because of him. I'm scrolling down my Steam collection now. Games that he influenced my purchase of:\n\n* Awesomenauts\n* Banished\n* Bastion\n* Battleblock Theater\n* The Banner Saga\n* Blackguards\n* Blood Bowl\n* Braid\n* Broforce\n* Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons\n* Castle Crashers\n* C'thulhu Saves the World\n* FTL: Faster Than Light (my favorite PC game, also lead me to Into the Breach)\n* Game Dev Tycoon\n* Gunpoint\n* Hatoful Boyfriend\n* Legend of Grimrock (and Legend of Grimrock 2)\n* Magicka (and Magicka 2)\n* Octodad\n* Orcs Must Die\n* Orcs Must Die 2\n* Papers, Please\n* Pillars of Eternity\n* Retro City Rampage\n* Reus\n* Risk of Rain\n* Rogue Legacy\n* Sanctum\n* Space Run\n* SpaceChem\n* The Stanley Parable\n* Sunless Sea\n* Terraria\n* This War of Mine\n* Transistor\n* Transformers: War for Cybertron\n* Transformers: Fall of Cybertron\n* War for the Overworld\n* and, of course, WARHAMMER 40,000: SPACE MARINE\n\nI'd been preparing for the inevitable whenever the news broke at the start of May. I was sad when I saw this tweet, but after going through my Steam list, it hit me hard. I bought 6 shirts to support him after he broke the news. They're getting hella worn over the next couple of weeks. With E3 just around the corner as well, I'm going to really miss his Snarkathon takes on the press conferences.\n\nI'm not a religious person.

He insisted for years that options matter on a platform that actually needs them, because every gamer is different.\n\nWithout him PC gaming would be worse. We are here, because people like him believed in the idea of choice and that people are rational.\n\nHe always stood for the rights of the consumer. The average young men and women who need to make informed decisions on the ever growing gaming market.\n\nHe put ethics before everything else. His phisophy evolved over the years to be as transparent and concise as possible. Even if his tastes didn't align with ours or vice versa, he always explained his stance, which was valuble. Because both perspectives on a matter yield the utlimate truth.\n\nHe made YouTube a better place for video gaming. Back when he started, gaming wasn't the predominant subject of YouTube. But we all saw that change years ago. Gaming in YouTube is hugely important for the industry as a whole and he did his part to ensure that viewers got a fair deal out of it.\n\nHis ethics and constant search of the best format to critique gaming has insipired many to do it as well.\n\nAnd I'm afraid to say there's a huge audience out there right now craving for honest and concise opinion based content. We will never fill the void that's left, but we can learn and grow.\n\nThis very much reminds of Rayn Davis' passing in 2013. 4 years and 2 months almost. TotalBiscuit followed GiantBomb and covered his passing in his Content Patch series. The passion with which he explained Davis' passing made me shed a tear about a website and a person I didn't follow or even knew about.\n\nIt made me pay attention to GB and eventually become a fan. Which eventually prompted me to start playing a small game called Project Reality where I've found life long friends, all because of a chain reaction caused by TB.\n\nI imagine some people will mourn TBs passing the way I did of Rayn Davis - you still feel the loss even if you didn't really follow TB.\n\nRayn Davis was one of the most charming and nicest people in the industry. He passed away prematurelly at the age of 34, very similar to TB. Taken away waay too soon. Waay before they could both come to their prime.\n\nJust like GB, it feels like TB was just starting his career. Just starting to break the big news, make a wider impact, but looking back, he already did way more than 99.99% of us will ever do.\n\nI think more of us should strive to be like TB. Start from pretty much nothing and just shoot for the stars. A lot of effort will be required, but if you don't try, you can't succeed.\n\nAnd to watch him do all of that while battling cancer to the bitter end, staying positive is perhaps something most of couldn't do at all.\n\nHis critique, commentary, advice and ethics will be missed.\n\nRIP BiscuitBear"}, {"comment_id": "dzjb26z", "post_id": "8lwynt", "comment": "> I know writing a comment on the Internet doesn't mean much, but I want to put my piece out there.\n\nYes it does, I love reading through all these comments.

I followed it closely when it was announced just because I thought it had a strong scam vibe behind it. I still don't believe on the longevity of what the dev is offering. A few point in no particular order that I'd like to share:\n\n- This is a Hearthstone clone. If you want more of the same, that'll be this game. The stats of a lot of cards have their counterpart in HS, specially the classic set.\n\n- The game currently have only one card set as far as I know and it has been this way since the game was announced around 1.5 year ago.\n\n- The price, in Ethereum, of the packs have always been fixed but, as you know, its not the case of ETH.\n\n- You can buy different card packs for the single card set. The most costly packs guarantees legendary cards. The price was always fixed at 0.012ETH, 0.075ETH, 0.112ETH and 1ETH **per pack**. At launch, this was equivalent to around $4.80, $30.00, $44.80 and $400 **per pack**. Today the price point is $2.10, $13.13, $19.60 and $175 per pack.\n\n- The dev claims that once a card is sold, it is unique to the blockchain it was sold to and that card can never chance. As in even if the dev decides to balance the card, the version that was sold will never be affected since it is 'in the blockchain' after it is sold. I know I probably butchered that sentence but allow me to make an analogy. Think of buying a pack of card from Hearthstone with your Credit Card. Think of the process. You buy a pack, a unique transaction ID is generated from your bank. What Gods Unchained dev supposedly do is any cards that comes out of that pack of card now have the unique transaction ID imprinted on it. So, in their server, Transaction ID 1234 has Cards X, Y and Z. That's it. People seems to think that, somehow, the transaction ID is now the card since it is easy to convince gullible people it is the case. So, the general belief is that dev will never be able to change a card because it now belongs to the *blockchain* rather than dev holding back from changing the said card *for now*.\n\n- The dev announced a $1.6m tournament at launch. The prize pool is financed by taking a 10% split from all sales of the card packs. Currently the counter is sitting at around $500k. There's no set date, nothing. You just hope that the number displayed on the website is correct and that the dev will honor their promise one day if it ever hit that amount.\n\n- Card packs were sold before there ever was any game. There was literally nothing and the dev was selling card packs. People were buying. Well more like, people were *investing* since most people back then were riding the cryptocurrency craze.\n\n- Naspers, ~~subsidiary of~~ investor in Tencent, invested $15m in this game recently. If you're sleeping under a rock, Tencent is the largest Chinese conglomerate. This bit actually makes the Tweet even more questionable.\n\nFor sure Gods Unchained dev managed to slip just in time for a good exposure by throwing shades at Blizzard but I see people singing the praise of Gods Unchained's dev in here which makes me wonder whether people are even aware what the hell they're even praising in the first place.\n\nEdit: Ugh of course this is sitting at -4 for no apparent reason/post contradicting anything I said.

At the time the UK was spearheading regulation for the EU. Now that the UK is in flux, it looks like the EU is leaving it up to Belgium to take this on. The EU will ban this content, certain large Western companies will try to find ways around it, and the EU will not mess around. They will sanction. \n\n>If you are a regular reader here at Gamasutra, then you've known this was coming for years. Major companies (that don't seem to follow the news) have been acquiring labor assets and equipment to optimize their gambling operations and that means they are going to be even slower to adapt to the changing environment. Sure, your virtual world was a lucrative place to drop a casino, but there are children in your games unless you want to make your games adult only, which I don't know of any gaming company that wants to do that. \n\n>On a personal note, I'm kinda looking forward to playing games again, without having to walk through a casino to get to them.\n\n>The specific game I showed regulators in 2013 at the ICPEN summit was Marvel Super Hero Squad Online, a game made for Disney by Gazillion Entertainment, with overt gambling mechanics (including a roulette wheel) aimed at very young children that may not even be of reading age. As I hinted at last week, I suspect someone tipped Disney off to this ruling in advance and the Disney/Gazillion breakup was damage control, four years late.\n\n>If you look at the link to the VTM article, you will see that European parents are waking up to news reports showing Star Wars Battlefront 2 (with some amazing animation btw) along with the included gambling mechanics and interviews with regulators. This is an amazing amount of free advertising for both Disney and EA, but not the kind they want. This must be catastrophic news for both companies and (as I've been hinting this year) I think you will see that the financial forecasts for both companies were optimistic because they did not anticipate this happening despite it being four years in the making.\n\n>This bewilders me since when I gave my report to the ICPEN in Panama in 2013, the vice president of Disney was sitting three feet from me. I had dinner with her the previous evening. As soon as she was done with her presentation calling for \"industry self-regulation\" (and we can see clearly what that means) the German chief regulator started asking her why there were gambling mechanics in her products for young children and she fled the conference immediately. The writing was on the wall, I don't understand why they waited for the EU to torpedo their product line and brand image.\n\n>When I got back to the USA after the ICPEN summit, I was asked to present at GDC 2014. I was double approved for a talk on children's monetization, the ICPEN summit, and pending regulation. A panel on monetization ethics that I was on was also double approved. Then at the last moment both were cancelled without explanation. People keep asking me why I don't talk at GDC, and this is why. The gaming industry correction I have been warning of is about to double down, but it didn't have to be this way. Even games without gambling mechanics will be affected as parents, media, and legislators begin to demonize our industry and make alternate purchase decisions.\n\nI love how the Disney lady scurried away from the conference after being asked about giving gambling access, already back 2013.

Digital scarcity is an oxymoron, a computer of any type is meant for copying, thus creating fake scarcity and selling it isn't the same as physical goods, which have some theoretical limit on production. \n\n There is no trading on most lootbox content and they're typically consumable/account bound.  Physical goods retain their right of resale where as digital goods are denied this right.\n\nNext, a pack of magic cards cannot be altered by a machine learning algorithm based upon the player (purchaser) feedback.  Lootbox content can create the same ecosystem as modern slot machines giving just the right feedback (small, well timed hits; \"free spins;\" etc.) to keep a user active in the system.  A physical pack of cards cannot do that.\n\nIn most CCGs, every level of rarity has a value.  I am not aware of any single CCG that has all the valuable (in terms of game use) cards in \"chase\" level slot.  However, in lootboxes, particularly cosmetics, all of them are filled with trash tier loot and the most desired items are nearly always the highest level of colleciton. Lootboxes are designed different than a CCG pack as they need people to play with game with limited numbers of packs and not just chase rares. \n\nYou do not have always present, always on, be it in your pocket or in the game environment, push to buy more packs in a CCG.  Whether fondling your collection, building decks, or playing with friends, there is not a giant \"buy more cards! here's a free pack, keep trying!\" flashing around you. The games build an ecosystem around the purchase and/or the games are designed to funnel you into the lootbox process.  This is more seen on mobile currently, but Battlefront 2 was plainly obvious. \n\nIt's getting really long, and we still haven't covered in-game economies, matchmaking based on lootboxes (i.e. Activision's recent patents), and actual gambling like \"CSLoto\".  \n\nDo people gamble with CCG  cards? Yes.  Should they be looked into?  Sure.  But bringing them up against lootboxes is the most tired strawman argument, to a case of \"whataboutism,\" simply because CCG peddlers wish they could have the influence and capabilities a video game lootbox has over their players. Digital goods are significantly different than physical goods; the producers of the former control a great deal more of the variables on how their products are approached, consumed, and provided with incentive.

I may be bad at capturing the specifics, but [this article](https://www.newstatesman.com/sci-tech/2014/03/addiction-art-how-gambling-machines-and-digital-world-put-us-machine-zone), and the subsequent book by  Natasha Dow Sch\u00fcll , *\"Addiction by Design: Machine Gambling in Las Vegas\"*, should be some required reading for gamers to understand why lootboxes are not the same as whatever popular \"What about...?\" they want to compare them towards.  Or some irrational fear that this is a first amendment assault on games (it's not). \n\nWhat is happening is the slow maturation of modern behavioral sciences, developed deeply for addiction by gambling industries, making their way into game technology *because they work and are incredibly effective.*  This isn't knee jerk feels, such as the scare that violent media causes violent delinquency, proven wrong for every media yet available (... how about round 14 for VR?), but based on legitimate science being deployed in gambling industry. \n\nWhen we have upfront companies advertising their services to turn *\"players into payers,\"* they're not selling snake oil, but effective practices that will work on more than just \"weak will addicts,\" and completely overwhelm anyone's self sense of personal will or responsibility; we are all mortal and fallible. \n\nLong gone are the \"crank the handle, win or lose\" of slot design.  Modern design includes constant feedback/reward, learned algorithms to evoke engagement, and \"free spins\" at the opportune rate/time to keep you in among many things.  Video games already have engagement covered, you're paying to be there for retail releases.  The other two are built into how most lootbox platforms, even the seemingly safe ones like Overwatch, to not cause outrage or fuss, but to lull you into thinking they're safe, enjoyable, and fun.  Because that's how they're designed, but at some point, either sooner or later for all but the most determined players, you will be caught at a weaker will moment ([willpower is not unlimited](https://www.wired.com/2012/10/mf-willpower/)), and you will pay. \n\nThese mechanics are not good for anyone.  They have very scary and real concerns should they break into other areas of e-commerce, but in video games alone, they're cause for concern.  We should not allow them to be in front of minors and we should be educating adults on why some of us are so \"butthurt\" about the topic. \n\nWhile some want a full ban, most of use wanted the video game industry to self-regulate from the start.  A push for the ESRB would be great, but that didn't happen.  So now we're contacting our legislators on the matter and it's gaining momentum slowly.  This may push the market to self-regulate, much like the maligned fears over violence years ago, which is a win-win for all.  However, if they do not effectively self-regulate with transparency, then we need to do something and not just sit around.  I care about gaming and games in general, in a wide spectrum.  I don't want them to become something more toxic just for the increase quarterly revenue for major publishers who give two shits less about the medium as art or entertainment, just profits.

Importing content was slow, and didn't scale. Rebuilds sometimes took tens of minutes to complete. Some features were poorly implemented or half-assed due to developers not wanting to wait for dependencies, which led to low performance of those features.\n\nBasically, Bungie didn't get a proper plan in place for how to structure their development and allocate their resources quickly enough, and paid the price with a slightly dodgy engine that from a consumer point of view performs very well, but from a developer point of view is an absolute nightmare to work with.\n\nTheir overall development time for the engine was far slower than intended, and that combined with the low-performance of certain development tools had a knock-on effect that impacted the rest of Destiny *and* Destiny 2's development. It also meant that creating new content was a painfully slow process, because it would mean importing new assets (low-performance feature that never scaled properly) and testing new builds (which take an age to complete). This is what they mean by \"It was too hard to create new content and we just couldn't do it anymore\".\n\nAll this meant they ran out of money because everything went over schedule, so in order to reach Activision's lofty revenue goals and release schedule, they renegotiated to put out smaller content packages and added microtransactions to generate an additional revenue stream. Apparently, even that wasn't enough, because Activision still said that all of Destiny's sales, even Forsaken, which was their best-selling expansion and almost sold as well as the base game, weren't good enough.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTo summarise, if Bungie had properly planned out their engine development, there wouldn't be microtransactions in Destiny and the games would have had significantly more content, because the engine would have been more feature-rich, far easier to work with and have drastically reduced development times.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo, is Bungie at fault? Yes. Is Activision at fault? To a lesser extent, also yes. But not out of some kind of evil intent. It was simply because going into this whole arrangement nobody had any idea everything would go quite so wrong. Hopefully, if they are working on some kind of mobile game with the money from NetEase, it'll give them the time they need to sort out their engine, and by the time we get their next game, be it Destiny 3 or a new IP, they'll be in a much better position to put out some good quality games.\n\nI wouldn't hold out much hope of Destiny 2 changing anytime soon though. That's still running on a crappy engine nobody at Bungie wants to work with right now."}, {"comment_id": "edu9ijf", "post_id": "aenhst", "comment": "Everyone celebrating. \n\nI'm not convinced this is good news. \n\nDevs studios and the habits they inhibit change, we shouldn't just suddenly trust because of their developmental past. \n\nIf Activision wanted their ass out the door and didn't even want the IP that kinda stems something else is going on internally. \n\nTo me, it seems like Activision lost all trust in not only Bungie but the Destiny IP all together. They see no future in it, why else would they cut them loose? \n\nBelieve it or not, these things don't happen for the benefit of the consumer. Bungie did **not** \"fight\" for this.

Why try to corner the market with thin margin hardware (that plays nearly all the same games as your competitor) when you can try to capture the market by software/service (Windows).  Xbox hardware is just a Windows 10 PC anyway.  There isn't a compelling reason to avoid a PC release if hardware isn't main factor in your business model.  Microsoft is trying to make gaming seamless and \"easy\" within any Windows device.  The thought is that it will be so easy that people will find themselves just using it, because they have it (less reason to go buy your competitor's hardware).

I want to see TB live for his sake, and also so that I can see Vijay's smile one more time, on another face.  \n\nEven if none of his weapons work and the cancer wins -and in the end, we're all in the same race to die happy before the cancer can take us- we'll keep fighting and keep trying to claw back days and months from the tumors.  For him and for everyone.  Fuck, my eyes.  \n\nI'll always be there for anyone with cancer, because I owe it to them.  They were forced into *my* fight.  They were conscripted and sent against the most evil, insidious force on earth, with no warning.  Cancer tore apart Vijay's mind and body.  It's merciless.  I hate it.

From what I've gathered, if chemotherapy \"stops working\" doctors will likely prescribe what is called \"comfort care\". At that point, curing the cancer will no longer be a goal, and making the patient comfortable through pain medication and any other means is utilized. \n\nTwo of my family members did become involved with a \"clinical trial\". Unfortunately it sounds a lot more beneficial than it really is. The patient might be prescribed something in a certain way for research purposes that is not the clinical norm; just to see what effects it has. It helps science but it's incredibly unlikely that the research being performed would lead to a reversal of such a late-stage cancer.\n\nThat would signify that this is the end, sadly. It may take months but the pain becomes so much that many patients stop eating and that accelerates the decline as the body becomes severely weak and things start shutting down."}, {"comment_id": "dxou8a1", "post_id": "8ddbjo", "comment": "Good lord.

Dying from cancer is so much worse than other deaths imo. When some family members passed away from things that weren't cancer, they were fairly sudden. You'd go to the funeral and mourn and grieve the person. It's hard but you move on.\n\nBut with cancer, you could mourn the person for years before they even die. You'll get news one day that the cancer is spreading and things are grim. Your relative is no longer responding well to treatments. Doctors estimate they have between 2 and 10 months left. So holy shit, they could be dead in 2 months! You take some time off work, you spend time with them, you worry about them, and there is a lot pain. It hurts a lot more than when someone passes away suddenly. 2 months go by and they are still alive. Maybe you take some more time off work to be with them. Another month goes by and you're constantly worried that today is the day you hear they go to the hospital and only have a couple days to live.\n\nThen you get some news. Some new drug or new treatment is working! Doctors now say your family member could live 1-5 years! You are happy again, at least you know they aren't going to die tomorrow. \n\n3 Months go by then you get more news. Initial treatments were promising, but continued treatments have been less than promising. Doctors think they've got 1-6 months left.\n\nFor me with one of my family members, it's been 5 years now. 5 years after the initial doctor statement that they think he has a couple weeks to 3 months left. His cancer is god awful, it's spread through his entire body and the doctors don't even see a point in trying to operate on any of it. Yet he's surviving. I'm thankful I got to spend all of the time I did and I'm thankful he got to adjust and accept life with cancer. But this shit is depressing. 5 years of constantly wondering if today is the day they go into the hospital for the final time, with only a couple days left to live. 5 years of spending every free moment with them, worried it's the last time you'll see them. That awkward and guilty feeling of taking a day off from work for just yourself, and not going to see them. That other awkward and guilty feeling of not seeing them for a few months because you are busy with life and have stuff to do, all the while knowing you aren't seeing them when they could be dead tomorrow. You want to move on but can't. \n\nIt's a state of permeant limbo. The pain is less than death, but it never stops. It's a slow torture. When that person dies and you can finally grieve for real, it's not long before you remember that another family member is still battling cancer.\n\nFuck cancer."}, {"comment_id": "dxmcgp7", "post_id": "8ddbjo", "comment": "Man this sucks.

We released a CGI trailer, gave some interviews and... went dark. Normal procedure for these kinds of things - you announce a game and then shut up, roll up your sleeves, and go to work. We wanted to give you The Witcher 3 and both expansions first, which is why this period of staying silent was longer than we planned. Sorry for that.\n\nAs soon as we concluded work on Blood and Wine we were able to go full speed ahead with CP2077's pre-production. But we chose to remain silent. Why? At some point, we made a decision to resume talking about the game only when we have something to show. Something meaningful and substantial. This is because we do realise you've been (im)patiently waiting for a very long time, and we wouldn't want anyone to feel that we're taking this for granted. On the contrary - it gives us a lot of extra motivation. The hype is real, so the sweat and tears need to be real, too :).\n\nBut to the point. Today is the day. If you're seeing this, it means you saw the trailer - our vision of Cyberpunk, an alternative version of the future where America is in pieces, megacorporations control all aspects of civilised life, and gangs rule the rest. And, while this world is full of adrenaline, don't let the car chases and guns mislead you. Cyberpunk 2077 is a true single player, story-driven RPG. You'll be able to create your own character and..., well, you'll get to know the rest from what we show at our booth at E3. Be on the lookout for previews!\n\nBefore we finish, you probably have some questions, right?\n\nWhen? When we told you we would only release the game when it's ready, we meant it. We're definitely much, much closer to a release date than we were back then :), but it's still not the time to confirm anything, so patience is still required. Quality is the only thing that drives us - it's the beauty of being an independent studio and your own publisher.\n\nHow big? Seriously big, but..., to be honest, we have no bloody clue at this point in time. Once we put it all together, we will openly tell you what you can expect. And we promise we'll do this before we start talking about any pre-orders or ask anything of you.\n\nFree DLC/Expansions/DRM? Expect nothing less than you got with The Witcher 3. As for DRM, CP2077 will be 100% DRM-free on PC.\n\nMicrotransactions? In a single player role-playing game? Are you nuts?\n\nOnce again, thank you for your patience. If you have a minute, do visit cyberpunk.net and share your opinion (about anything) with us. We read everything you post and we treat it very seriously.\n\nYours, CD PROJEKT RED Team"}, {"comment_id": "e0gcway", "post_id": "8q446n", "comment": "Also says you can create your character.
