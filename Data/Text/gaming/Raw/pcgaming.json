Someone told him about the Storm javelin ult glitch. He thought it was hilarious and went around killing Titans (extremely tanky enemy, even by looter shooter standards) for a bit just for the laughs and didn't gain any significant loot or anything since titans don't often drop anything.\n\nThen he posted a video about it for the same reason like this and the ones you mentioned, get exposure to it and the devs eyes on it.\n\nHowever, the most important detail is that the devs not only already knew about it, but also had a fix planned in the next patch coming in the next few days. This was also during the \"play early\" period before the official full release and that patch was the \"day 1\" patch. He got banned for \"exploiting resource economy\" or something to that effect even though he only messed around with it for a very shot amount of time then continuing to play the game normally. Keep in mind this is a PVE only game, there is no economy because there is no trading or pvp so this doesn't even impact other players let alone negatively affect their experience.\n\nIMO there are glitches that are clear exploits that have a massive negative impact on players experiences, then there are ones like this that are just fun and opportunistic for a period of time. Ones like this don't deserve being punished especially taking the entire context of the situation. \n\nTo Bioware's credit, they did rescind the ban after he contacted them and explained what was going on.  The damage was done though, he likely won't return to the game and they lose out a lot of content creator presence in the game and \"free advertisement\" that helps keep a playerbase and bring new people to the game. They basically killed their game overnight with this blunder. I can only imagine how many people got banned that aren't content creators or influencers that maybe werent' as lucky or got unbanned.

He wasn't worried about losing connections to his old friends, because Robert would play games with them every thursday night. Robert arrived at his new house and called the only ISP that services his house, \"BIG ISP Co.\" They sent a technician the next day to set up his Internet service.\n\n\"Okay, I've got your modem plugged in, now I just need to know what services you use.\" The tech looked down at his tablet and cleared his throat, preparing to read from a list. \"Just stop me when you hear a service you would like to use.\" He began to read, \"BIG Movies, BIG Music, BIG Storage.\" \n\n\"No, I don't use those, I didn't have BIG Internet at my last house.\" Robert replied, \"I think it would be faster if I just gave you a list of what I plan to use.\"\n\n\"That might be a problem, especially if your services don't fit in a BIG Internet bundle we already offer.\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\" \n\n\"Well, do you watch movies online from services like Netflix and Amazon Prime?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I do.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll add the streaming movies package.\" The tech checked off a box, and the monthly price for Robert's quote got higher at the bottom of the his tablet. \"What about television, do you catch up on missed episodes online? \n\n\"Yes, of course! I can't be around all the time when shows are on!\"\n\n\"No problem. I'll add the streaming television package too.\" The tech checked another box, and Robert's quote got higher again. \"How about music, you said you don't use BIG Music, do you want to listen to another internet radio service?\"\n\n\"I have a ton of Spotify playlists! Pretty much one for every occasion.\" \n\n\"Okay, we'll need to add the Music Streaming package, then.\" Another box checked, another increase to Robert's monthly subscription cost. \"Now, how about games, do you use BIG Games to play with friends?\"\n\n\"No, I connect with friends using Discord, and we play all sort of games.\" \n\n\"Discord, huh? VOIP service too, then.\" The tech scrolled through his list looking for VOIP services. He checked the box, and the quote got higher. \"You play games from Steam?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Origin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"GoG?\" \n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWith each \"yes,\" the price of Robert's monthly fee went up.\n\n\"Guild Wars?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Battle.net?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Star Citizen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Candy Crush?\"\n\n\"No. I don't play Candy Crush.\"\n\n\"Great, you're going to love the savings of not paying for Facebook games.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that.\" Robert looked at the tablet.

I learned to live without.  I am better off for it, as well.

He's, what, a level 70 elf?  \n\nSeriously, folks.  Forget the games.  They're a waste of life.  Put those hours into *yourself.*  Games aren't worth it.  And fuck the ISPs if they want to charge more.  Don't give them the money.  Put it into yourself.  Don't throw away your money and your life on a game.

They may or may not receive a higher grade, but will definitely have a stronger understanding of the material.\n\nThey can cheat. Sneaking a phone into a test or finding homework answers online is trivial. Requires very little time and effort. Guarantees a high grade.\n\nNow, for a student who is under immense pressure from parents, school staff, peers and society as a whole to get the best grades, what is the best option?\n\nCheating wins out almost every time.\n\nA parent beating their child for their C in algebra doesn't care that the child actually has a fairly firm grasp of the material and studies regularly, they care that the test grades are low. If the student cheats on tests, earns a high grade and learns nothing, they are praised.\n\nMost of the time, this pressure over high grades comes with the logic that you need good grades to get into a good college. Cheating is perfect for this. Most colleges only look at your SAT and GPA, which are easy to raise, and may or may not ask for more info such as essays or interviews. Furthermore, the simple fact that a student who cheats and learns nothing suffers no practical downside.

I think it's more than that.  Competition is fine (it happens everywhere).  Point is, compete fair and learn sportmanship.  I don't think Chinese culture teaches this as part of their core values.  I read Chinese history and the theme I saw is: \"Winners write history, and the survivors propagate the winner's story so they can scrape breadcrumbs from the winner's table\".\n\nExcess production capacity is a good point.  But this is part of the consequence of the political model China uses.  When you have one entity involves and decides on everything, the policy making lacks flexibility.  So there will be people who \"pushes the limit\" to obtain more resources from said entity, thus decreasing economical efficiency.  I believe what we are witnessing is China exporting these inefficiencies to the rest of the world, much like how the developed nations export their garbage to China.\n\nAs to your second point.  Well because of China's agricultural roots, frugality has always been a national character of Chinese.  So to many Chinese, intellectual property is a relatively new concept.  If you can share (with little effort), why not?  And since we already \"shared\" it, why not replicate it, so more people can benefit?\n\nIn summary, I think what OP said are the consequences of Chinese culture and the political model they use.  No easy solution though, maybe all online games should just run Chinese servers."}, {"comment_id": "emkqlpl", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "/u/DapperPenguinStudios has denied that this actually happened.

Please, with a grain of salt, understand I\u2019m in no way in favor of exclusivity. I think it sucks for the consumer in such a big way the reaction we are giving to Epic Games is definitely justified. Look at what\u2019s happened to the streaming services, fragmenting Netflix and Hulu and HBO and Disney and all twenty other services through content exclusivity and it\u2019s killing the industry. Instead of focusing on and developing the features that consumers want, their budgets go to securing exclusivity.\n\nWith that said, I\u2019ve absolutely loved Satisfactory, and have been following the dev team\u2019s statements and plans with earnest. What it boils down to, from their perspective, is that without the deal with Epic they would have to rush the game out, not knowing if sales would drive the insanely expensive development process with enough momentum to get the game to a point they\u2019re happy with. Epic essentially guarantees the devs a certain number of sales, so if the game doesn\u2019t sell like they hope it does the developers still get a check, and if they meet the mark, they get the check they would\u2019ve gotten without the deal. It\u2019s a win-win for them, they\u2019re basically getting free money if their game isn\u2019t received well in the beginning, plus getting feedback from players during a fully funded development period. From their perspective, what\u2019s the downside to accepting such a deal? PR, and PR alone.\n\nHere\u2019s what I think, being an uninformed idiot on the internet (and I mean that honestly). The fact that this offer is such a big deal to the devs says less about their integrity and more about the climate in the gaming industry. There was a front page meme about how none of us are willing to support developers and their working conditions. As much as I hate content exclusivity, I do love seeing developers get to do their jobs without worrying about the money, just about making good games. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a simple black and white scenario here.\n\nTL/DR: Exclusivity sucks big dick by constraining consumers choice, but it helps developers make the games they want to make instead of grabbing for cash, which means better games for consumers.\n\nAlso TL/DR: I really love Satisfactory and I understand why they did what they did. Wait until their contract with Epic runs out and they have already confirmed they\u2019re coming to Steam eventually, and hopefully the game will be done by then. Give it a shot when you\u2019ve got the choice you\u2019re looking for. :)"}, {"comment_id": "emibbjh", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "I'm in the same boat, I don't care if Satisfactory is 10 times better than Factorio, nothing can convince me to use Epic."}, {"comment_id": "emhse0c", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "Might go buy factorio to support the devs. Dont know anything about it."}, {"comment_id": "emhvb7y", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "It's really fun, the r/factorio subreddit has some of the nicest people you'll ever meet"}, {"comment_id": "emht6lm", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "i\u2019ve always wanted to play it but not really have the time to. i\u2019m buying it now just because of this"}, {"comment_id": "emi6rnq", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "Play the demo.

They don't give a fuck what their audience wants so long as they get extra money.\n\nWho the fuck wants to support business decisions like that?\n\nThere is literally no reason for things not be released on both platforms at damn near the same time except 'epic gave us a big bag of money' and I'm sorry, but unless you're a brand new dev team and seeking funds to *develop and create your game*, 'epic gave us a big bag of money' is not an acceptable reason to piss off large sections of your audience by arbitrarily withholding your product from specific retailers.\n\nFuck, if epic had a larger market share they'd be getting hit with anti-trust laws.\n\nIn short: FUCK EPIC. And fuck the developers and publishers who sell out to their shitty, anti-consumer business practices."}, {"comment_id": "emi4pv5", "post_id": "bkm55m", "comment": "Factorios a great game but the devs are even better.

I've NEVER used a default or community scheme I've liked, I always scrap it and make one from scratch.   \n\n\nmaking control schemes is NOT why the steam controller did poorly, let me break it down for you.   \n\n\nValve showed off the steam controller to a very minor extend before its release. Every one was skeptical about its \"emulated\" joy sticks and touch pads in place of said joy sticks. Valve didnt really do anything to ensure people \"yes this will be good, we've been testing the shit out of it and its good!\"   \n\n\nWhat did they do, like always they kept their damn mouths shut and let every one else do the talking for them, surprise, huge mistake.   \n\n\nThe moments these babies where dropped off the UPS trucks they flew in on, the reviewers ATE THAT SHIT UP. They all wanted to know what this new weird controller from the makers of Half Life and Team Fortress was all about and if the change was good or bad or what have you. They all spent like 2 or 3 hours with the thing, tossed it aside and said \"this sucks dick, dont buy it, is good for clicking on shit tho\"   \n\n\nSOOO many problems with this controllers release and all of it can be contributed to Valve not saying a god damn thing and doing zero PR work.   \n\n\n1) You're NOT going to get the hang of this controller in 2 hours, I had to use it for a straight week before It really started to click, I compare it to riding a bike for the first time. After years of muscle memory and comfort gaming with a dual stick controller, this thing will feel awkward as fuck at first and even harder to learn the gyro with the touch pad at the same time. When you do learn how to use it, its a game changer.   \n\n\n2) The fuck'n Gyro was NEVER advertised on this thing. I had been following this controller since they announced it. I was guilty of trying the controller for a few hours and thinking it was kind of a dud, but me along with thousands of other users didnt realize it had motion controls  in it (actually good controls too) and that they take this controller for pc gaming from a meger 4/10 exprience to a fuck'n 10/10 easy (for me anyway). Youtube videos started surfacing about the gyro built into it which helped a lot of people give it another try (my self included) and really get the ball going on this. Valve didnt bother to tell people until this video started getting popular and they put the damn video right up on steam so people could see it, they couldnt even be bothered to make their own fuck'n video.   \n\n\n3) harkening back to the video thing.. Valve NEEDED to demo this fuck'n thing to people and tell them/show them how to use it before sending it out into the wild. I compare this to all the goofy new \"extreme\" sports junk that comes out. When Razer scooters where new, they had those commercial showing off kids do'n sick ass tricks on them. Razer was smart said \"if we want our product to look cool and fun, we gotta show it off being used to its full potential and show kids how cool these things really are and what they can do!\". They got some dumb ass kids, taught them how to use them, turned them into experienced scooter riders (scooterers?), and showed it to the world. Valve didnt do anyt of this shit, valve did this: \"Here is a new scooter, it is metal, it has small wheels, it go fast. enjoy\" and then walked away.   \n\n\n  \n\n\nthe configs have NOTHING to do with why this controller failed. Doesn't help that it was also trying to gain traction in the wake of the Steam Machines which managed to be an even bigger failure so what little success it did have was overshadowed by the Steam Machines massive fuck up because yet again valve didnt want to actually do anything with that, they just wanted to make a gaming OS and drop it into the community like it was going to catch fire or something. Im a Valve fan and all (or used to be more of one anyway) but sometimes they really do some really dumb shit and squander some really good idea on being lazy as fuck."}, {"comment_id": "evo3xy3", "post_id": "cka890", "comment": "I own one and had no idea about the gyro until reading this thread.

In MY experience, I would use K+M for FPS games (you really can't compete online using a controller on PC), and action games play better with a traditional controller since those games were designed with those controllers in mind.

Not many want to take the time to learn a new set of skills, most are completely content with using their xbox controllers (or ds4/switch pro) for console ports and similar games made for controllers, and their kbm's for everything else. And main stream reviewers/big name youtubers simply dont have the time to devote to it even if they wanted to learn, considering their job requirements basically mean shoveling out as much content as possible as fast as possible.\n\nWhich is fine. Nothing inherently wrong with that. But it is why so many keep saying the touch pads suck even though they are pretty ace once you've gotten used to them, and definitely contributes to the low adoption rate of the Steam Controller. There are people in this very thread saying that they didnt buy it simply because its not a dual stick controller... so that alone means there is more to it than software.\n\nThat isnt the SC's or Valve's fault though. I think of it more as the SC being ahead of its time, as I hope that one day we'll return to the age where every console generation all manufacturers - not just Nintendo - were pushing the boundaries of input design trying to find something better.

But any of their chests show you exactly whats in them, they dont contain dumb shit like voice lines or sprays, and you're guaranteed to not get any duplicates unless you purchase the crate more times than there are skins in which to obtain (excluding the extremely rare items which are usually only one or two per chest depending on how many items are in it to start)\n\nthese days if there is an item or cosmetic I want in dota, I can buy it on the market from another user, generally for pretty cheap (unless its rare), but a rare item is often cheaper to just buy flat out from another user than it is to try and gamble on the specific \"crate/chest\" over and over again until I get lucky.\n\nbut when I got into dota, i was able to put like $5 into my steam wallet and buy a shit load of dumb little items for 6 cents here, 40 cents there, a dollar over that way.

I'm somewhat sympathetic to the exhausting nature of dealing with the player base myself, especially when most of the decisions which upset them are coming down from above and you can't change them, and a tonne of the criticism is outright personally hateful and toxic.\n\n**But that still doesn't excuse not doing the right thing for your playerbase as a whole.**\n\nYou don't rip them off, and accuse them of being entitled and moochers just because you're tired of being a firewall for EA. You don't encourage exploitative practices just because it earns a shit tonne of money for EA.\n\nYou are not a slave. You are not a drone. You still should do what is moral and right because, if you *truly* love gaming you do what is best for *gamers*, irrespective of what Corporate demands you do.\n\nIn my own case, I walked from EA / Broadsword when I spent 10 hours of my free time building a replacement event because the staff had refused to do the set up, then bollocked me for using a piece of land that *nowhere* in the handbook did it say you could not. That I was given a warning for actually trying to give my players the events they deserved.\n\nFuck that. Fuck anything or any one who says you should do what you know to be wrong.\n\nAnd you especially don't lash out at the entire gaming community because of any cognitive dissonance on *your* part about the moral compromises or betrayals you might have engaged in; it's not *their* fault the industry treats them like cattle to be milked and consumed. \n\nAnd you don't judge them all by the most sociopathic and broken individuals within the community either. You don't have to let lunatics drag you down into their own lunacy.\n\nAgain, I understand it can be exhausting; *but you don't become a mirror of that toxicity yourself too.*\n\nAnd for what? [To try and exploit over $200 *in a single season* out of people who the industry has known for more than half a decade or more are likely to be lonely and vulnerable?](https://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/195806/chasing_the_whale_examining_the_.php)\n\nSo to the developers of Apex Legends I say this; instead of raging and lashing out at people who rightly are angry about your funding model... how about simply refusing to be part of it? You're not walking away from your \"dream job\" if you do, because I rather doubt when you were young and innocent your dream job involved gouging your fellow players for every dollar you could get.\n\nAnd if it *was* your dream to make a tonne of money and fuck the playerbase... you don't get to be angry when they call you out on it either.
