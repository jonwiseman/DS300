It gives the feeling that the riders are just cool with him doing his thing on the piano. It's a casual scene with an oddity that interacts so well that it doesn't effect the peaceful feeling of the rest of the scene if it was missing. In doing so, you've made something typically abstract/strange feel normal. \n\nYou did a great job capturing how the pianist was feeling out his music...

One spammer or botter can ruin conversation in an entire community. They're persistent and their work - ruining - is easier than building. Like with last year's April Fools, Robin, how it only took 1 person spamming nonsense to seriously disrupt a chat of 16 or 32 people. So you get this idea that a good portion of people are terrible, because a good deal of what you see is terribleness. \n\nBut when you limit everyone to each having the same impact, so one ruiner can only post one pixel at a time - or two or three, if they have some alts - and each creator can place the same number of pixels, the sheer overwhelming number of good people becomes apparent. Someone puts down a pixel to mess something up, someone else puts down a pixel to fix it, and a second person puts down a pixel to build it further. Progress is made. The void was beaten back every time, and I'm sure it would have been again if the experiment had gone on a few hours longer. \n\nPeople had a huge canvas that they could do anything with, and they chose to fill it with really cool things and expressions of teamwork and love.

Others might take closer to 15-20. Time commitment to get to the level where you can actually make something like this is at least a couple thousand hours of practice.\n\nIn terms of how much easier or more difficult it is compared to other mediums also depends. You will be fastest with whatever medium you're most comfortable in and you find any medium that you're uncomfortable in to be difficult. Assuming an even playing field (i.e. you're equally comfortable in both digital and tradtional mediums like oils or acrylics). Digital will almost certainly be *faster*. Not because anything is necessarily being done *for* you. But things like color selection and mistake correction are made more efficient than in dealing with physical pigmented paints. Instead of mixing a color..you can simply pick it (the knowledge of which color to pick still has to be there...it's just that digital speeds up the process of *getting to* that color).\n\nTools required: A Wacom tablet or other pressure sensitive tablet (hooks up to PC via usb). A PC. A digital painting program (ranging from professional options like Photoshop or Corel Painter to free alternatives like Krita).\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "due6sj0", "post_id": "7y6m7a", "comment": "[This guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ykOK_obacVQ) (Warning: spook alert) does a very cool timelapse of one of his digital pieces.
