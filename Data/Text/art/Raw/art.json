I was mostly impressed because each pixel was worth 5 minutes of waiting to place the next one. So that means for just a 8x8 pixel object it would take over 5 hours for one person to complete assuming no one messed it up in the 5 hours. Even if 5 people pooled into the 8x8 image it would still take over an hour of dedication for the tiny image. I understand thousands of people contributed to one image but most of those are way over 8x8 pixels with each 2x2 area increasing the work load my 20 minutes for one user.\n\nThis type of behavior is seen in ffa mine craft servers all the time but they can place hundreds of blocks an hour. In just 3 days the amount of complexity and preservation is unmatchable anywhere else on reddit. This eclipses the button's level of clan forming and territory.

Maybe that's dropping out and it leads directly to the top.

Symbols have a long history, and Hitler appropriated a very positive symbol to use on the flag for his horrible campaign. In the western world, he effectively corrupted and ruined the symbol's original message of peace and good luck (I'm simplifying things somewhat, but essentially it was a symbol with very positive connotations). Many parts of Asia were never directly affected by the Nazis, and therefore the symbol's reputation was never ruined there. In fact, during World War I many European soldiers actually carried little metal versions of this symbol as good luck charms. It appeared on greeting cards, and was very popular for a time. \n\nAnd this is why it's so upsetting that people are assuming that this guy is painting Nazi propaganda onto a bowl. Because it shows that even though Hitler didn't win the war, he still won the symbol (in Europe at least). And that's unfair, because the original symbol has really positive meanings and doesn't deserve the terrible reputation it has gotten. By associating it with Hitler, we're just doing what he wanted us to do. It's about time we stopped thinking of it in a negative light and returned to the symbol in its original context.

The little dragon drew in a deep breath before he blew a small, blue, flame across the top, caramelizing the dessert. \n\nAmanda held her breath, her eyes wide, until the little dragon finished as sat back, giving a small cough; a little puff of smoke drifted from its mouth. The waiter stroked its back again. \n\n\"Enjoy,\" he said and slipped away back into the restaurant. \n\nAmanda picked up her spoon and gently scooped into the dessert, breaking the top of it. She brought it up to her mouth and took the bite, almost melting in her seat. It was delicious; smooth and sweet.

A beautiful and frustrating thing to have a memory that you think about frequently, but can't recall completely. Today we just see our pictures on social media or Google two words of what we're thinking about and it's there. The feelings, at least for me, aren't as strong.

I realized only recently how binary my perspective was- \u201cI am a depressed person surviving the days\u201d or \u201cI am doing great and totally beat depression\u201d.

You\u2019ve been eating okay recently, a few cereal dinners wouldn\u2019t hurt...* and then it was like I woke up. I realized what a son of a bitch that depression was and that it NEVER GOES AWAY AND THATS OKAY. Hear me out: it is not a failure when you enter depressed person stage. It\u2019s like waves- high tides, low tides, and days where you\u2019re nowhere near the water. But you\u2019re still you and depression doesn\u2019t define you when it is or isn\u2019t around. Sorry for the rant, but I found it revitalizing that i don\u2019t have to feel like a complete failure every time it creeps back up. It\u2019s a thing, I\u2019m working on it.

Thank you all so much for the kind words, I did not expect this! I will try get to answering questions soon, and I will try to answer a few of the more common ones here.\n\nThis is about 1/4 of the book, and was done around 2013. The whole book took around 1.5 years to finish? Which I may post it\u2019s entirety some time!\n\nAnswers to some questions I\u2019ve seen:\n\nDo I use Fixative?\n\nYes! But only after a single page is completely done, i don\u2019t like the way workable fixative changes the texture of the paper if you are still working on it. It tends to make the paper not as toothy so getting a solid dark is hard. That\u2019s why there is a smudge on the opposite pages but the actual drawing isn\u2019t too blurry. I place a piece of paper under my hand so I don\u2019t smudge what I\u2019m working on.\n\nWhat pencils do you use and what book is that?\n\nAny Mechanical pencil for everything. 2h or hb to rough in the composition in scribbles, then erase bits I don\u2019t like. Then I use a hb and 2b to do everything else. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t smudge much too, not using super soft pencils. Book is moleskine sketchbook!\n\nHow long does each one take?\n\nI can\u2019t give a solid answer because most of them were done while on public transport, in cafes and such or watching tv. At a guess the single page ones are about 7-8 hours and the double page ones around 20-30 hours.\n\nDo you draw these somewhere else first then transfer it into this book?\n\nNope, draw straight into this book. I first use a light pencil like a 2h or hb and sketch in all the rough shapes first. Then I work from left to right and fill in all the detail methodically so I don\u2019t smudge the paper. Something about my brain won\u2019t let me not finish something. That\u2019s why everything is so detailed.\n\nWhy are you like this?\n\nI was no good! I am not gifted. I started drawing as a kid and never stopped. But it\u2019s not too late for you! When I decided to take this seriously as a career choice in 2012, I spent Thousands of hours in practice. I used to wake up 2 hours earlier than I needed to before work and sit in a cafe every morning to draw before I had to go inside the hell of daily grind. Then I would draw on public transport to and from and then when I got home for another few hours. So that\u2019s about 5 hours of drawing a day plus a 9-5 job doing graphic design. I trained my brain to feel guilty when I wasn\u2019t practicing. Social media is a great way to hold yourself accountable to keep going.\n\nHow can I get better?\n\nPractice lots!!! Read above. Practical tips: go to life drawing classes. Set up still life\u2019s. Get out books and watch tutorials on YouTube. Study the work of artists\nYou like! Books I can recommend: any book by Andrew loomis. And color and light by James gurney (illustrator of dinotopia). \n\nDo you tattoo or thought about doing it?\n\nNo I do not tattoo, yes I have thought about it. I applied for quite a few apprenticeships and kept getting turned down because \u201c you have too much experience and your own thing going on\u201d which I don\u2019t really understand what that means. I have a few tattooist friends and they say they don\u2019t have time to do their own art anymore which kind of put me off for now. I would like to give it a go some time anyway! \n\nWhat do you do now?\n\nI moved from pencil drawing to color pencils and now I am predominantly painting with acrylics and oils. I occasionally do murals too. It won\u2019t let me post social media links on here but search my reddit username on other platforms ;)\n\nI have had 3 solo exhibitions now, in 2013, 2016, and 2017. And a few group exhibitions along the way too.\n\nI went from working a 9-5 graphic design job to support myself making art, now I am working a casual job and doing more art and soon I will transition to doing art full time hopefully. Don\u2019t quit your day job to become an artist straight away!\n\n\nThat\u2019s all I can think of now! I will add to this later. Thank you so much again!\n\nPs, lots of comments about sending nudes, I will accept nudes lol, no dicks tho please.\n\nPps. I have no idea what net neutrality is.\n\n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dq6xndd", "post_id": "7er18u", "comment": "Some drawings remind me of the early Berserk comics.\nVery impressive!"}, {"comment_id": "dq6ymai", "post_id": "7er18u", "comment": "I love this kind of drawing.

It obviously shows a lot of skill, but do you have anything to say with it?\n\nAs I write this out, it sounds dumb or maybe insulting to ask. But you said elsewhere it took you 10-15 hours to do this. Presumably you could do an oil painting or watercolor in half that time, and still have an artwork that feels warm and vibrant, but not nearly as realistic. Does the hyper realism add some meaning for you, or is it just for its own sake?\n\nI do enjoy the drawing a lot. I\u2019m just curious about the thought process behind it.

You got the lighting on the oranges down pat. I would suggest using the same heaviness of colored pencils consistently throughout the piece so the eye isnt drawn to places it shouldn't, so to speak. You cant see the paper/canvas (whatever you're drawing on) in the front n center orange, but to the right of it you can, which pulls your eye away from the great detail you put into the oranges themselves. You dont want to see the tooth of the paper in some spots and in others not, its distracting and inconsistent.\n\nThis is a really nice piece and I imagine it's only a glimpse of what you can do.

It was a comissioned piece by a private collector who owned and crashed the original Benz this is a replica of. It currently is in a private collection, for the most part inaccessible to the public, but was on display for a bit this past October in Philadelphia.\n\nWhen I was working on the prototype of this piece, we were experimenting in making the car with glass, using an ultra-clear UV glue. Together he and I designed and built various jigs to adhere the triangular plates at the necessary, ultra-specific angles needed.\n\nI stopped working for him before this project ever switched to steel, so I am unfamiliar with a lot of the finer details of how the finished piece came together. I know that the pieces ended up all being laser-cut, but do not know if he welded the whole thing together or used some sort of adhesive.

Van Gogh lived well in the hospital; he was allowed more freedoms than any of the other patients. If attended, he could leave the hospital grounds; he was allowed to paint, read, and withdraw into his own room. He was even given a studio. While he suffered from the occasional relapse into paranoia and fits - officially he had been diagnosed with epileptic fits - it seemed his mental health was recovering.\n\nUnfortunately, he relapsed. He began to suffer hallucination and have thoughts of suicide as he plunged into depression. Accordingly, there was a tonal shift in his work. He returned to incorporating the darker colors from the beginning of his career and Starry Night is a wonderful example of that shift. Blue dominates the painting, blending hills into the sky. The little village lays at the base in the painting in browns, greys, and blues. Even though each building is clearly outlined in black, the yellow and white of the stars and the moon stand out against the sky, drawing the eyes to the sky. They are the big attention grabber of the painting\n\nhttp://www.vangoghgallery.com/painting/starry-night.html"}, {"comment_id": "dmvs7df", "post_id": "6zhxj9", "comment": "I just saw the Dr. Who Van Gogh episode.

But it makes me wonder.\n\nAll those images, movies, games and literature where this type of space-vessels are portrayed... How realistic are they actually, in terms of manufacturing them? We're talking thousands of square meters worth of thick metal plates being not only cut to shape and size, but also bent, curved and finally, welded or riveted. Well, it has to be welded in order to form a good seal but still.\n\nI don't think it's even remotely possible to have a huge enough manufacturing plant to produce most of those panels that we can see here. And think about the actual assembly time of the whole vessel. Even if we use man made AI robots and welders, it would take YEARS for such a huge thing to be made.\n\nTo add onto that, a simple quarter panel of a car or a fender might require a stamping machine 20-30 times bigger in size than the actual part it makes, let alone the weight of the machine itself and the cost of the tools and dies. Additionally, we're talking about a ginormous amount of raw material, mainly iron, which needs to be made into hardened steel. Again, a massive amount of material and pre-production processes and costs.\n\nI mean, I'm an automotive engineer, and I know a thing or two about manufacturing vehicles, but it always boggles my mind how our real life space-venturing crafts will end up looking. It's both an exciting thought, but also a very hard one to think about, given the sheer scale of things.\n\nAnyway, there's my random daily ramble.

I\u2019ve never shared this thought process before, so I do hope I manage to convey it satisfactorily.\n\n\nI grew up watching Robin Williams. He was, is, and always will be, my favourite actor. I have sought out and watched almost every film, TV show, and stand-up special he made (although there are a few I haven\u2019t managed to get hold of). I even managed to see him perform live while I was living in Sydney, something I never expected to get to experience while I was growing up.\n\nThere was something amazing about Robin, and every performance he gave. I never identified what it was that drew me to his work - I don\u2019t think I ever wanted to, for fear understanding how it worked would ruin the magic.\n\nI don\u2019t work in the film industry, but I\u2019ve always dabbled in screenwriting. It\u2019s always there, as a distant someday-maybe-one-of-my-movies-will-get-made kind of goal. A hobby. And, inevitably, characters would show up in what I was writing that would become Robin. It was never intended, but would emerge despite my intentions for the story. The more I wrote, the more that back-of-my-mind goal started to include not just making a film, but making one with Robin. It never really felt like a pipe dream, despite how glaringly obvious that title should have been.\n\nWhen I heard the news of his passing, I couldn\u2019t believe it. I was in shock. The world was instantly a darker place. A sadder place. I struggled to watch his movies.\n\nAs time passed, I came to realise that the world didn\u2019t get darker, or sadder - at least not in the long run. I was mourning the loss of what Robin may have created in the future. I was mourning the fact that the world wouldn\u2019t continue getting brighter, not that it had gotten darker.\n\nAnd seated underneath all of that, was the admission that I would never make a film with Robin Williams. A selfish reason to mourn? Certainly. But we can\u2019t always decide how we respond to things like this.\n\nThe more I thought about it, though, and the more I started to write again, a realisation grew. One that helped me finally watch his movies without sadness, without missing Robin. I realised that I might never make a film with Robin Williams, but I realised that I would also never make a movie without him, either.\n\nThe inspiration, the motivation, the genuine joy, that Robin Williams provided, is an integral part of anything I write. And should anything I write, one day, ever get made - then it obviously won\u2019t star Robin Williams, but it will owe its existence to him, in a very significant way.\n\nAnd for that, Robin Williams, I thank you."}, {"comment_id": "dtz820s", "post_id": "7wb2vg", "comment": "Nice drawing!

By first figuring out what path the pen must take to draw the picture, sampling the x and y coordinates along the path, you can do two ffts in MATLAB or whatever other signal processing/math software with those samples to generate the coefficients for the frequency components of each of the 1 dimensional waveforms.
