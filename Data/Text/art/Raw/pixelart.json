I\u2019ve tried doing similar things with pixel art in the past (mixing 3D or more realistic effects while still retaining the pixel art style), and I think you really pulled it off here. I especially like the addition of the line highlight around all the edges. Although I have to say that\u2019s where you\u2019ve puzzled me with the effect. It looks like you\u2019re using a displacement map to do the refraction (might be a normal map since you\u2019re also highlighting the sunlight reflecting off the surface), and then I assumed you\u2019d be using a heightmap and that\u2019s how you\u2019re understanding if any given pixel is submerged (that\u2019s approach I\u2019ve taken in the past). But the more I look at it, the more it looks like the water is actually staying level, it\u2019s just the line highlights which shift up and down creating the illusion that the water is going up and down. So that\u2019s where I\u2019m wondering if this is actually just creative use of how you\u2019re tiling the water/the transparent texture, and then it\u2019s just the the line highlight that\u2019s giving the illusion of added depth. Which if that\u2019s the case, that\u2019s actually pretty clever and a good way of avoiding having to add a lot of additional work to a 2D pipeline. \n\nAlso took a look at your progress and the game looks really good so far, I really like the over all style and charm of it."}, {"comment_id": "f1srj58", "post_id": "da3npf", "comment": "Very observant! First, I'm a 2d programmer who just started 3d 3 months ago so my methods are a little weird.\n\nNo normals, displacement, or height maps/Z-buffers were used.  A Z-buffer would be super helpful but because I'm pulling a lot of weird tricks to keep the 3d scene perfectly pixel aligned, the Z-buffer would have a lot of oddities. It may still be a better method but I didn't try it. \n\nIt would be pretty difficult to explain what I'm doing without pictures, but the depth is super hackish or \"creative\" like you suggested, and indeed, the water surface does not truly move.

The animation's improved, but the bounce is too much. Slow it down, and use some sub-pixel animation to get things looking smoother.
