If they have a disposition to be anxious, self-conscious, depressed, etc. in the first place, then it just exacerbates that. They go online and see thousands of artists working away and get a little disheartened, especially if the work is grand, or the artist is much younger. \n\nThere was  documentary on Napoli tailoring I watched called Omast (https://m2m.tv/watch/omast-the-art-of-neapolitan-tailoring/films) - one of the the tailors said, after telling a story on how as kids they would have to practice the same routine over and over again, 'Practice before passion'.

It was completely opposite of how he was raised and lived, so he just couldn't see it as a good idea. \n\nAbout a month after I bought the business, he came down and took a look at it. His health was garbage, but he made the trip to see my passion in play. \n\nAfter about 6 months, I got back my earnings report and called him to tell him that I was making far more with the new job than the old one. From then on, about one a month, he would apologize for his hesitancy with my chosen job.
