It was completely opposite of how he was raised and lived, so he just couldn't see it as a good idea. \n\nAbout a month after I bought the business, he came down and took a look at it. His health was garbage, but he made the trip to see my passion in play. \n\nAfter about 6 months, I got back my earnings report and called him to tell him that I was making far more with the new job than the old one. From then on, about one a month, he would apologize for his hesitancy with my chosen job.

Our dreams have substance, and we re-create our own reality and reason of being, by funneling that energy through our art. Whether we are visual artists or musicians, we need to do it! If we allow others to force us to fit their ideas of what they want us to be, we often end up bitter and at  odds with those who we once relied upon for sound advice, unhappy that we disappointed them by not fitting into the mold they made for us. I am 72, a professional violinist, and visual artist. But I have to admit, I had to work in a conventional \"job\" in communications to support my children as a single parent. I often wonder if I had pursued what I loved most in life, would I have postponed marriage and family until I had a successful career in my chosen field. As it is, I have had to put my music and art last, after my other responsibilities. And here I am at my age, striving to succeed at what makes me who I am. And I keep hoping I still have time to spend all the creativity which was stifled many years ago. Your art is GOOD. Find a mentor or two. Learn your craft, study different mediums.

I don't use the term lightly - I only get to see my SO of six years about once every year/every other year due to distance and complications. This reminds me of saying goodbye, that crushing feeling of knowing you will not be able to see your loved one for a very long time but remembering his embrace after he's gone. It's a loving embrace though. Thank you for sharing such an intimate part of yourself, I hope my relating this to my LDR is not offensive. It helped me heal in my own situation/perspective.

In the future,  try to decide if you would like more focus on the sky or foreground.  The horizon line in the middle of the canvass makes it hard for the viewer to find the focal point. The sky is really well done, but the foreground looks unfinished to me. I would work on the shape of the reflecting water and repeating more sky colors further down the painting.  It looks like you used a photo for reference, which is great, but it makes it harder to find those colors in the darks and lights, but they are there.  It also makes the darks, darker than they should be, and blows out the lights.  Remember that nothing in the sky should be darker than on the ground.  You really have talent and promise and I hope you continue the learning process that we all are always in! Side note... look up Richard Schmid.

I can't fully tell if it is the due to the completely different texture, and no other version of that texture exists in the composition, so it might be lacking a little unity.\n\nBut! If you treated these stripes with the exact same paint application as the rest of your piece, I fear it would loose 'something', (perhaps become too flat?) not sure what ,I can't put my finger on it! \n\nRegardless of that, I still feel this is a very successful painting, great job!"}, {"comment_id": "ewvrdns", "post_id": "cqayan", "comment": "So you think you\u2019re the rat king huh?

I've never done oils before (only some watercolor and 1 acrylic painting), the reason being because I'm a Geologist by profession.\n\nI can probably identify the rock if you had close up photos of the backside of the rock and where in the US you found it (there is a nice geologic map showing the bedrock composition of the US). Based on it's semi-rounded shape but large size I suspect it hasn't traveled to far from its source rock.\n\nBefore you painted on it, was the rock composed of a series of randomly sorted pink, white, and black crystals? If so then yes it is granite.\n\nAnd for all the folks giving you shade for taking a rock along a stream, they're just a-holes. Yeah there might have been some benthic macroinvertebrates that relied on that rock for shelter/shade/whatever else small creatures need rocks for...but judging by how the river system looks like in the background I'm pretty sure removing one rock won't harm the ecosystem. The earth has experienced worse. Plus, that rock was probably going to sit there for a couple of hundred years until a massive flood moves it downstream a foot or two, maybe get a bit more polished, pretty much be around far longer than our brains can fathom.
