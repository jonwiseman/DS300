To get it to burn bright enough, you have to get it to about 6 or 7 rotations per second. You're going to be covered in burning shrapnel, so both the technician and subject need to either be cool with the tops of their heads getting singed, or they need to be covered with something, ideally fire resistant.\n\nThe end result, if done right, will look an awful lot like the Dr. Strange portals.\n\nI wish I had pictures of this, but I was working with someone else to pull this off, and it was all shot on their camera.

The final project can be anything we want it to be, our goal is just to produce a coherent body of work that is not only technically correct but also impactful in some way. \n\nFor day to day stuff we'll have basic assignments in the beginner classes like \"come in with 10 photos with slow shutter speeds showing motion\" \"10 photos stopping motion\" \"one subject shot 10 separate times from different angles\" and such. \n\nAs the classes get more advanced we start doing more advanced dark room or digital techniques like pushing film, toning prints, making a composite image in the dark room from multiple images and enlargers or the same thing in photo shop. \n\nA lot of days are basic work days spent in the dark room or in the digital labs editing photos. For digital we're taught methods on how to color correct images and then how to print them so they are the same as the screen. We have full access to the teacher to ask any questions. \n\nA lot of what we learn is in those basic work days. Just being able to always ask a question whether it be about gear, techniques, technical editing questions etc. \n\nWe're also usually tasked with writing a paper or two about a photographer of our choosing. Sometimes they have to be from a certain era sometimes anything we like. Then we have to present to the class our work. So you end up learning about and being exposed to a lot of photographers. Many classes are also spent looking at photo books as a group and talking about other photographers work. Great way to get inspiration!\n\nOnce every three or four classes we have to have printed work for a group critique on our final project. Great for getting feedback and nailing down your idea. \n\nOur finals are usually our final project matted, and sometimes framed, and prepared as if we were showing them for a gallery. At the end of the year 1-4 of your works can be selected for the annual school gallery as well.

The dolly-zoom effect in the 2nd part is actually digital (the creator zoomed in at the same rate of the camera moving back).\n\nThere are actually many resources to research about this. It clears the misconception that focal length creates compression. Focal length does not, distance does. A longer focal length simply forces you to stand further - hence everything will look compressed due to paralax effect (maybe paralax I'm not too sure).\n\nAn understandable example would be this: hold an apple one meter from your camera at night, it will look 10 times as big as the moon. Now move the apple further away from the camera a few dozen steps, it will look exactly as big as the moon. The focal length never changed, but if you cropped in on the 2nd picture, the moon is as big as an apple.

The problem is if there's no content, your users leave. And the really dangerous fact that most mods seem to forget: Delete my post once, shame on you; delete my post twice, shame on me. Having a post deleted *stings* and may dissuade many people from ever trying again. \n\nHere's the model: You have signal (posts / good content) and you have noise (spam, abuse). Every post is some level of signal vs. noise. The goal is to maximize signal and minimize noise. The problem is that so many mods think a wise move is to remove posts that *they perceive* as being \"not enough signal.\" \n\nThe problem is that the signal / noise ratio is different for every person. And when you get \"a lot\" of users complaining about some kind of post, you really should consider the number of people complaining vs. the number of viewers you have. In other words - don't let the noisy minority drive your decisions (even if you agree with them). \n\nFor the most part, leave posts that are \"lower\" signal. Only remove posts that are virtually 100% noise. Let voting deal with the rest. "}, {"comment_id": "e43i6pd", "post_id": "96rwhs", "comment": "Why is ccurzio a mod?

If I were a (more) cynical person I'd say that this was an intentional effort to show us how quickly the sub goes to shit with unrestricted questions.  I've definitely seen an uptick in questions that really don't belong on the front page of the subreddit.\n\nDid anyone consider, yanno, an _intermediate step_?  I've felt like the \"submitting to r/photography\" notes has been too strongly worded for a while, especially with the \"When in doubt, post in the question thread only, without making a separate post.\"  I think a much more reasonable starting point would've been making the question megathread a gear question megathread.  Many shallow questions are gear related anyways.  Add \"basic technique\" to that and  you'd probably catch most of them.  Add a few examples of questions that belong and don't belong in the question megathread under the new policy and I think people would be less scared off.\n\nSide note: I keep on seeing people say that the vast vast majority of questions in the megathread get answered.  Yes, usually by three or four comments.  For some questions, that's appropriate.  What I think (what I hope?) most people who are complaining about things getting buried are actually complaining about are questions which could've prompted more substantial discussions getting the same 2-4 responses as \"should I upgrade from the 5d2 to the A7iii\".\n\n*Anyways*, **I don't consider \"too many questions put into the megathread\" to be the core of the problems with this sub**.  With 600k+ subscribers why couldn't we get more activity on the posts that remained?  I rarely saw much discussion on articles about the art side of photography when they get posted here.  The top post here is about Net Neutrality ffs.\n\nHere's an idea:\n\nPortfolio/image series critiques.\n\nFor the first full weekend of every month, you can post a (cohesive) set of 8-24 pictures.  Then people can give feedback, with an emphasis on the overall thematic content (and less \"you're backfocused here, you needed to stop down there, is your monitor calibrated?\").  I think this is closer to what people do in art schools.\n\nMaybe even have themed months: street, landscape, travel, whatever.  I don't have any firm belief that I picked the right time intervals/number of photos.\n\nBasically, I'm trying to find a niche not currently filled by r/pics, /r/itookapicture, or /r/photocritique, that's both unlikely to result in a ton of spam and also going to bring content to the sub that we don't currently have."}, {"comment_id": "e44f28f", "post_id": "96rwhs", "comment": ">  If I were a (more) cynical person I'd say that this was an intentional effort to show us how quickly the sub goes to shit with unrestricted questions.\n\nThat has indeed been done exactly for that reason before, and the sub did immediately (and predictably) turn into shit. The kind of shit it has turned into right now.\n\n> I think a much more reasonable starting point would've been making the question megathread a gear question megathread.\n\nExactly. I firmly believe (and hope it goes back to this, please god) that at the very least all the \"gear purchasing\" question are swiftly removed and asked to be moved to the questions thread. There's a million questions every day of the kind \"what's a good cheap camera for a beginner\" or variations of such.

Thanks.\"\n\nI think it comes down to being a (possibly inadvertent) power struggle between the dedicated regulars of the community who have /r/photography on their bookmark bar or whatever, and the more casual visitors and subscribers. The former group  wants to weed out the crap so they don't have to sift through it looking for high-quality discussions, and that's an understandable desire. But I think as communities grow they have to decide who they'll cater to. Reddit has limits and you can't please everyone. At the end of the day, it's just a discussion board. But one thing that's worked for the community I moderate (which is different in that it's a support community, but the same principle could apply,) is having a discord channel where the regulars hang out and talk about what they want, and the new tab is what it is. (Still subject to some moderate posting rules to keep things relatively substantive.)
