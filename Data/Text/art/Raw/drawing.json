As well as where to find me!\n\nARTISTS STATEMENT \n\u201cArt is something I always had an interest in, but the pursuit of which sometimes got lost for me in the race of life. Unfortunately I experienced a serious injury, which although traumatic, allowed me the chance to slow down and reassess my life. Creating art became a huge part of my recovery. Not only was it therapeutic physically, as it helped my regain strength and dexterity. But it also gave me a way to improve myself mentally, a way to see and appreciate what was around me, and a skill to harness and be proud of. Creation is an outlet to make sense of an otherwise senseless situation.\u201d\n\nBIO\nNathaniel is a 33 year old local artist, residing in Amesbury MA. He studied architecture at the Wentworth Institute of Technology, graduating in 2009. Upon graduation he went to work in his field, consulting for a local residential design firm. In early 2010 he relocated to St. Croix, in the US Virgin Islands to work in print & marketing as a graphic/web designer. He worked for close to a year until a serious car accident in December of 2010 left him paralyzed and without the use of his hands. He began drawing very simple pictures, with assistance, as therapy while in the hospital. After a few months, he moved back home and started in on a vigorous therapy schedule. As time passed by and he gained enough strength to draw on his own, his control and ability slowly increased. After concentrating mainly on black-and-white pen drawings for the first year or so, he started introducing color to his projects using Photoshop and eventually moved on to painting. Computer aided graphics have become a large part of his creative process. Most of his drawings and paintings are laid out and experimented with in Photoshop before putting pen or paint to paper and canvas. From his home studio, Nathaniel works mainly in pen and ink, watercolor, or oil paint. Spending much of his time experimenting with styles in his work, he also is commissioned often to create traditional portrait paintings of people and animals.\n\nFIND ME\nIG: @natebibaud\nFB: Nathaniel Bibaud Art & Design\nSTORE: flatearthdesigns.etsy.com\nWEB: nathanielbibaud.com"}, {"comment_id": "dwppyp5", "post_id": "897dg6", "comment": "Your work is really beautiful.
