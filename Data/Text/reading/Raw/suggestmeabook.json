If you like it, you can read the rest. :) I've re-read Sabriel a lot at different points in my life, and it holds up even as an adult. \n\n**Most anything by Dianna Wynn Jones** \\- I loved (LOVED LOVED) the **Chrestomanci series** in particular, but **Howl's Moving Castle** was also great, and I loved the **Dalemark Quartet** books. I haven't re-read these so I don't know how they hold up, but she's really great at having books in a series that seem unrelated to each other or only loosely related and then - BAM, they all tie into something bigger. So good. \n\n**The Blue Sword** is also an old favorite of mine, written by Robin McKinley. I don't really like her newer works as much, but she did a lot of fantasy/re-told fairy tales, and they were enjoyable/satisfying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Still part of the former category but with some reservations:**\n\nLeigh Bardugo's **Grisha trilogy** is ok - I had mixed feelings about it, but think it might have been because I was a touch out of the age range for it when I read it. BUT - **her duology set in the same universe after is AMAZING** and almost feels like a different writer somehow (**Six of Crows**, and the sequel, **Crooked Kingdom**). Having read the initial trilogy gave me more background for terms and concepts, and it allowed me to enjoy the easter eggs and call backs as well. I think you could probably just read Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom if you only wanted to read one of the sets. :) Satisfying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Not exactly like Harry Potter but still very good fantasy:**\n\n**Blood Song** by Anthony Ryan is the beginning of a fantasy series that I haven't finished, but it was fun on its own (the sequel was enjoyable too, but I don't remember much from it). Not one that I've reread, but I enjoyed the experience of reading it the first time. Surprisingly quick read - could have used some editing (I think it was initially self published), but still pretty good. Read like a mix of YA and Adult fantasy.\n\nI also really loved the **Lord of the Rings**, as well as **the Hobbit**, but they have a different \"feel\" from Harry Potter imo. They have magic, and an epic battle between good and evil, and an incredibly rich world to step into so I do recommend them in general - just not as a direct comparison to HP. I remember I really loved The Hobbit right away, but it took me a little bit to warm up to Lord of the Rings as a kid. As an adult though, it is in my top five favorite series. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally, a blind recommendation based on recommendations I received:** I'm reading it right now, so I don't know how satisfying the ending will be, or how I'll be left feeling in general, but I've had extremely strong recommendations for the **Mistborn** series from friends based on my reading preferences.

It includes the horrible marshes with a heck ton of mosquitoes eating you, the weeks of fearful riding to get to somewhere safe. It includes the rhymes and songs of a world that's thousands of years old, gives you glimpses of a backcloth that expands far beyond the limited view you are getting through a hobbit's eyes. Just think: in the Mines of Moria, Gimli sings a song detailing a small part of the history of a whole race that was founded when the world began, whose story began before the first humans and elves even walked the Earth...and Sam simply responds, \"I like that,\" and they keep going.\n\nIt provides language and backdrop and explanation to our own world - think of the earlier more explained version of the 'cow jumped over the moon' nursery rhyme that Frodo sings in Bree's pub, the names that differ from race to race and region to region (Eomer versus Ghan-buri-ghan) - and retells the myths that our own world couldn't properly tell (why do you think so much of Kullervo is reflected in Turin Turmabar, so much of King Arthur in Aragorn and Durin?) to make our own world more real.\n\nLotR has adventure and pathos and eucatastrophe and so much more and it does it - this main tale of one ring and a couple of hobbits who set out to do the impossible - in a way that feels real (people die, people's lives are ruined, the world will never be the same....why else must Frodo go to the Grey Havens, the Elves leave Middle Earth, the fellowship break?), in a way that echoes the histories and stories of all these people...\n\nSaying that 'LotR drags on forever' is missing the point. No, there isn't a battle on every page. Yeah, it starts off a little slow. But...it's got it all. I can't even begin to convey how much I love LotR.

I also enjoyed The Rangers Apprentice, although I don\u2019t remember the author since it\u2019s been years.\n\nOne of the book sagas that got me into writing was definitely Warrior Cats, a series by a few women under the pseudonym Erin Hunter. It\u2019s a bit immature at first (not terribly so) but is very in depth and has many tiny little intricate stories. I think there are over 25 books now, so if you\u2019re having a hard time looking for new series after a while, that\u2019s definitely one you can hang onto for a while.\n\nHonestly I don\u2019t have much time for reading anymore but these are all good ones that give me sweet nostalgic vibes. Enjoy if you decide to read any! \u2764\ufe0f\n\nOH. WAIT. Forgot one of the best series fantasy novels I\u2019ve ever read by Christopher Paolini.

Langford dined out on the story for years, and professed (pseudo-) sorrow that nobody would ever read the rotten thing.*\n\n  \n*Well now you can.

The intestines rather resent their interior functions. They want to break out into the world, to live and love in the open air. (It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase \"communicating with your inner being\"). The bulk of the novel is made up of a series of set piece encounters between the rampant intestines and the populace at large.*\n\n  \n*Every intestinal joke you can think of and huge number that you can't think of and many that you wouldn't like to think of desecrate the text along with a lot of sly nudge, nudge, wink, wink digs at pseudo-scientific nut-cults, the reading room of the British Library and the sexual attractiveness of the Sphinx.

Make sure you keep your grades up, work in research labs on campus, find relevant volunteer opportunities, and pick your top 5 grad schools early so you will be prepared when it's time to apply.  \n\n\nIf you haven't started school yet at all, and the intersection of police and mental illness is something that is important to you, a transferrable associate's degree in criminal justice from a community college may be an option for you. It's also a good place to network with future law enforcement professionals, future attorneys, and others who may start their careers around the same time or slightly sooner than you (a lot of police officers just get the associate's degree, while aspiring attorneys still have to get through law school).  \n\n\nAlso, look into the field of forensic psychology/legal psychology. I had several psychology professors who have served as expert witnesses in the court system, and I even had the opportunity to take a course about the intersections of psychology and the law. My main professor who taught in this area got a Bachelor's in psychology and then completed a graduate degree that consisted of basically the first two (out of three) years of law school. I did not go the same route, so I don't know the exact details of these programs, but I thought it was a pretty cool option. Here is a link with more info on this career field:  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/witness/201409/forensic-psychology-is-it-the-career-me](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/witness/201409/forensic-psychology-is-it-the-career-me)   \n\n\nAn MSW is also an option, if you want to work either in direct advocacy or public policy. Having a master's degree or higher adds clout to your name in the field, and in a lot of ways frees you to design your own career field based directly on your interests and desires. You mention wanting to do something that seems along the lines of \"sensitivity training\" (not sure if they still call it that). With the right degrees and certifications, you could write all your own materials and run your own business. This is very similar to a goal I have, except I want to educate teachers on how to identify signs of abuse and mental illness in students. I'm currently trying to get into grad school so I can get started down that career path (sadly I am not qualified to teach teachers with just my BA in Psychology, even though I know very intimately what it looks like to be a kid with mental illness)."}, {"comment_id": "exy21qe", "post_id": "cuke6x", "comment": "I've been a mentor for vulnerable people in prisons for a good few years, go in with no assumptions, eyes wide open, and simply do your best"}, {"comment_id": "exy4ua2", "post_id": "cuke6x", "comment": "Yes!!

The total injustice was just too much for me to swallow, especially when she just accepted it like a doormat.  It's pretty clear that Jaime doesn't respect her anymore than he would a child from how he compared it to his own childhood beatings and at that point, I didn't respect her anymore either.

I still don't get the enjoyment from cooking that I used to and part of that is because I tried to push back into too fast. Take your time. Find something fun and self-contained. I think the suggestion of Stardust by Neil Gaiman is a great one. Good Omens by him and Terry Pratchett could also be good. I believe Good Omens is longer so it might be a better second book.

It's not exactly light hearted!  There is real tragedy and I definitely cried at least once in that series.  \n\n\n/u/litslens I can't recommend The Long Way to a Small, Angry Planet enough.  It's fascinating, but also really light hearted.  Plus, it's self-contained like /u/theotherkafka said.  There are 2 more books in the series but they follow different characters, so you can pretty much read them in any order.  \n\n\nRendezvous with Rama is a really good classic.  Lots of exploration on an an amazing alien vessel the size of a planet that kept me hooked without too much heavy, exhausting emotional stuff.  \n\n\nAlso, the Murderbot Diaries might be good.  I enjoyed them partially because I could kind of identify with the main character.  He mostly just wants to be left alone.  I honestly think he's depressed too and for some reason, dark comedy in that vein really resonates with me when I'm struggling myself!  I guess it makes me feel like I'm not alone and there's something encouraging about seeing other characters survive despite those heavy clouds hanging over them.  If they can do it,  so can I.  Plus, All Systems Red (the first one) is a novella, so it shouldn't be difficult to get through.\n\nEdit: /u/listlens, I just realized everything I suggested was scifi when you asked for fantasy or romance.  Sorry.  :( To make up for it, here are a few fantasy recommendations!\n\n\nDealing with Dragons is the first is a silly little quartet about a fairy tale princess who is sick of all the trappings that come with being a princess, so she goes off and gets herself a job as a dragon's princess (aka assistant.)\n\nAnything by Ilona Andrews is good.  They're a husband-wife author duo who write mostly urban fantasy.  My favorites by them are Clean Sweep and the Kate Daniels series.  \n\n\nThe Last Dragonlord is one of my all-time favorites.  It's a romantic fantasy about shapeshifting Dragons.  All of them have something that makes them... \"deformed\" or different in some way that marks them before they eventually grow into their dragon shapeshifting powers and the responsibility/title that goes with it, so it was satisfying having the outcasts become the powerful heroes.  For instance, the main hero has a birthmark on his face and another dragonlord was born with extra fingers, etc. \n\nAnd finally, Harry Potter is always good for a reread.  The best part is that the first few books are so lighthearted too."}, {"comment_id": "eko44my", "post_id": "bc08b2", "comment": "Came here to recommend Good Omens.

Dave finds that while he lost a foot or two in height, he somehow acquired a suit of armor and a badass beard. Julian's ears have grown ridiculously long and pointy. And Cooper... well Cooper has gotten himself a set of tusks, a pair of clawed hands, and a bad case of the shits. He also finds that he's carrying a bag with a human head in it - a head that he had chopped off when they were still just playing a game.\n\nShit just got real, and if they want to survive, these four friends are going to have to tap into some baser instincts they didn't even know existed in their fast-food and pizza delivery world.\n\nIt's fight, flight, or try to convince the people who are trying to kill them that they don't really exist."}, {"comment_id": "ekmxrd1", "post_id": "bc08b2", "comment": "Raven Cycle by Maggie Stiefvater myb\nOr Song of Achilles by Madeleine Miller (uhhh hope i spelled the names right)"}, {"comment_id": "ezstavl", "post_id": "d24ls0", "comment": "Maybe I'm missing something but I don't really see what this would achieve.

There are really touching and thought provoking stories in the book, it's definitely worth the read."}, {"comment_id": "f49f1f1", "post_id": "djrj87", "comment": "Slaughterhouse-Five by Kurt Vonnegut!"}, {"comment_id": "f481h1y", "post_id": "djrj87", "comment": "You might enjoy The Plague by Albert Camus.\n\nThe Road by Cormac McCarthy and Educated by Tara Westover are also really good."}, {"comment_id": "f482aa1", "post_id": "djrj87", "comment": "Red rising"}, {"comment_id": "f48368z", "post_id": "djrj87", "comment": "I\u2019m reading 1984 I suggest it"}, {"comment_id": "f48bkik", "post_id": "djrj87", "comment": "I would read East of Eden, or War and Peace.

I stumbled across it by accident when I was attempting to read . . . the other one . . . And I\u2019m so glad I did! Very cool concept about society in the future when people can only see one color and they\u2019re put into a caste system based upon which color they can see and to what percent they see it. There\u2019s supposed to be more coming, but I think the author has put them on the back burner, much to my dismay."}, {"comment_id": "f48lpej", "post_id": "djrj87", "comment": "If you're into dystopian stories, I enjoyed Octavia Butler's \"Parable of the Sower\" immensely: VERY entertaining but also thought-provoking.

I suggest Slaughterhouse Five to start, or Cat's Cradle. His writing style is engaging."}, {"comment_id": "f4a4wyv", "post_id": "djrj87", "comment": "You can try : 'Never let me go' by Kazuo Ishiguro, it requires a bit of patience.
