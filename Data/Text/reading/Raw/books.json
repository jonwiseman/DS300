My steadfast loyalty to the Republic party has been resolute due to my steadfast believe in a party platform of personal ethics, responsibility and freedom.  However a steadfast faith in free market economics (in general) should not be confused with a belief in market anarchy.\n\nThe nature of internet neutrality is not hostile to the free market unless we are absolutely devoid of nuance in our appreciation of the market.  Even a fan favorite Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, understood that there are certain protections for the spirit of free enterprise that must guarantee a de facto fair trading place if we can expect the merits of a free market to rule.\n\nConsumers do not have the power to choose a different supply if the majority of a primary resource is controlled by a de facto aristocracy like a fief who does not rely on the traditional rules we come to expect that allows clear winners and losers to emerge.  In smalltown Louisiana a simple matter of anti-business, anti-competitor practices carried out by super chains create an economic dependency where choice is robbed of the consumer, because a manipulation of resources guarantees that the success or failure of a local market is irrelevant, because national and international resources will be pumped into defeating competition until the consumer is left with only a single choice.\n\nThis Wal-Mart Effect is a dangerous possibility with the repeal of internet neutrality.  The internet in its earliest days was a luxury of those that could afford personal PCs, leisure time, and the chance to browse an emerging technology.  So much of our cultural, economic, and social strata is now definitively affected by our access to the internet.  Most of our president's decrees, in fact, are more accessible through the internet than traditional press means.\n\nAnd with this murky territory that the internet exists in, somewhere between a service and a utility, the Republican Party, as the majority holders in Congress and the \"face\" of current domestic policy, are in effect telling the people of the United States that this borderline utility, even our very access to the President's preferred method of communication, should be arbitrated by private holding gatekeepers.  This amounts to, quite literally, the digital age's equivalence of emerging railroad barons, who guarantee access for the few that enrich the already industrious elite, on the back of infrastructure that is consistently already facilitated by public means.\n\nThe repeal of internet neutrality is a matter that will, indisputably, occur in the future.  Aristocratic style monopolies have never existed in perpetuity and the dangerous tycoon fostering that the FCC's proposed revocation will insure guarantees that in time this FCC repeal *will* be overturned.\n\nHowever in that time the Republican Party will have suffered the irreparable damage of being the facilitators of this madness.  The historic damage will be done and after 8 years of the face of Democrats the Republicans, in their first year of power, will have tarnished their reputation so thoroughly that in future films casting directors will ask for Bella Lugosi look alikes to play the Republican leaders in biopics about this event.\n\nIf the Republican Party hopes to retain seats and my loyalty they must demonstrate that they believe in the principles of a fair market, not the creation of a nobility class that controls one of the most important means of communication and business in our time so that anti-capitalist exploits will keep us in a digital dark age.\n\nI implore you to use anything within your power to block this attempt to repeal net neutrality in the spirit of Republican values."}, {"comment_id": "dq6j60j", "post_id": "7en6do", "comment": "Is there anyway a guy in England can help??"}, {"comment_id": "dq6javw", "post_id": "7en6do", "comment": "How could this happen?

I am not sure if there has ever been an initiative so unpopular with the public, many times rebuked, yet that is nonetheless pushed forward, again and again, by giant corporate buaurocracies and corrupt officials.\n\n\nMany of the evils that killing off net neutrality would bring about have already been mentioned in many threads. The biggest one seems to be only glossed about though. In my view, the whole fight is primarily about the control of information flow. This is way bigger and way more important than, for example, charging fees for access, although that too is a part of the same game.\n\n\nControl of information can take very insidious forms. The goal is to dismantle the internet as a free for all competition of ideas where corporate powers (ISPs and their affiliates) do not have an automatic, insurmountable advantage. The game is not rigged enough in their favour, which is why we are seeing repeated attempts to move the goal posts. \n\n\nImagine a future internet where you are not able to create an accessible website or blog unless you sign an agreement that all content you put online will be reviewed by your ISP, and obviously confined to a list of pre-approved topics. If you want to stay afloat, you will be well advised to show proper ideological fervor by peppering your site with grassroots slogans such as: \"Comcast is great!\", \"Corporations are cuddly people\", or \"In ISP, we trust.\".

Because of this, Comcast can't roll into where Verizon is, and tiny startups can't roll into either of their territory, they instead lease the lines which are being used in the areas they don't control, if they offer services at all.  In addition, because of this, our internet speed average is markedly lower than other countries.

I have always been proud to be an American citizen, with our flaws and our strengths. This last year has been a shameful nightmare for the American people. The people in power and influence aren't even trying to be discreet with their selfish ambitions, and its the voters and citizens who will suffer for the benefit of someone else.\n\nNet Neutrality is not some evil scheme by the Democrats; Obama is not some sort of supervillain whose wake of terror and malice has to be repealed and cleaned up. The diversity between the two major political parties in this country is worse than ever. Politicians don't care to better this country for all, they only care about their team having the most points. It's a disgusting way to live and it hurts all of us. This current issue is only the most recent disgrace to come to the attention of Congress to pass through. There is no advantage to giving a handful of major ISP companies the right to extort money for access to the internet. There are countries that have free internet service and there are countries that consider internet access a basic human right these days. The United States won't even consider water a basic human necessity, for the sake of a company that won't spare any expense to make more money.\n\nRepealing Net Neutrality is just handing the keys to a daycare center to a famously aggressive and unsympathetic bully. These bullies want more control, more money, and they don't care who they have to harm to get it. The fact that multiple, countless fake identities were made to spread false information to promote the repealing of Net Neutrality should indicate that this is an evil, amoral and twisted idea that even its promoters are aware of. If this was good for the the people of this country at all, there would be actual support of it.\n\nI am so ashamed to have to live in a country where the people are going unheard, and blatantly self-serving laws are being passed. Net Neutrality is one idea that was already voted against, and here we are again, begging and pleading for some rational thought and compassion to find the hearts of the people that determine the fate of this country that we all live in.\n\nAre we citizens of this country, or are we marks for companies to take for all we have? Net Neutrality isn't even the beginning, but with every selfish law being passed that puts the boot to the necks of the citizens, we find ourselves inching closer to the end. This once great country may not even survive another ten years. I can barely see the light of hope in the darkness that grows greater every day.\n\nIf this law passes, and we the people are subject to the whims of a few greedy businesses, you may as well change \u201cWe the People\u201d to \u201cWe the Corporations.\u201d\n\nFor the love of decency, for the sake of a brighter future, for the chance that future generations may transform our country into a great nation once again, I beg you to see reason. Net Neutrality must not be repealed. Make me, and others, proud to be American citizens once again.\n\nOur current president vowed to make America great again.

Your ISP essentially becomes EA. The websites you thought would be included in the base price are hidden behind an additional paywall, except unlike Battlefront 2, you cant earn those websites over time.\n\nIf you don't think this would happen, look at the previous actions done by ISP's. Verizon has sued many times to allow data throttling, data preference, requiring Netflix to pay them a huge chunk of cash to allow for better streaming to customers, and so on. To make things worse, the current FCC chair is the previous top lawyer by Verizon, and it's clear he's still in cahoots with them.\n\nTLDR If the rules change, your internet will become like cable TV/Battlefront 2.

If it did, they would have done it before 2015, and they didn't.\n\n>Net neutrality is the basic principle that has made the Internet into what it is today\n\nNet neutrality is not a \"principle\", it's a set of unnecessary regulations. It was created in 2015...the internet was around for decades beforehand, so it's literally impossible for it to have \"shaped the internet\". It doesn't even exist outside the USA (news flash, the internet exists outside the USA).\n\n>It prevents big Internet Service Providers (like Verizon) from charging extra fees, engaging in censorship, or controlling what we see and do on the web by throttling websites, apps, and online services.\n\nMUH BIG INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS!!! Net neutrality prevents none of these things and there is no evidence supporting this claim. There is however ample evidence of liberal websites censorship of dissenters (like being banned for understanding the truth about NN).\n\n>the company has been spending millions on lobbying and lawsuits to kill net neutrality so they can gauge us all for more money.\n\nNo, they have been spending money to kill net neutrality because regulations kill business.\n\n\n>Only Congress has the power to stop Verizon's puppet FCC,\n>Ajit Pai is clearly still working for Verizon, not the public.\n\nSo this entire idiotic movement is based on a conspiracy theory.\n\n\n>People from across the political spectrum are outraged, \n\nJust the ignorant ones.\n\n\n\n\nMost arguments for NN and against its repeal are not evidence-based, but based on made up fearmongering scenarios that have never happened. Here I address some of the main talking points.\n\n>Net Neutrality was the unspoken but observed rules of the road in times past.\n\nNo it wasn't. It didn't exist before 2015. Even if it was the \"unspoken rules\", when were these \"unspoken rules\" broken, so that they suddenly needed to be codified into regulations in 2015?\n\nWhat you're saying doesn't even make sense. It's like saying Affirmative Action was the \"unspoken rule\" before 1961, and Kennedy just decided to make it a law for no reason. Labor laws were \"unspoken rules\" before being enacted! \n\nLaws and regulations are (and should be) made in response to things, not \"just because\". Affirmative action was implemented **in response** to racial discrimination. Labor laws were put into place **in response** to unfair employer practices. Net Neutrality was implemented for some reason **just because** it was an \"unspoken rule\" that was never broken? Please.\n\n>As bigger and bigger monopolies came to be ISPS (cable companies) they started to experiment monetizing the traffic\n\nNo they didn't.\n\n>Sure they can; look at neflix and Comcast. They basiclly proved it. \n\nNo they didn't.\n\n>Title 2 is there to stop providers from extorting companies and snuffing out small players. \n\nNo it's not. Title 2 is an anti-discrimination clause specifically designed to prevent racial discrimination by phone carriers (it was written in 1934).\n\nTitle II: **SEC. 202. [47 U.S.C. 202] DISCRIMINATION AND PREFERENCES. (a) It shall be unlawful for any common carrier to make any unjust or unreasonable discrimination in charges, practices, classifications, regulations, facilities, or services for or in connection with like communication service, directly or indirectly, by any means or device, or to make or give any undue or unreasonable preference or advantage to any particular person, class of persons, or locality, or to subject any particular person, class of persons, or locality to any undue or unreasonable prejudice or disadvantage.**\n\nTaken in context, Title II is 100% about racism and preventing phone companies from discriminating against black people. Simple. It's irrelevant in 2017 and there is no evidence it's needed. It should be easy to gather such evidence, there was no net neutrality before 2015. So show me this time when ISP's were unscrupulously charging fees for some services and not for others...the so called justification for Title II in 2017...i'm waiting.\n\n>Service providers would love to do it like mobile with metered Internet and data caps on customers,\n\nThey already do that. Net Neutrality doesn't prevent ISP's from metering data or implementing data caps across all users. Comcast already has a 1TB data cap.\n\n>then extort money from Internet sites at the same time.\n\nProve it.\n\n>This is about monopolies extending their physical access into a tax on our culture and speech. They must be regulated because they will try to tax every packet then turn that power into propaganda to keep the sheep in line.\n\nProve it.\n\n\nBy definition (for the sheep) -\n\nNet Neutrality = regulations\n\nRemoving regulations = opening internet\n\nPlacing regulations = restricting internet\n\nPretty simple. Unless you are the former FCC chair, then NET NEUTRALITY IS NOT REGULATIONS, ITS LIKE THE FIRST AMENDMENT!!

What I do is basically flick through the books to check nothing is in there (no notes etc.), record the details in a book, put it in a see through bag, attach a yellow label etc etc. I also make the visitor fill out a handing in books form.

The book dealt with childhood and adulthood \u20131958 and Grown Ups. The grown ups don\u2019t remember their childhood. None of us remember what we did as children\u2013we think we do, but we don\u2019t remember it as it really happened. Intuitively, the Losers knew they had to be together again. The sexual act connected childhood and adulthood. It\u2019s another version of the glass tunnel that connects the children\u2019s library and the adult library. Times have changed since I wrote that scene and there is now more sensitivity to those issues.* \n\nMy take on it. \n\n>I wasn\u2019t really thinking of the sexual aspect of it.\n\nI don't even know what to say here. I totally get the artistic reasoning for doing things (not this though) and the like but I don't see how you could write a gang bang of kids and just think nothing of the sex. \n\n>The sexual act connected childhood and adulthood.\n\nThey could have done something else to signify that. Ben could have brought a cigar or a nip of whisky and they all had a go at that. Their dialogue afterwards and perspectives written afterwards could have shown the connection. \n\n>. Times have changed since I wrote that scene and there is now more sensitivity to those issues.\n\nUh King as much as I love you. 99% of the population never has been for child gang bangs. \n\nIt's a horror book about child murder, so the murder is expected, kid gang bangs not so much. The part that makes the book scary isn't the clown per se it's the fact that kids are being killed; no one wants to float. So his comment about \"only paying attention to the gang bang\" is odd. It's like dude if someone served you a dinner of steak, potato and then put a scoop of shit on your steak. You're not going to talk about how your upset that the shit was on the steak.

We read 3-4 books every night (pending behaviour- if she stuffs around and wastes time, she loses a story) snuggled up in an old rocking chair before I tuck her into bed. These books are SHORT. I'm talking ~5 minutes to read per book. But its enough to get her into a calm mental place and (usually) make bedtime relatively smooth. I have made reading a book part of the routine- i started at just one (goodnight moon) - before bed every night since she was about 2 months old. Bear in mind,  I'm pretty frigging disorganized and NOT a routine person- but the one thing I thought was manageable was, after I had eaten my dinner, I got her into a clean nappy and clean pjs, made sure she was clean and dry, read her a story and cuddled/fed her to sleep. \n\n\nWhen she comes into my bed for a cuddle in the morning, she usually brings a book for us to read together; and we bring a book to read on the bus when we go to daycare. When she is playing independently in a safe area,  I try to stay off my phone and read a book (mind you, I dont always succeed at this...).\n\n\nBooks are a major part of her day, and seem to be one of her favourite parts.

Here's a few things:\n\n- \"Goodwill\" is a legal \"thing\", it's not just warm fuzzies. It means that the BRAND of Reading Rainbow, which was created by hundreds of writers, technicians, painters, camera operators, directors, producers and yes, even executives - belongs to the organization known as WNED, which may still be employing many of those people. WNED has a right to the \"brand value\" (aka Good Will) associated with that creative work. \n\n- Burton is a professional ACTOR, which means that he sold his own likeness and the rights to it for money, under contract, specifically in association with the creation of moving images of him saying certain things during each episode, including the catchphrase \"don't take my word for it.\"  Those words were intentionally crafted by another person, read by Burton in front of a camera, his likeness was captured, and he was paid. \n\n- Burton is FREE to say the phrase anywhere, that's Constitutional Law.  But he is likely STILL bound by contract not to stand in front of a camera, reading from a WRITTEN SCRIPT and say \"don't take my word for it\" - that's theft of Intellectual Property. \n\nThink about it, he's NOT \"just hanging out\" chatting onscreen, he's generating creative work for the intent of collecting money, and he intends to use it for his own gain with no consideration to the people at WNED who originally dedicated their lives (and probably took lesser pay) to build a loving show about reading for kids. He's not suddenly thinking \"I should say 'don't take my word for it'\" - no; he and a bunch of OTHER writers, producers, and executives sat around a table looking at a script and someone said, \"should LeVar say 'don't take my word for it' here?\" ... they probably debated, and decided \"screw it, yes. Let's do it.\" Then cameras rolled. This isn't warm, it's douchy. \n\n- the article SEEMS to indicate that there was a prior LICENSING agreement. That mean he and his lawyers KNOW and AGREED that even though the show was over, the rights to the creative work of Reading Rainbow were the property of WNED. \n\n- odds are that the new group is in a licensing dispute with WNED who wants different things, or creative control, over the extension work (the product intended for Netflix use). \n\nThis is all kinda like if Michael Jordan said, \"I'm gonna create a new shoe line called 'Mikes', and the tagline is \"just shoe it.\" \n\nThis isn't about LeVar vs big bad WNED; it's actually probably more about crappy new company trying to steal from little public television company. I almost wonder if the article or OP aren't associated in some way. \n\nDisclaimers: I'm not a lawyer. I'm not associated with this. They are both wrong and both right.

If a rapist can go to prison and have privileges that consider them productive and reformed individuals after a set number of years, this should be up to the effected of the crime. While some might say justice is blind, the nature of a crime that is where harm is done to another without consideration of their human rights, the law deems time without freedoms as the justice for all but; freedom of mind and depravity of management of time in confinement allows for maintaining of sanity and an allowance of the humanity neglected by their acts.\n\nIf an act is done of ignorance and considers the harmed to be less than human, humanity is an allowance given to those who once looked at another person and decided to pursue an act as if they were less than an object. While I would say crimes of passion where harm is done by harm in kind, it would depend on severity on both ends and a moral non-blind choice on ones decisions. For instance, a rapest, a serial killer, or a significant other walking in on an act of cheating; I would see the third as less than the other two in severity because a bond of the heart can break a person when the bond is broken by those they love most. The first two are different in my opinion because they looked at an innocent, without morality and did so inhumanly. While it can be argued that one is no better than the other and ends don't justify means, I would argue the world is already too blind seeing no difference in cause or effect and affords without concern while looking at a individual case without emotion to make it equal for a group it is not justice.\n\nLike when a person says their taxes shouldn't pay for social security and labels anyone on the program as a freeloader. It is a program that is in place for those who need it for survival as they could not without it. Without knowing what one person is going through and knowing they could be denied survival, this is a bias of grouping in favor of ones self gain. If the life of another is defined by dollar value despite human concern, it's no better than killing for profit. Law can be better blind but should always be independent of one another and should use moral bias in all cases as making crime blind equally distributes definition of crime by letter and not by the crime itself.

The antagonists are almost always wrong in their sense of thinking and actions, but good writing shows both perspectives. It might not be very effective, but it might help criminals think more broadly and think about others perspectives, which might reduce crime in the long-term."}, {"comment_id": "dvhv0or", "post_id": "83fiet", "comment": "Why don't the tend of thousands of people that are all for the reformation of the prison and judicial system, like many of this people in this thread, get together and begin to organize to make the changes that are truly needed?

It\u2019s so simple folks, all of these issues are called conflicts of interest.  In this case we have the private prison lobby influencing (successfully it seems) to increase their bottom line (prisoners in custody longer) at the expense of any intention  of rehabilitating those that haven\u2019t committed unforgivable offenses.  I get that this particulate incidence is not that egregious or exciting, it\u2019s just another file on the pile confirming what I already know.\n\nThese conflicts are evident throughout civil society, and government/regulators are there to help folks from being constantly bamboozled by those that are inclined to prey on the weak.  They aren\u2019t always perfect and often they could  benefit from bipartisan improvement (welfare, ACA, SSN, Workman\u2019s Comp, etc) but these programs and agencies are there for GOOD reason.  It\u2019s just one party is NEVER acting in good faith.  Instead of trying to solve these problems or contribute towards realistic solutions, conservatives just want to ignore them as long as they aren\u2019t their own, despite the petulance and dishonesty of that strategy.\n\nBefore the SEC came along and the two Securities acts were written in to law, snake oil salesman had an entirely different (very real and present) meaning.  We now have rules in place to prevent simple fraud as it relates to business and banking.  There are literally endless examples to cite of the government coming in to forcibly advocate for the masses and introduce regulation or legislation to address a gap in the wake of a bamboozling. \n\nChrist, look at what cigarette companies got away with for years and Alcohol companies still get away with.  Look at what Round Up is on trial for right now.  It\u2019s all the same folks. It\u2019s a giant cat and mouse game of identifying conflicts that criminals exploit and then reeling the exploiters in through broad sweeping changes to protect the public.  Think bank Bailout, flood insurance, vaccines, etc.  We, the people should always be priority number one for our elected representatives.\n\nPrivate business men don\u2019t want the government to interfere in their business because of a few bad apples regardless of whether it is best for the flock because their interests are often short sited and selfish.  Unfortunately,  that logic is also short sided as all relevant parties must comply for changes to work and one party always just wants to take their ball  and go home, in fact I\u2019m not sure what else they really stand for .  \n\nThese people support conservative political parties, and in the US, religion is the typical common denominator.  They are promised over and over that all of their problems are caused by THEM and the only way to deal with it is by neutering of THEM (from power, from politics, etc.);  this inherently challenges the core principals of Democracy (oh the irony).  \n\nMeanwhile, the adults in the room are just tying to get poor people in Flint some drinking water, keep kids out of tent cities, and have a respectable leader in the Whitehorse.  It\u2019s not hard folks, there are some people that want the Fox to run the henhouse and others that think the Hens should have a say also.  It really is that basic.  Generally speaking , the left wants a say, and the right says they know what\u2019s best for us....despite years worth of indisputable evidence directly to the contrary.\n\nRant complete."}, {"comment_id": "ek1hyrk", "post_id": "b900zn", "comment": "Typical"}, {"comment_id": "ek1izjj", "post_id": "b900zn", "comment": "Just emailed the prison administrator about it.

I've sometimes thought maybe they don't. I apologise if I come across ignorant or stupid, I actually have autism and I'm pretty sure I have numeric dyslexia as I seem incapable of remembering numbers or the order they're in, and sometimes they change from what they were before.. which is obviously not possible, my brain just thinks they've changed. I've even sometimes, say with editing, I've got my footage on the second row and I'm asking the lecturer why I can't do the thing we're supposed to be doing, turns out my footage is on the third row. It needs to be on the second row, but I was looking at my footage on the second row, acknowledging it was the second row because it had the number 2. I didn't realise it was on the third, with a number 3, until it was pointed out to me. \n\nAnyway my point is I have this divergent thing y'know, and sometimes people curiously ask me about how things are different for me. And now I'm on the other end, I'm just curious what is it like reading a book? Weirdly letters and words have always come naturally to me, could read easy as pie since I was three, and when I was younger I was baffled by my classmates who couldn't pronounce simple words, couldn't read properly, I didn't understand it because to me it was just so natural, and then conversely I'm pretty useless with numbers which is why I think it's weird that reading is so natural to me. So, do you actually see the letters move? Or is it just like you see the word as something and then suddenly it's something else and you're like \"I coulda' sworn that said ...\"? That's what happens to me with numbers. It's like it just changes without me physically seeing it change. Or is it like, your brain takes a longer time to process the letters into a word in your head?\n\nI do believe dyslexia is considered somewhat similar to autism actually, or that it's a similar condition. Apparently from what I have read, dyslexic people actually tend to be very creatively gifted, imaginative, very intelligent, just that the brain takes longer to process reading. I believe there are other symptoms too.. here you go I found the link I was looking at several weeks ago.. https://www.dyslexia.com/about-dyslexia/signs-of-dyslexia/test-for-dyslexia-37-signs/\n\nSo this lists a lot of other symptoms of dyslexia aside from the difficulty reading, which I find interesting.

"}, {"comment_id": "dsiy0lf", "post_id": "7po48g", "comment": "Book Store employee here. I understand the need to keep contraband out of the prison, but that's why we have put such great lengths to work with the prisons.\n\nWhen I first started this is how we sent books to prisons:\n\n1. Friend or family member of inmate came into the store and spoke with a salesperson about which books they wanted.\n\n2. After settling the list of desired books sales person would order the books to be sent directly from our warehouse to the prison. There was absolutely no room for contraband to be smuggled into the book.\n\nThe problem with this one?  Our warehouses would sometimes use UPS and sometimes use USPS. There were some prisons which would only accept USPS packages and would return the book or just not deliver it to the inmate.\n\nAfter we threw this method out we experimented with a lot of different methods at once it seems.\n\nWe encouraged customers to have a print of of the prison's mail rules so we would know EXACTLY how to comply with them, but this maybe worked twice. Most people coming in are embarrassed about having a loved one in prison and just want to get the books sent, not do homework before shopping. (Because I've picked up on this embarrassment so often one of the first things I do now is reassure the person that they've come to the right person because I do this ALL THE TIME. It seems to put them at ease that others have to do the same thing.)\n\nHere's how to do prison deliveries now (We ended up having to take the strictest rules from all of the experimental methods to make sure every prison would get every package to the inmate without fuss.):\n\n\n1. Friend or family member of the inmate comes into the store and speaks with a salesperson about which books they want.\n\n2. Sales person makes sure that the customer has a membership with the store. If they don't we inform them that all people wishing to send books to correctional facilities must have a membership. This is actually good for both sides for multiple reasons.\n\n             a. A membership gets the customer free shipping and handling. As most people come in to do this several times a year, this usually ends up saving them money in the long run even though the membership has a cost.\n             b. Now that they are on file we have their name, phone number, and mailing address. It gives us a way to contact the customer if any hiccups happen after they leave.\n             c. It helps us save a bit of money on the extra costs that prison deliveries have come to have.\n \n3. After store membership is confirmed, and after settling on the list of desired books, the sales person orders the books to be sent directly from our warehouse to the STORE. This means there's no way for contraband to be smuggled, and since we at the store level can't communicate with the warehouses which shipping method to use, we have it sent to us and then we send it out again using USPS. (Which all prisons seems to accept.)\n\n3. We have the customer write down the shipping address in their own handwriting. We had too many troubles with computers reformatting the addresses and making the package go nowhere and with people guessing the addresses, getting it wrong, and blaming it on us. Now, IT'S YOUR HANDWRITING! WE DIDN'T DO IT!\n\n4. Sales person takes a picture of the order details, the customer's membership information, and the shipping address and texts it to every manager to keep an eye out for.\n\n5. Sales person prints a copy of the receipt, staples it to the shipping address, and puts it on a cork board in the office at the end of their shift.\n\n6. When the package arrives at the store, we notify a manager that a prison deliver package has arrived. Once we've located which receipt matches either the contents of the box or the name on the shipping receipt, we double check that all items are present. If not all the items are present we keep the package individually wrapped in the locked office until the rest arrives. If all item are present we remove the old shipping information and replace it with the shipping information that the customer left with us and use our rubber stamp of the store's address as the return address to let prison mail inspectors know that this really did come from a retailer, not an individual.\n\n7. The next day after we go to the bank we drop off all prison delivery packages with the USPS post office.\n\n\nAll that to say, that if a store is willing to go through all that, I think any prison should count them as an approved retailer and let anyone send books to any inmate."}, {"comment_id": "dsirtum", "post_id": "7po48g", "comment": "It takes a special kind of scumbag to see a bunch of prisoners reading and think \"how can we wring some profit from this?\""}, {"comment_id": "dsiq3vt", "post_id": "7po48g", "comment": "The prison industry looking at any option to squeeze another dime out of someone.

It's also proven that treatment and rehabilitation help more than throwing you in a cage with other criminals. Our prison system does not prevent crime whatsoever, it is easier to find drugs in prison then outside of it. The USA has the highest prison population in the world. These prison systems make huge amounts of money off of the taxpayers, many are privately owned by companies such as \"Corrections Corporation of America\" and etc.. The way our prison system in the USA works is by promoting crime, and giving the inmates a mentality of \"I won't get caught next time\" when getting caught in today's age is almost certain.. It's sickening to see such huge amounts of wealth propping up the authoritative branch of our government by encouraging crime, and portraying jail time or prison sentences as something sexually attractive on the television. If you've ever been in a big police department, talk to them about private prison's. Their answer will be \"well someone's got to own them!\" and then they probably won't like you as much after you ask that. The police in this country, and most countries for that matter, is much like the military, or other fraternities. There are unwritten rules that apply. It is very much a fraternal institution, and you bet your ass the police would much rather you go to jail than anything negative come to them. I've been beaten and bullied by the police, and I have a clean record. Not to say they're all bad, because they aren't, but they are the one's directly protecting these institutions.\n\nA coworker of mine told me that in prison how they would sneak in drugs, etc.. There were so many ways. One of his most creative ways he told me was meth via birthday cards. They would heat up a bunch of meth and disolve it in water, put it in a spray bottle and then spray a birthday card with it until it's saturated, and let it dry. Then send it. You would just eat little pieces of the birthday card lol. \n\n[Here's a chart from the Government showing crime stats for incarceration - with drug offenses being at 46.3% and an OVERWHELMING MAJORITY OF ALL CRIMES](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_offenses.jsp)"}, {"comment_id": "dsivu4f", "post_id": "7po48g", "comment": "That sucks.

He was an enormous part of my childhood. \n\nI live near Seattle, and before he passed away, my grandfather made it a tradition to take me every December to see the PNWB's The Nutcracker. The sets and costumes that I marvelled over and dreamed of as a child were designed and created by none other than Maurice Sendak. Recently, the whole show got redesigned, which breaks my heart, but I was lucky enough to attend the final showing of his creation.\n\nAlso, when I was in Kindergarten, I actually had the pleasure of meeting him. He came to my elementary school to talk to us about his illustrations and read us Where the Wild Things Are. At the end of the assembly, they did a raffle for the students to win a signed copy of the book, and I won, so I got to shake his hand and talk to him briefly. I told him about how I loved to draw, and he told me that even if I didn't want to just draw when I grew up, I should never stop doing it because it will always bring me great joy.

But part-way through, he began to hear that the North had started a war to free enslaved people like him. A few days after Confederate General Robert E. Lee surrendered in April 1865, Lewis says that a group of Union soldiers stopped by a boat on which he and other enslaved people were working and told them they were free.\n\n>Lewis expected to receive compensation for being kidnapped and forced into slavery, and was angry to discover that emancipation didn\u2019t come with the promise of \u201cforty acres and a mule,\u201d or any other kind of reparations. Frustrated by the refusal of the government to provide him with land to live on after stealing him away from his homeland, he and a group of 31 other freepeople saved up money to buy land near the state capital of Mobile, which they called Africatown.\n\nEdit: More excerpts from the interview in this Vulture article, courtesy of /u/lee61.\n\nhttp://www.vulture.com/2018/04/zora-neale-hurston-barracoon-excerpt.html\n\nThe interviews were conducted over three months with a man named Cudjo Lewis, or Kossula, his original name, the last survivor of the last slave ship to land on American shores.

It's just that it isn't necessary to explore this in every piece of fiction we create and consume.

GRR Martin is telling a pretty typical fantasy story with pretty typical story arcs... The difference is that his style obscures who is essential.   Ned and Robb were never essential.  You could make this entire series into a 2 hour movie telling Jon's unlikely hero journey from unknown bastard to \"Prince who was Promised\", but it would be less interesting. In-fact, I believe movie studios pitched that exact idea to GRR Martin before HBO came along.  What makes Game of Thrones compelling is that it allows time to magnify secondary characters like Robb Stark that gives more context to Jons typical hero journey.   People mostly get confused by the method of telling the story.  For instance, I don't think Dany is essential to the conclusion of this story.  I would not at all be shocked if she was the last great \"shocking\" death.  She's served her purpose of re-introducing Dragons to the world - and if she died it would not impact Jon's end game.  Ultimately in a condensed movie versions, you'd have to quickly explain how Jon acquires Dragons for his final showdown with the white walkers, but it could be done without Dany.\n\nWith this season on the verge of confirming the longstanding R+L=J theory, and that theory essentially forming the backbone of this entire series (there's no other reason for us to be peaking into this specific pocket of time), I'm not going to be surprised unless Jon snow is officially killed off.  He's the Luke Skywalker of this story.  What makes Game of Thrones unique is that they give several secondary characters the same treatment.  People misinterpret GRR Martin as being \"random\", but that's precisely what makes it so original - that he has razzledazzled the audience so thoroughly that they can't distinguish the main character from an extra.  It would be like if Star Wars had been a 7 season TV show where you spent the first few seasons thinking Luke Skywalker was just some random recruit to the rebellion and the main character was one of the random imperial officers who was force-choked to death by Vader midway through the third season.\n\n**TL;DR:  Game of Thrones is unique, because GRR Martin gives secondary characters the same attention as those core to the story.  It would be like if the original Star Wars movies were a 7 season HBO Show where you spent the first 3 seasons thinking [Biggs Darklighter](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/Biggs_Darklighter) was the key hero on the show.  His death at the Battle of Yavin would break alt-universe Twitter.**"}, {"comment_id": "d391ldz", "post_id": "4jr8zr", "comment": ">\u00a0then maybe you should quit right now and learn computer science.

This is my *opinion*, and opinions are not always shared.\n\n**kill your darlings** <---- I give this advice more than I care too, because I fall into the trap of keeping my characters too protected at times, and this destroys the tension which readers need in order to maintain their interest.  It is healthy to have characters die when the situation requires it.  However, you can go too far with this mentality, until killing characters become the panacea for all waning interest.  \n\nKilling characters off all the time isn't realistic.  Yes, heroes die in battle too, but as writers we are not dealing with just raw reality.  Otherwise there would be no difference between fiction, nonfiction, and repair manuals.  We largely deal with metaphorical and philosophical ideals, which our characters represent, running the emotional and visceral gamut.\n\nAlso, killing characters off shows arbitrary concern for the people who exist solely in the universe you have created.  While they may not be real, the situations concerning them should be.  Characters have to be believable-this is what I mean by weak/strong writing.\n\nFor example.  There are so many instances where one of the Fellowship of the Ring should have just taken an orc arrow to the neck and bled out.  That would be realistic.  Frodo should have died of exposure.  But you'll note that Boromir and Gandalf only died when it served a purpose to the plot, and underlined a moral virtue or deficit which made the reader think.  While this is not *realistic*, it is what makes the writing strong and compelling, and allows characters to endure in our minds as though they were actual people, and not disposable caricatures.\n\nAnyway, such is my *opinion*, food for thought.  Feel free to disagree"}, {"comment_id": "d39i5s1", "post_id": "4jr8zr", "comment": "Except that most of the characters don't die in the middle of battle, they die from constant betrayals and backstabbings.

This schtick of his can make the reading a cheap game of guessing who dies next."}, {"comment_id": "d391abh", "post_id": "4jr8zr", "comment": "It's interesting that he considers this truth...  In the quote he talks about the need for truth and honesty when writing about war and conflict which requires death - almost as if it is part of the requirement for the genre. Considering he's writing about a world with magic, dragons, undead and resurrection I wonder how he reconciles being truthful with what he includes in his fantasy. There only appears to be a need for truth in his writing when he feels the need for a moral or ethical commentary.        \n    \nYou can see his need for what he considers moral, ethical, and economic neutrality in his book but it seems very specific to his focuses...  Attractiveness, sex, death, power, lust, gender roles, etc.  Two of the most physically attractive (and for a time) powerful characters are incestuous lovers who lose their power and are maimed (emotionally and/or physically). The most powerful female character (a warrior) he describes in a fairly unattractive physical manner. One of the more witty / interesting / self-aware characters is a dwarf. A seemingly truly good and well-intention protagonist is beheaded. One of his younger interesting female characters is riddled with pride and need for revenge. Another young female is naive and severely abused.   \n    \nSince we don't explore the commentary of dragons, magic, and undead I wonder how he views all this? For example, there is a commentary on having magic in the world, and people's belief systems, that goes beyond it giving them power or direction. We seem to be pretty loose with gods and the afterlife considering there is resurrection and destiny/prophesy in this world.  Is he suggesting that god doesn't exist because he has ignored or effectively created a universe without it?  What about the existence of undead?\n     \nThis makes GRRM much more unique than many fantasy authors who really pitch a cause, discuss good and evil, and create or infer clear distinctions between everything. It creates an amazing amount of diversity in his writing I find it limiting having read all his GoT books:  I have come to expect his need for balance to the point where I am genuinely surprised when things are not muddled and complicated...  It's an interesting take on morality because even his supporting cast of characters are almost never straightforward, well- or bad- intended people.  I this intentional on his part? Do all our heroes have to be this complicated and often morally ambiguous?    \n    \nI find myself thinking about how he wants / needs us to like and dislike everyone we're reading about.  Everyone has to have a complimentary amount of heroic and villainous behavior.  Doing \"good\" must have some self-interest you're not only made aware of but has to be a little disgusting.  If someone has helped a kingdom and gotten rich there is often a much more manipulative, evil, destructive side to them, etc.  Virtue must be taken if we're going to read about it.\n\nWhat about the people who walked into getting rich?  Doing the right thing or the wrong thing by being at the right/wrong place at the right/wring time?  Who ended up in power by working hard?  Why don't we ever at least see mentioned someone helping the poor, righting a wrong, or murdering someone who isn't some complicated, Shakespearean character?  What about the boring people - most of us - who are just going about our lives. People like this exist in the real-world, where war and death exist, just going about their lives trying to muddle on through.  They are part of the truth and honesty of life and death. On the other hand, there are also people on the side of terrible things - genocide, racism, antisemitism who are doing what they believe is right.   Someone doesn't have be an evil dictator just so we can see how much he loves his wife at night.\n    \nMy commentary on his writing is the lack of the mundane and dichotomy of his characters. The lack of the background and tapestry of the every day that should intersect with these people.  You're either a nameless, barely mentioned butler in a castle or the butler in the castle who is running the place, getting rich, destroying and influencing lives, etc.    \n    \nAs I see it, the \"truth\" that GRRM needs is his heroes and villains to die, often grandiosely, to justify their existence in the world he's created. I don't think he's having them die because war and conflict aren't safe. Otherwise, every once in a while someone would actually just take a stray arrow or fall off a cliff or get caught in a fire and in some truly insignificant fashion, just die like they do in war.  People seem to die for GRRM because that is part of the balance/commentary he is always looking for in his writing independent of it being the \"grim realities of war.\"\n\n\n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "d38vsc7", "post_id": "4jr8zr", "comment": "And we greatly appreciate it George.\n\nBut every once in a while...its ok to let a hero live a bit longer.\n\n*Edit*: Good points about recent character-plot-armor.

Here's a snapshot I recovered using the [Internet Archive:](https://web.archive.org/web/20180722200130/https://www.forbes.com/sites/panosmourdoukoutas/2018/07/21/amazon-should-replace-local-libraries-to-save-taxpayers-money/)\n\n-----\n\n**Amazon Should Replace Local Libraries to Save Taxpayers Money**  \n^(Panos Mourdoukoutas, Contributor)  \n^(Jul 21, 2018, 09:00am  #GettingBuzz)  \n\n\nAmazon should open their own bookstores in all local communities. They can replace local libraries and save taxpayers lots of money, while enhancing the value of their stock. \n\nThere was a time local libraries offered the local community lots of services in exchange for their tax money. They would bring books, magazines, and journals to the masses through a borrowing system. Residents could borrow any book they wanted, read it, and return it for someone else to read.\n\nThey also provided residents with a comfortable place they could enjoy their books. They provided people with a place they could do their research in peace with the help of friendly librarians. Libraries served as a place where residents could hold their community events, but this was a function they shared with school auditoriums. There's no shortage of places to hold community events.\n\nLibraries slowly began to service the local community more. Libraries introduced video rentals and free internet access. The modern local library still provides these services, but they don't have the same value they used to. The reasons why are obvious.\n\nOne such reason is the rise of \"third places\" such as Starbucks. They provide residents with a comfortable place to read, surf the web, meet their friends and associates, and enjoy a great drink. This is why some people have started using their loyalty card at Starbucks more than they use their library card.\n\nOn top of this, streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime have replaced video rentals. They provide TV and movie content to the masses at an affordable rate. Actual video rental services like Blockbuster have gone completely out of business.\n\nThen there's the rise of digital technology. Technology has turned physical books into collector's items, effectively eliminating the need for library borrowing services.\n\nOf course, there's Amazon Books to consider. Amazon have created their own online library that has made it easy for the masses to access both physical and digital copies of books. Amazon Books is a chain of bookstores that does what Amazon originally intended to do; replace the local bookstore. It improves on the bookstore model by adding online searches and coffee shops. Amazon Go basically combines a library with a Starbucks.\n\nAt the core, Amazon has provided something better than a local library without the tax fees. This is why Amazon should replace local libraries. The move would save taxpayers money and enhance the stockholder value of Amazon all in one fell swoop.\n\nMy recent book *The Ten Golden Rules Of Leadership* is published by AMACOM, and can be found here *[Amazon sales link redacted]*.\n\n-----\n\n**Edit:** Restored the last line of the article without the Amazon link, per /r/books rule #3."}, {"comment_id": "e2xdrmh", "post_id": "91diyd", "comment": "What I find most disturbing is they were willingly pushing privatizing an iconic public service.

Through a program like Scholastic, you can skip that step and choose/buy books directly.\n\nIf someone knows that the books Dolly's program gets are different/better, then that would be a difference and a reason to use the middleman.

The news is constantly telling us to be afraid, 24/7 - there's a wildfire, Trump is ruining the country, Russians are hacking our elections, etc.  Additionally, the news does a very poor job of telling us what are actual, likely risks (for example, the odds of your kid getting snatched off the street by a stranger are, quite literally, 1 in a million.  It almost never happens.)  We take on the anxiety of others as our own, even though our own ability to affect the change is limited.\n2. We raised a whole generation with helicopter parents.  Beyond just participation trophies and everyone's a winner mentalities, we shielded an entire generation of kids from failures or risks of any kind.  We called teachers when the kids didn't do well in school, demanding the grades be changed.  We wouldn't let the kids go outside because of our fears they would be abducted.  We solved their problems with bullies or mean girls for them.  We did their projects for them.  As a result, they never learned to cope with failure or set-backs...and there is plenty of failure and set-backs in the real world as an adult.\n3. We oversold 4-year college to the same generation, while underselling things like plumbing, electrical work, mechanical work, carpentry.  And we doubled down by telling them that the name recognition of the college was paramount.  No wonder people are anxious when they graduate with $250K in student loans and they're unemployable because they got a degree in Gender Studies or English Literature.\n4. We are creating problems for ourselves.  The plastic straw thing is a perfect example.  While yes, using less plastic is better for the environment, this is where the government has focused its time and effort instead of in places like getting the homeless off the streets (for example).\n5. Others around us are anxious for the reasons listed above.  It's hard to be calm when everyone around you is anxious.  We're herd animals...when the herd spooks, we as individuals also spook.  But unlike most herd animals, someone in California can spook the herd in NYC using TV, radio, or internet.\n6. Finally, as always, people want the quick fix.  So they buy a book, or some pills, or do a single session with a yoga instructor or life coach.  I have news for you if you're one of the people buying these books - the books won't solve your problem alone.

In the period immediately following Marilyn Monroe\u2019s suicide, for example, the rate of suicide in the United States increased 12 percent. If you are hungry and see a restaurant, you\u2019re likely to go in. If you\u2019re suicidal and read about a suicide, you\u2019re likely to take the final step. It seems clear that a reduction in reporting on suicide would lower the suicide rate. At the moment, evidence suggests that even the best\\-intentioned suicide\\-prevention programs often introduce the idea of suicide to a vulnerable population; it seems possible that they actually increase the suicide rate.\n\n>Many depressives never become suicidal. Many suicides are committed by people who are not depressed. The two subjects are not parts of a single lucid equation, one occasioning the other. They are separate entities that frequently coexist, each influencing the other...Suicidality has been treated as a symptom of depression when it may in fact be a problem that coexists with depression. We no longer treat alcoholism as a side effect of depression: we treat it as a problem that occurs simultaneously with depression. Suicidality is at least as independent of the depressions with which it often coincides as is substance abuse."}, {"comment_id": "e0ccilt", "post_id": "8pj759", "comment": "Most celebrity deaths don't affect me too much, but this year has been brutal.

"}, {"comment_id": "e0c7835", "post_id": "8pj759", "comment": "In times like these, with sorrow and celebration in equal measure, for my own sake but perhaps in a way that someone on the random internet will appreciate, I will tell my Tony story.  \n\nI grew up in a place not unlike Leonia NJ where Anthony did, except it was much later in time and nowhere close to a cool city like NY.  My family never had enough money to travel the world and so I grew up, happy and content with no complaints, but no passion for travel or desire to reach outside my comfort zone.  I certainly didn't have the stones to do things like drop out of school and pursue my true passions like Tony.  Instead, I went through college, having a blast and never even know Bourdain existed.  \n\nWhen I met my wife, I was 23 and still did not have a passport, nor any real desire to get one.  To this my then girlfriend was aghast, insisting that the world was where I needed to be.  I had lasted 23 happy years without going to more than Canada, the US was great and grand and had treated me well, why bother?  Similarly, she was absolutely disgusted with my narrow range of food experiences.  Needless to say, I was a bit of a project for her.  I was also not exactly easy to convince.  Getting on a plane across the ocean to countries that didn't speak English quite frankly scared the crap out of me, almost as much as eating things like tripe and chicken feet.  I wanted to trust this girl and I did, completely, but I was just not quite ready and it frustrated her.  \n\nThen one day she put on No Reservations.  To say I was hooked was an understatement.  Tony was everything, and I mean EVERYTHING I wished I could be but had absolutely no idea HOW to be.  The guy was just so cool, no bullshit, absolutely FEARLESS, charisma for days and just the smoothest guy on the planet and more.  Normally, anyone with this long list of qualities would just be another celebrity, part man, part myth, fact and fiction in equal measure and no way to tell what's true.\n\nBut that wasn't Tony.  Oh sure, he was mythical, he told stories, you could never be sure what you were hearing was real because of just how outrageous it is.  Seriously, how was this guy still alive!  And yet, he was so, almost breathtakingly human.  He insisted on speaking about his addiction which was shocking when I first found out, but made me feel that much better about even just HAVING flaws.  He would have no issue with letting the camera see how miserable he was when things would go horribly wrong (and boy did they over the years of this and his other shows).  He at times would get outrageously drunk, make mistakes, piss people off, and, while his friends were LEGION, some enemies were inevitably made along the way.  \n\nAs my appreciation for him grew, episode by often binge watched episode, so too did a sense of the world I could not quite put my finger on.  My wife could see it too.  I began to ask questions.  I started to try those weird foods.  I started to *like* those weird foods because if Tony could not only do it but *LOVE* it, why couldn't I?  \n\nThen, just like that, I was on a plane to Europe.  I was speaking broken Italian and the waiters were loving it.  I was ordering things with no concept of what they were, only that they were recommended (and probably, but not always, amazing).  I was eating parts of animals I never even knew you could eat.  I was never, NEVER ordering my steak anything but medium rare.  I was not only eating mussels, I was heeding Tony's advice to ONLY eat them at a place you could trust (otherwise they marinate in their own piss).  I was eating street meat whenever I could.  France?  Yep, ate the snails.  Hong Kong?  Couldn't even tell you the names of these things but holy wow was it good.  Thailand in an open air taxi, love of my life at my side, breathing deep and always, always thinking of the episode I watched where Tony did this too.  The thrill we would get any time we would go anywhere he did was palpable.  He led the way.\n\nNow before I go any further, absolutely none of this could have happened if I had not met my absolutely stunning, beautiful, fearless and extremely competent wife.  She re-made me as a man of the world and as a result, opened my eyes and allowed me to become who I always wanted to be.  I love her for it and a billion other things and I know I will always fall woefully short in showing her just how much.  I also love her for putting that first episode on and watching every episode of everything Tony was ever even so much as guest starring in.  \n\nThat being said, I am not sure she ever would have gotten me out the door without Tony showing me the way first.  For all I know, maybe my now wife would have gotten so frustrated with me that my life could be so, awfully different (and without her in it).  We will ,thankfully, never know.  What I do know is that she brought me to him and he showed me that the world was not to be feared, but embraced, celebrated and experienced.  Not on computer screens or tv screens or books or stories (although these are certainly great ways to prepare!) but IN.  PERSON.  \n\nI am going to be having my first child any week now.  Travel, at least for a while, is absolutely grounded.   Also my heart breaks for his daughter.  I have no idea what their relationship was, but I hope she will be ok.  Knowing that she has Bourdain blood in her veins, she will, I believe, find a way, although I would be remiss to pass on a moment to acknowledge genetics and it's role in mental health issues.  For my own child, I will almost certainly be loading up these old episodes on Netflix, probably way before its appropriate.  I love everything about my parents, my upbringing and my time before the world opened up to me.  It was great.  I also do not want my boy to miss out on getting to know Anthony Bourdain the way that I did, as early as possible, so that his world can not only be made bigger, but far easy to go explore.  As soon as possible.  And for that, I will always be endlessly thankful to you Anthony, wherever you are, for everything you have done for me, even if I never sat down like this to really appreciate it.  \n\nI certainly wont invoke religion, another thing neither of us had much time for, but if I had to guess, you are in a relatively meager one room house in some version of Vietnam with a perfectly functional kitchen, sitting, watching the sun go down and enjoying a fantastically cold beer and some meat.  Doesn't even matter what the meat is, only that you are where you want to be, eating and drinking what you want.  You taught me that. \n \n\nThank you.\n\n-R"}, {"comment_id": "e0bog6m", "post_id": "8pj759", "comment": "I think we need to take a hard look in the medicine cabinet.

It became a whole sport thing where every body would come to my bed and see whose moth fell the furthest.\n\nThere was only 1 rule, only equipent you can use is Goosebumps. The sport was called, Mothbumps.  Hahahhahahhahahha.\n\nEdit: Really wanted to mention this one part. It got really difficult to borrow Goosebumps from the school library. The library was always out for some reason.

Otherwise the alternative, & continually helping others, will be to our detriment.   \n\nAnd this has nothing to do with race. Culture is the problem here & is a factual factor. Much like motorbike riders are a factual statistic making up a higher ratio of deaths of road users, some cultures, backgrounds & diversities bring along too much of their culture, refuse to assimilate to the way of life here, bring too much of their way of life & their problems with them.\n\nThe solution: don't shift the problem, address the issue at its epicentre. If people are leaving their country for fear of persecution, then ideally it needs to be dealt with & stopped where it's happening. By not having it dealt with there, these issues will eventually find themselves wherever the people (& hence culture) are allowed to travel, move & relocate to.

On the other hand, jingles and surround-screen shows starring (if you could call it that) \"The bunch\" don't really demand much of their audience. \n\n(Here's where I get the omg-that-feels-familiar vibe, personally. If you can't mentally cast \"the bunch\" from reality show people and network talking-head scrums, I feel you're not paying attention.) \n\nBradbury might boil all this down to \"people just watch too much TV\", but I think if you ask \"why?\" about them watching too much television (like, why do they do that, and why would they then want to burn the books instead of simply ignoring them?) you come to some interesting ideas that he actually touched on.

(You can go pretty deep with the photography analogy here if you wanted to).\n\n\n Even reading a novel with the goal of finding the author's intent is applying another lens.

The people want the books burned to keep from having to understand anything outside the mindless media being pumped into their boxes (you see that with his wife).\n2. The people who know what can be found in books want to keep that knowledge from coming to the masses to help keep the system in a status quo (the boss at the fire house).\n3. Books and knowledge can bring you unfound treasures that are little gems that the \"savage\" or average person would never uncover because they are lazy.\n4.

Wherever else the terror had happened, we, at least, had not been visited by Orwellian nightmares.\nBut we had forgotten that alongside Orwell's dark vision, there was another - slightly older, slightly less well known, equally chilling: Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. Contrary to common belief even among the educated, Huxley and Orwell did not prophesy the same thing. Orwell warns that we will be overcome by an externally imposed oppression.

It is a for-profit test whose scores are ever used for their school records. I could not find any reason that the tests are necessary.  I was never informed of this and never informed that it was voluntary testing. I only found out through researching because of frustration of the wasted two weeks that not only took away from their classes but caused my children extreme stress.  The questions were based on common core which were never taught to my children and resulted in a diminished confidence in how well they were doing in school. \n\nHere is an expert from one teacher.\n\n> I take objection to the fact that our children are being used as guinea pigs in an experiment to implement standards which were never field tested, are copyrighted, were not created using a democratic process, and were not created with the serious input of classroom teachers. Furthermore, the Common Core standards have placed unrealistic expectations on our youngest learners, many who now view themselves as failures because they are unable to meet the developmentally inappropriate expectations set by the Common Core standards.\n\n>I also refuse to administer the PARCC because I believe that participation in such testing gives the test credibility \u2013 of which it has none. The PARCC test was designed to assess the Common Core standards, which are not grounded in research, nor are they internationally benchmarked. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the Common Core standards, Common Core curriculum and Common Core testing, will in any way close the achievement gap. It will do the opposite. By funneling all of our tax dollars to corporations for curriculum, tests and technology to implement the test, we have ignored the elephant standing in the middle of the room \u2013 the number of homeless school children in Colorado, which has more than tripled in the last decade.  The poverty rate of black children stands at approximately 40 percent while the poverty rate of  Latino children is approximately 30 percent.\n\n>Colorado also has the third fastest growing rate of childhood poverty in the nation. We know quite clearly that children who have quality nutrition, healthcare, as well as access to books via libraries with certified librarians, and all the other resources provided to children in particular zip codes, actually, have done quite well on standardized tests in the past. Yet, we continue to ignore this fact, and we continue to feed our children living in poverty only tests. In order to pay for these tests, technology, and curriculum, we strip our schools of much needed resources such as books, small class size, librarians, nurses, counselors and more. Closing the achievement gap requires closing the resource gap.\n\n>As we consider closing the achievement gap, it\u2019s important to recognize that New York has administered Common Core tests two years in a row, both years resulting in approximately a 70 percent failure rate state-wide. Our achievement gap is increasing. And we continue to funnel our money away from the schools and directly into the pockets of profiteers.\n\nLast year I called their guidance counselor and told her my children were opting out of PARCC testing.  I also explained to my children they were not failures because of the testing and the monetary motive behind it.   \n\nThankfully my children understood but still felt awkward being one of the five students that were separated from their class and given school work to complete that also had no effect on their grades (but at least it was related to their current classes).\n\nThey are lucky enough to have wonderful teachers and both my children's time and their teachers time is one of many maddening examples of how precious days of schooling are wasted for profit.

Now, here's the thing about Blindsight, I finished the book hating it, it was one of those things that felt almost offensive to some of my dearly held beliefs, I thought about it for a long time, read it again and fell in love, I can't think of any other book which actually flipped my viewpoint.  \nOh, and \"Story of your Life\", on which Arrival is based, is much better than the movie... well, maybe they're just different animals for different niches. Story of you Life appears in the compilation Stories of your Life and Others, and all the others are also very good. Ted Chiang has a knack for taking some odd or even supernatural concept, and refining it into scientific law and then building great stories from that.

Much easier to come up with a list of fave authors because they generally have multiple books that you love. I'm glad to see you have the original 3 grandmasters of SF on your list. The thing about SF is one's taste changes over time. Since I'm literally a child of the space age (Sputnik was launched on the day I turned 2 months old) my science fiction tastes were what was on TV. Mostly cartoons, and as far from science as you could imagine. When I was 10, I started reading a smattering of SF with other genres, mostly young adults like Henry Higgens. Interesting thing I was able to find some SF, although it was written for young adults. More often than not, it was more whimsical,like the [Miss Pickerell series](https://www.fantasticfiction.com/m/ellen-macgregor/miss-pickerell-goes-to-mars.htm) that included not only just down to earth general science, but one book sent her to Mars. (eat your heart out Elon Musk)  As I approached puberty, SF books written for my age group seemed to have the common theme,\"Let's build a spaceship. Puberty came along and I discovered Robert Heinlein and harder sci-fi. By the time middle age hit, I started going after lighter novels, like those of Robert Asprin and Spider Robinson.  \n\nI don't read books as much as I used to, but I still read SF. The change has actually sent me back to enjoying SF and fantasy similar to what I watched as a child: Most of it's in the form of Manga or Anime.\n\nYou've got a good list there, and while it has an author whose works I can't stand on it, he IS a VERY popular author, so, as you like him, and I don't, I'll just say it's strictly a matter of taste.

Thanks for including footfall, it's a great invasion novel that I'd love to see made into a mini series, even if people would laugh their asses off at the baby elephants.  That it was included above Lucifer's hammer is surprising as generally that's the N&P book that most people rave about and a pleasant surprise at that.

There are plenty of \"feminists\" out there that have misconstrued the idea that \"You believe a rape victim by default\" to \"You punish someone who is accused of rape\".  These are two very separate issues.\n\nThere is also the reasonably common outcome for an accused rapist that they are fired before an enquiry.  We saw it with Weinstein, Spacey and Louis CK.  They are all been pushed out of organisations or contracts because of the accusation against them, not because an inquiry returned fruits.  Do not think for a second that they were expelled because of an attempt to punish them.

It's just a shame that persuasive writing is required."}, {"comment_id": "dsq6w7x", "post_id": "7qjzhc", "comment": "How...how do you have your head so far up your ass to claim that Margaret freaking Atwood isn't a feminist?"}, {"comment_id": "dsq2y03", "post_id": "7qjzhc", "comment": "Margaret Atwood comes from the Canadian school of thought and from a form of feminism that modern feminists wouldn't even see as being feminist.\n\nCanadians come from the British legal tradition and the British legal tradition was set by William Blackstone.  Blackstone decreed that he would sooner set 10 guilty men free than imprison one innocent man.  That is, the evidence has to be strong.\n\nIt is why the conviction rate in Canada for all crimes is exceptionally low.  Everyone is always complaining about our prisons being full of marijuana users (which is false) by actually only 1 in 100 that go to trial will ever receive a criminal charge.\n\nSexual assault is perhaps worse because activists will use the unreported statistics instead of the reported.  Like, if we used the unreported marijuana statistics it would inflate statistics too.  Sexual assault represents 1% of all reported crimes in Canada at 60,000 cases.  Of those 60,000 cases 50% are charged.  20% (so 40% of those charged) will go to a trial... and FINALLY 1 In 10 are convicted.\n\n10% conviction rate at trial fits perfectly into what Blackwood's ratio had in mind.  Drug related offences have a 1% conviction rate.\n\nIf you are a modern feminist one not guilty plea is too many.  When you convince yourself that someone has to be guilty there is no option for them to ever be innocent.\n\nIn a high profile Canadian case Q Host Jian Ghomeshi (a former friend of Margaret Atwood) was charged by three women.  People were early on stating that Ghomeshi would never be convicted because he has such a large cult following in Canada.  Ghomeshi was very respected and well known in Canada nationally for his radio program.  When three people came out against him it seemed like he was doomed, punching, slamming into walls, forceful aggression, and nasty language.\n\nBut Ghomeshi had one rival on his side, a rigged legal system.  Ghomeshi wasn't just abusive, he was sexually aroused by abuse.  He pursued BDSM relationships with people in a consensual manner.  Each partner had signed written agreements on what would happen, what sort of sex it would be, and safety words in case it got so extreme.  He recorded every single phone call.  He saved every single text.  Every single letter.  He had binders of evidence.  Most importantly one of the defendants (a female actor from Trailer Park Boys) was caught colluding with other witnesses and coaching them to tailor their testimonies to exclude information and facts.  When it was all said and done with the 'rigged system' on his side he was successful in convincing the courts that because he had signed contracts, text messages showing a continuing casual relationship, and actual phone calls in which these women asked for more... he was successful in showing this was not rape.\n\nHowever.... the court of public opinion still says he is guilty and his level of documentation and evidence is only evidence of how much of a sick rapist he is.\n\nMargaret Atwood has been tarred and feathered since she showed any level of support for Ghomeshi.  Perhaps.... from all those birds she wants to save by not letting your cat out."}, {"comment_id": "dspvxj7", "post_id": "7qjzhc", "comment": "Atwood is absolutely correct.

We need to shut down social media.\n\nI'm just so sick of the constant omnidirectional outrage. On the right there are trumpling stooges, brainwashed by propaganda, who attack anyone and anything that dares question the cult of personality surrounding their God Emperor. I knew about these people (and they are terrifying) but what has frustrated me the most are the people on the left. I thought we were smarter than that, more capable of nuance and respectful conversation, but social media gives those who are too dumb and too shrill to survive a real-world conversation a chance to amplify their views to the world. Whatever the topic area--sexual harassment, civil rights, healthcare--it's the loudest, most extreme voices that dictate the conversation. They are fundamentalists obsessed with enforcing their own unrealistic standards of purity on everyone else, and anyone who doesn't share those views (even if they agree on 95% of other issues) is attacked as an enemy that must be annihilated. \n\nMargaret Atwood is a great writer, a great person, and a feminist hero. It sickens me that anyone could interpret what she's writing about, an appeal to rational thinking and due process, as a hatred of women. But that's what happens all the time on social media. I've had online commenters tell me I'm a \"threat to women\" and \"complicit in rape culture\" just because I said something similar to what Atwood did (although nowhere near as well-written), and that if I don't spend every waking minute of my day making sure I am not offending or making people uncomfortable that I am just as bad as someone who slips a roofie in a drink or grabs a breast. \n\nHow on earth are we supposed to move forward, and make the positive changes to protect women that most of us want, with these ideological fanatics holding us hostage? How are we supposed to accommodate all of the extreme, non-negotiable views that each one of these different people holds?  \n\nI've realized that humans just aren't designed to interact with each other without cues like body language or vocal inflection to help us. On the internet all nuance is lost and as a result everything is interpreted in its most extreme, hyperbolic form. \n\nLast week I went to a happy hour with some women from my office. I was the only guy there, at a table with a bunch of professional, independent, proudly-feminist women. And of course all of this harassment stuff came up, but I was shocked to realize that, out here in the real world, I was able to ask these women questions and have a respectful conversation where it turned out we all mostly agreed and any differences were understood and respected. Nobody screamed or called anyone monster the way it would be if any of us posted our exact same thoughts online. It just reinforced to me that there is a major difference between real problems and what the outrage-industrial complex believes are problems, and that for my own sanity I need to stay away from it all.

I went around and about half way there were 4 woman standing in the way. I asked them if they could please move out of the way. One moved about half a step forwards.

There were writerly readerships before but they were educated. I don't mean to say that reading is only (or should only be) the domain or someone who can read multiple classical or romance languages, or anything like that.

People read for different purposes and no one can force you to finish reading a book that you aren't enjoying, you can read purely for entertainment and pleasure if that's what you want to do.\n\nBut this idea is so pervasive now that people have to make excuses for why, say, Moby Dick is \"boring\", as though the process of reading must be pleasurable and entertaining first before any other considerations of content or meaning, there's a cultural problem with the reading world."}, {"comment_id": "ei45d6h", "post_id": "ayrfyg", "comment": "As a middle school reading teacher of super reluctant readers, I planned a novel study that I was certain the kids wouldn't get into.

No, they define:\n\n>**tsundoku** (*noun*) buying books and not reading them; letting books pile up unread on shelves or floors and nightstands\n\nWhat's the problem? They're defining the word to be a noun with a verbal definition!\n\nAlso, if we want the concept in English, may I propose the term *booklog*, it's a fun play on the term *backlog* (\"an accumulation of something, especially uncompleted work or matters that need to be dealt with\"), which I hope is obvious, and gives us a clever way of handling nominal and verbal roles:\n\n* \"I really want to pick this up, but I have such a huge booklog.\"\n* \"I'd get this for grampa's birthday, but he's so booklogged I'm not sure he'd ever get to it.\"\n* \"Well, here's another title for the booklog.\"\n\nI know we love to cannibalize words from other languages, and I know that sometimes other languages have awesome words that express things our language lacks.

I regret that I am not clear as to what you intend by arisch. I am not of Aryan extraction: that is Indo-Iranian; as far as I am aware none of my ancestors spoke Hindustani, Persian, Gypsy, or any related dialects. But if I am to understand that you are enquiring whether I am of Jewish origin, I can only reply that I regret that I appear to have no ancestors of that gifted people. My great-great-grandfather came to England in the eighteenth century from Germany: the main part of my descent is therefore purely English, and I am an English subject \u2014 which should be sufficient. I have been accustomed, nonetheless, to regard my German name with pride, and continued to do so throughout the period of the late regrettable war, in which I served in the English army. I cannot, however, forbear to comment that if impertinent and irrelevant inquiries of this sort are to become the rule in matters of literature, then the time is not far distant when a German name will no longer be a source of pride.\n\nYour enquiry is doubtless made in order to comply with the laws of your own country, but that this should be held to apply to the subjects of another state would be improper, even if it had (as it has not) any bearing whatsoever on the merits of my work or its sustainability for publication, of which you appear to have satisfied yourselves without reference to my Abstammung.\n\nI trust you will find this reply satisfactory, and \n\nremain yours faithfully,\n\nJ.

Even if they were, the most athletic cows can only jump two meters high. The boy didn\u2019t know that either though.\n\nEverything the boy had ever been taught was a lie. Everything his senses could tell him was a lie or would soon be rendered untrue.\n\nAnd there were three little bears sitting on chairs\n\nAnd two little kittens\n\nAnd a pair of mittens\n\nAnd a little toy house\n\nAnd a young mouse.\n\nThe bears, the kittens, the house and the mouse were all fake. Each was nothing more than a paltry copy of what actually existed in the world. None of them would ever have life. The boy knew this. Sometimes he ascribed life to the objects. It made him feel better. That type of life was life that he had complete control over. In a world of his own devising everything could go as he planned, and everything would be good for all. The boy wondered why he did not live in such a world. The boy wondered what separated him from the objects of his play. Perhaps he too were only the plaything of some, higher being. When the being was bored with him, was when he slept.\n\nThere was a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush\n\nThe boy cried out- for now he understood his own consciousness, and the very false nature of himself.\n\nA quiet old lady whispered \u201chush\u201d\n\nBut she did not know. How could anyone else know? How could anyone else care? When the boy went to sleep, that was the end of his own consciousness. For eight hours, he would be dead. When the shell that he now inhabited returned to wakefulness, who would really be the mind in the shell. The boy knew that to sleep was to invite the death of his own mind.\n\nHe fought fatigue, but his body was still young, and it betrayed him. He began to slip slowly into the clutches of sleep- into the clutches of death. Tonight, when he said goodnight, he knew that he said goodbye.\n\nGoodnight room.\n\nHe felt a strange separation, knowing that of course the room would never know that he had died. The next day a boy exactly like him would wake up in his bed and play just as he did.\n\nGoodnight moon.\n\nThe moon was beautiful. The boy did not know why he thought so. He had never been to the moon, and no one he knew had ever been to the moon. Perhaps the moon was simply something his mind had created to distract him from the coming demise.\n\nGoodnight cow jumping over the moon.\n\nThe boy knew. The picture was not real. If the moon was not real, how could a cow jump over it? But yet, when he saw it, the boy giggled. Perhaps absurdity and beauty truly were the only escapes from this dread that he felt.\n\nGoodnight light\n\nAnd the red balloon\n\nGoodnight bears\n\nGoodnight chairs\n\nGoodnight kittens\n\nAnd goodnight mittens\n\nThe boy wanted to feel something as he said goodbye to all of his favorite things for the last time. But he felt nothing except for a sense of how ludicrous everything was. He almost laughed out loud thinking that only earlier today he imagined that his life might have had some meaning. Yet, how could his life have meaning when it was so brief. He had only just become aware of what his life truly meant an hour ago and now it would all be over.\n\nGoodnight clocks\n\nAnd goodnight socks\n\nGoodnight little house\n\nAnd goodnight mouse\n\nGoodnight comb\n\nAnd goodnight brush\n\n\u201cGoodnight nobody\u201d the boy whispered into the air. He did not know whom he was talking to. Perhaps he was talking to himself, realizing that his time on this planet was as short as a single day. Perhaps he was talking to the boy who would live in his place tomorrow. Perhaps he was talking to all of the hundreds that had come before him.\n\nGoodnight mush\n\nAnd goodnight to the old lady whispering \u201chush\u201d\n\nShe was no longer there with him, and the boy knew that he had said goodnight to her for the first and the last time. She was no more unchanging than he, and tonight, she too would cease to exist.\n\nGoodnight stars\n\nHe thought how sad it was that he would never see their beauty again. He wondered if even the stars died.\n\nGoodnight air\n\nThe world was now quiet. Everyone was going to sleep, marching docilely to their deaths. The boy began to cry, for he could hold out no longer. His eyes began to close in spite of himself, and he felt himself begin to slip away.\n\nGood night noises everywhere."}, {"comment_id": "dmier0p", "post_id": "6xtorf", "comment": "I received this book as a gift when I was a baby and had the pleasure of passing on the tradition to my neice just a few months ago. \n\nIts hard to read without getting emotional."}, {"comment_id": "dmij7yi", "post_id": "6xtorf", "comment": "Due to read it for the 10,000th time in 18 minutes"}, {"comment_id": "dmifxup", "post_id": "6xtorf", "comment": "My 3 year old doesn't like this book.

Many of my friends are part of the LGBT+ community, including my fianc\u00e9. \n\nSo to find a book where the main characters have no gender, love each other (in whatever way) regardless of societal norms, and present in feminine clothes without it being a joke, was a big deal for me and many others. One of my friends was very appreciative of Aziraphale's canonical chubbiness (and the bodyshaming in the show appearing as a rude thing to say.) Not to mention, you published it in 1990, before gay marriage was legalized and the Trans Rights movement picked up steam. Even if you didn't intend it to be such a big, positive thing to include, it is to us. So, thank you very much.\n\nI suppose my question would be: Did you and Sir Terry ever entertain the idea of a Good Omens sequel?

That can fuck with you, because you realize that you yourself don't have the power to know for a fact if anything is a real in your own life.

It took a long time for me to teach her why we had to adopt an orphaned dog, not buy a puppy to assuage selfish desires of extreme cuteness. She still may grow up to be the type to buy a puppy and otherwise make selfish decisions that contribute to pollution, global poverty/exploitation etc. I wish for her sake and that of our world that her dad had been more like all of you and realized children really don't need protection from awareness of the suffering of animals and elderly in our community.

You will leave the relationship feeling like you were the problem. \n\nFor people who are not very strong or secure with themselves I DO NOT recommend getting into a romantic relationship with a BPD person who is not actively in therapy. The worst part is often times a person will not tell you they have mental conditions so you end up devoting months to a relationship and then one day they confess they have severe issues internally."}, {"comment_id": "dpcgka6", "post_id": "7aqh50", "comment": "Hello.

I myself have borderline and was diagnosed 2 or 3 years ago and I met my future wife in a hospital last year and she also has BPD.  It feels like the hardest thing in the world.  Since its an invisible illness people think you should just be fine and just be happy.  \"Get over it\"  has got to be the worst thing you can do for people like us.\n\nI'm so happy to hear you are looking forward to the future.. I know what you mean by \"finally looking forward\".\n\nSo my point is I empathize drastically with you and I am happy to hear a follow borderline person is happy and looking toward the future!  Hell of a job.\n\nI'm sure you've heard of DBT and CBT and I'm also quite sure you've been through those groups also.  For anyone else with it or know anyone with it.  DO DBT!!  It's a massive life changer.\n\nPSA:  If someone you know and love/care about.  Just show them you're trying the best you can to understand and support them.  This is 100% the best thing you can do.  Validate them and try.  When I found out my sister was reading a book about it I broke down and cried right away.  When I told my aunt about Borderline she said \"sounds like everyone has it, not a big deal\"  And that caused a lot of damage and now I never go back to her about my struggles.\n\nLonger comment than anticipated but the stigma around Borderline is doing so much damage.  Spread as much information about it as you can to beat the stigma.  The stigma is doing just as much damage as having borderline, if not more.\n\nThere are others out there and we understand and we care.  Stay strong and try your best and it WILL get better.  I've been down a horrible road the last 5 years and it has gotten better through counselling, DBT and CBT.  If you're scared to do group counselling... I promise it's so rewarding to be around people who actually understand and think JUST LIKE YOU.

I have literal goosebumps and tears in my eyes right now over this. This is hope. I'm an artist myself and consider writing to be an art form unto itself. \n\nI am buying your book. No second thoughts. Being a guy with BPD is so hard in today's society where you're expected to be 'a man' when sometimes you wanna cry at the beauty of a moment, a sunset, a shooting star, at the end of a movie during the whole inspiration bit, aswell as wanting to just shut down to the world, have no one bother you so you can just sit feeling the existential gloom set in. \n\nI've also wanted to write a book on my experiences with BPD, but wouldn't know really where to start, especially alongside trying to sell myself as an artist. \n\nI'm so excited about this, I wish you all the best man. \n\nAs an extension to this I recently lost one of my closest friends because of her BPD, everyone keeps telling me it's an accidental overdose, but I know it was suicide. She tried a few times earlier this year, she would come to my house at 1-3 in the morning because she couldn't sleep and we'd sit up watching movies until the morning where she'd go home and sleep. We'd sit beneath the stars listening to Jeff Wayne's war of the worlds on a hilltop out in the sticks...this girl turned to me in her darkest moments and we'd sit and cry together just being able to be ourselves, there was nothing sexual between us just unconditional love. I saw how everybody would treat her with her BPD and she found it so easy being around us all, but when it comes to guys with BPD it's a different matter, I saw people are less willing to understand the social faux pas, the awkward silences where we don't know what to say, or that we fall in love too easily, and hate too readily...I don't know where I'm going with this, just venting to an understanding crowd...\n\nHer death was a reminder of where I was and why I chose to never attempt suicide or self harm again. I used to drink everyday aswell. It's been years since I have been down that path and I never give myself enough credit for climbing that mountain, to stop self harming, to stop drinking alcohol, to be what I always wanted to be. I'm at this next hurdle of trying to make money through my creations aswell. I'm currently exhibiting work in London and meeting a potential collective tonight, yet I am terrified of meeting them. New people, new situations, on my own.....\n\nSorry for the long off topic rant, I've just never really been in a place with other male borderlines and it's just pushed a button y'know?

You think because he doesn\u2019t want you anymore that he is right \u2013 that his judgment and opinion of you are correct. If he throws you out, then you are garbage.

Did you ever see the way the clouds love a mountain? They circle all around it; sometimes you can\u2019t even see the mountain for the clouds. But you know what? You go up top and what do you see? His head. The clouds never cover the head. His head pokes through, because the clouds let him; they don\u2019t wrap him up. They let him keep his head up high, free, with nothing to hide him or bind him. [...] You can\u2019t own a human being. You can\u2019t lose what you don\u2019t own. Suppose you did own him. Could you really love somebody who was absolutely nobody without you? You really want somebody like that? Somebody who falls apart when you walk out the door? You don\u2019t, do you? And neither does he. You\u2019re turning over your whole life to him. Your whole life, girl. And if it means so little to you that you can just give it away, hand it to him, then why should it mean any more to him? He can\u2019t value you more than you value yourself.*    \n\nThat analogy with the clouds and the mountain is so clever and eloquent, and there's just something really beautiful about the way this passage is written in general.

Morrison was aware that a vast majority of popular, in addition to what is considered classic, books were written by white authors and centered on typically white \"traditions\". Not that there was anything wrong with that, because fantastic literature is just that, but she wanted to write books that fit into African-American culture and traditions, and that brought awareness to issues within the black community.\n\nMorrison went on to write a number of books, including *The Bluest Eye* (1970), *Sula* (1973), *Song of Solomon* (1977), *Beloved* (1987) and *Jazz* (1992). Throughout her life, she won a number of awards, such as the Pulitzer Prize in Fiction (1988 for *Beloved*), the Nobel Prize in Literature (1993) and the Presidential Medal of Freedom (2012).\n\nToni Morrison believed that books could perform wonders upon the wounds of injustice, and she used her writing to do just that, changing lives in the process.

One day as an aside from our normal class material she tells us that she received a letter from Harper Lee (please suspend your disbelief until the end). Not just a letter, but a second letter. Like most of you reading, there were a few skeptics in the class. It was an honors class. So about half of us were smart enough to know that Harper Lee was a recluse.\n\nHer excitement over getting the letter was of course too much and she had to share it with her class. Story goes that she sent a letter to Harper Lee asking about a character mentioned in To Kill a Mocking Bird, The Grey Ghost. Well my teacher got a response, much to her surprise, a month or so later. She knew writing a letter to Harper Lee was less likely to get a response than a letter to Santa Clause. However bringing up The Grey Ghost brought back a lot of memories to Mrs. Lee. The book was something that she had thought about often over the years, but she had never been able to find a copy due to its relative rarity.\n\nIt was 1997, the toddler years of the information age, so my teacher goes on the internet and finds a rare book dealer that has a first or second edition for 200 something dollars. So she mails the book to Harper Lee and Mrs Lee sends her back a second letter and a check for 100 dollars. Of course my teacher was never going to cash the check. The letter was very thankful, and well written. The Grey Ghost was a big part of Mrs Lee's childhood and brought back a lot of memories for her. \"You have made an old lady very happy,\" is how I believe she put it.\n\nIt always made me glad to think that she was able to get back a piece of her childhood in her later years.\n"}, {"comment_id": "d06le5a", "post_id": "46l48e", "comment": "Non-american here.

Only once have I regretted weeding anything. It was a nonfiction series about the Iroquois that was physically falling apart and I assumed it would be easily replaced. There was something (still not sure what) about that series that one of my teachers LOVED and I still get asked if I can get new copies. It\u2019s out of print and no one but this specific teacher seems to want this book, but I would buy it again just to get him off my back. It\u2019s been 3 years now.

Our Councils have been corrupt for years and have mismanaged our town and county, stripping the character out of this whole area. \n\nNorthamptonshire is a county of polarisation. In South Northamptonshire, some of the richest people in the UK live in massive sandstone mansions with beautiful countryside estates. In the towns (such as Corby and Northampton) homeless people lay in the streets, we have the lowest educational attainment in the country and in Corby there is some of the lowest life expectancy in the country - and probably in Western Europe too. As for the County town Northampton - nearly half of the town was built in the 60s as Council Estates, what Americans would call \"Projects\". But there is nothing to do in these areas, collectively known as the Eastern District. The centre of Northampton also has some deprived areas like Spring Boroughs, Kings Heath, the Mounts and Semilong. These areas also have nothing to do, so on a saturday night you get thousands of people pouring into a tiny town centre and drinking [huge amounts of alcohol](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/10825449/Britains-binge-drinking-levels-are-among-the-highest-in-the-world.html) - seriously, the UK prevalence of \"Heavy Episodic Drinking\" is 28% - compared to Germany at 12.5% and the US at 16.9%. There are always a huge number of fights, and our town centre has one of the top 5 dangerous roads in the UK in it because of this. \n\nThe town has 230,000 people, but its a backwater, and people feel like they are living in a decaying, depressing place. The town sits in the Nene Valley, which means that for like 90% of the year the town is covered in low lying grey clouds known by locals as \"The Soup\" - although its been really sunny recently, usually its pretty rare to get a glimpse of the sun most days. In terms of history, Northampton used to be a seat of Royal power, and had a radical university in the 1200s that rivalled Oxford. However, our university was shut down and we were banned from having one for over 700 years until the early 2000s by LAW! And our massive castle was smashed to pieces by the Royals after we sided with Parliament in the Civil War - a historical factor which is felt keenly by some (very few nowadays) of the older people here, who have an ancestral dislike of the Royal family. We did have the first Atheist MP though, which is pretty cool. \n\nJust some of the awful things going on here:\n\n* Our council is bankrupt, and cannot even afford to power all of the street lights. So half the town is in darkness at night, and crime is on the up. A few years ago 30-50 people  rioted and attacked eachother in the Town centre with machetes and knives as part\nof gang violence.\n* Our local museum sold its one well known item to a private collector, and has been downgraded, and will therefore receive less funding. \n\n* Millions of pounds were given to our local football club by the council as a loan. This money then mysteriously \"disappeared\". \n\n* The council sold off our historical cobbled stones in the Market centre - so that another town could buy them and have a pretty market square instead!\n\n* The Councils are reorganising themselves to save money. However, in the process many small wards will be destroyed. This means that whereas before, a tiny party like the Greens, or a local independent could try and get represented in the council, now only the two big parties, Labour and the Conservatives, will have a chance of getting on the council.\n\n* Hundreds of historical buildings have been knocked down over the last 40 years - some of them priceless in terms of aesthetic beauty. Many of those that remain are large factories - long since shut down and boarded up. However, they are owned by rich owners who want to redevelop the land. So they are letting the listed buildings (which cannot be knocked down by law) crumble and moulder away until they either become a threat to public safety and have to be torn down, or they \"accidentally burn down in the night\".\n\n\nI don't live in Northampton anymore, as I moved for Uni down south to a beautiful town that is looked after by its council. The difference is stark. Northampton is a dying town - a black hole that people cannot escape from. The increase in deprivation in the last few years is crazy, and Northampton feels like its only a few events away from a breakdown of public order at times.

"}, {"comment_id": "dpymgh7", "post_id": "7dkdyo", "comment": "I see a lot of people either comparing the Condor Heroes arc to LOTR, or people (who seem not to have actually read Jin Yong) protesting the comparison.\n\nAs someone who's read most of Jin Yong's AND Tolkien's work, upon thought the two are actually somewhat similar- although I might prefer to compare JY to GRRM (even though their treatment of the \"good guys\" tends to be rather different, ha- edit: actually, not all of his novels have \"happy\" or \"definite\" endings- my favourite one sort of doesn't, actually).\n\n1 key theme I'll discuss (as it's late where I am, am happy to discuss more after some sleep)- these authors' blending of real world and fictional elements. \n\nLOTR obviously had a lot of fantasy elements, but it also had characters struggling to grow into their destiny (Aragorn), men overcoming their weaknesses (Boromir, Faramir) and the themes of love and family (and not just the romantic type of love). In general many great novels contain some sort of bildungsroman, since growth is part of the human experience. \n\nJY's works might sound to Western audiences like pulpy action novels, but they are anything but. Most criticism seems to centre on LOTR being well-researched and hugely influential on Western fantasy (and what seems to be an assumption that the Condor arc isn't?).\n\nI assure you, JY's works are in \"historical\" China and while they are not 100% historically accurate (given the nature of wuxia that is a bit impossible) they are very well-researched for their genre- this is part of JY's popularity, similar to The Song of Ice and Fire in that sense. Obviously a lot of elements are \"fantastic\" in nature, like some of the more superhuman feats (off the top of my head, maybe Yang Guo's training in a riptide/undercurrent). But these are all based on Chinese concepts of yin/yang, chi pressure points, anatomy, martial arts etc., and many of his characters have historical roots or counterparts. \n\nI think both novels examine their cultural norms in some way, whether it's the Western ideal of \"manliness\" (Tolkien does not explicitly say this but the Boromir-Aragorn initial tension, Faramir's issues with Denethor, etc. all point to this) or the Chinese focus on patriotism and/or family bonds- my favourite JY character, Xiao Feng who is a main character in Demi Gods Demi Devils (SUCH a great book) is a great analysis on personal identity, nationalism, etc. \n\nBoth novels are also well-written- some criticism is levied at LOTR's verbosity, which I think is a bit unfair. To me, his descriptions of the landscapes are great- this is a bit like people who hate pastoral poetry bitching about Keats IMO. With JY, he was leagues ahead of the average newspaper stand pulp that was sold, and helped set a new standard for the wuxia genre. His use of idioms is pretty spot on and his action scenes are amazing, and here I'm going to go on a tangent on Chinese vocab: a literal translation for a Chinese idiom would be 4-word-phrases or set phrases, and these are basically condensed phrases that unpack to have a sentence or more of meaning, and sometimes have roots in Chinese history. Just found a site called interestingchinese.com that seems to be quite accurate and has a few sayings down. In general, being able to adeptly use and adapt a wide variety of idioms tends to show the writer has a thorough knowledge of Chinese history, culture and literature.  \n\nI'm also going to point out that he has MANY strong female characters, even though some of them may not seem to be according to Western values/standards. \n\nI'm not entirely sure how this translation will do, but I truly hope it succeeds to showing a new facet of Chinese culture (both historical and modern) to new readers. :)\n\nEdit: going back and doing some editing and expanding since I was writing this while super tired at 4am. :)"}, {"comment_id": "dpykgka", "post_id": "7dkdyo", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dpyhu74", "post_id": "7dkdyo", "comment": "What is it about?"}, {"comment_id": "dpyjfyk", "post_id": "7dkdyo", "comment": "Fun fact about Jin Yong\uff1a\nJin Yong has wrote 15 novels and the first character of all his novels can be combined into a chinese couplet\uff1a\u201c\u98de\u96ea\u8fde\u5929\u5c04\u767d\u9e7f,\u7b11\u4e66\u795e\u4fa0\u501a\u78a7\u9e33\u201d which roughly translates to \"Hunting White Stag in a Snowy Winter, Smiling Wanderer/Warrior Riding a Royal Bird\" \n\n\u98de\u72d0\u5916\u4f20 [The Young Flying Fox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Young_Flying_Fox)\n\n\u96ea\u5c71\u98de\u5b64 [Flying Fox of Snowy Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fox_Volant_of_the_Snowy_Mountain)\n\n\u8fde\u57ce\u51b3 [Secret of the Linked Cities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Deadly_Secret)\n\n\u5929\u9f99\u516b\u90e8 [Demi-Gods and Semi-Devils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demi-Gods_and_Semi-Devils)\n\n\u5c04\u96d5\u82f1\u96c4\u4f20 [The Legend of the Condor Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_the_Condor_Heroes)\n\n\u767d\u9a6c\u5578\u897f\u98ce [White Horse Neighs in the Western Wind\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Horse_Neighs_in_the_Western_Wind)\n\n\u9e7f\u9f0e\u8bb0 [The Duke of Mount Deer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deer_and_the_Cauldron)\n\n\u7b11\u50b2\u6c5f\u6e56 [The Smiling, Proud Wanderer ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Smiling,_Proud_Wanderer)\n\n\u4e66\u5251\u6069\u4ec7\u5f55 [The Book and the Sword](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Book_and_the_Sword)\n\n\u795e\u96d5\u4fa0\u4fa3 [The Return of the Condor Heroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Condor_Heroes)\n\n\u4fa0\u5ba2\u884c [Ode to Gallantry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ode_to_Gallantry)\n\n\u501a\u5929\u5c60\u9f99\u8bb0 [The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Heaven_Sword_and_Dragon_Saber)\n\n\u78a7\u8840\u5251 [Sword Stained with Royal Blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sword_Stained_with_Royal_Blood)\n\nI think most of them have been remake into drama series and movies  throughout the 80s-90s by Hong Kong and China?

His stories build worlds. There\u2019s multiple plot lines running at the same time, each one as fascinating as the main one. The world history and lore he describes is so intricate and beautiful and strange and different in so many ways from western fantasy books I\u2019ve read. It\u2019s a blend of history and imagination so seamlessly stitched together that you can almost believe it really happened, making wish for a time machine so that you can be there to breath it all in. Every single one of the characters (protagonists, antagonists, fillers, sides) are multifaceted and layered. Villains have nuisances and idiosyncrasies that make them real and likable, protagonists are never trope characters that just swing a sword and win fair maiden. And you never (NEVER) foresee how the story is going to end. I\u2019ve never read anything quite like it and I don\u2019t think I will ever again.\n\nIt was always sad to me growing up that there was a huge world of readers out there that would never have a chance to read him.

Will definitely get a copy of it when it is released though.\n\n\nI guess calling it the LoTR of Chinese literature might not be too off, as they do share a similar 'power corrupts even the good' kinda trope. In his books, a common trope would be that the orthodox sects are the most unscrupulous in their quest for power, whereas those who are labelled as unorthodox (evil) by the powers that be (in this case, the orthodox) are, in fact, righteous people.\n\n\nThis could be loosely-interpreted as a social commentary of sorts, with the 'orthodox' being the government, and the 'unorthodox' being the people who were willing to stand up against them.

It results in poor collection management and poor cataloguing standards, which may not sound like much, but when a kid searches the OPAC and can\u2019t find something on a very general topic, or the resources are extremely outdated, they invariably won\u2019t use the library. I guess it\u2019s a vicious cycle, administrators don\u2019t see the importance of the library, place unqualified/underprepared staff in, circulation and library usage drops as a result. \n\nThe other issue I\u2019ve seen is that there are some qualified teacher librarians who operate libraries like it\u2019s still the 1990s.

Information content is now distributed among many websites, and is replicated across platforms.

It's an intimate connection between the reader and the mind of the author.     \n\nOnline we do not enjoy this same connection, typically.    Wikipedia, for example, is an autocratically curated information resource, which could easily be modified without our knowledge or consent.

It has taken quite a bit of work to train my followers to be positive over negative. But, when I was getting my following going I would intentionally start arguments to make my posts end up higher on Facebooks Algorithm and thus making my post more popular. Once it hits around 40 comments and 45 impressions, I delete the argument and the post is popular while being mostly positive. I like to say that Facebook promotes hostility over humility because of this design.\n\nNow Reddit is a microcosm of that idea, there are three stages of interaction within Reddit... \n\n1st... I hate this. downvote.\n\n2nd... I like this and accept its existence. no interaction, perhaps a comment.\n\n3rd... This is amazing, upvote, really amazing gilded\n\nYou are far more likely to get a negative interaction than a positive interaction and because of the diminishing returns on upvotes (or whatever it's actually called) something has to be overwhelmingly praised in order to get above water. \n\nBut any opinion that requires conflict or stands against popular opinion? Don't even bother if you care about Comment Karma. \n\nReddit has changed a lot over the years and being a place for free discussion that it once was isn't possible because of the combination of the design of the system and volume of those that are on the site. \n\nIn the end, the system was designed to speak to the community that was within it and here we are.\n\nThis is the community... so, if you really want to see a change, you would have to have some kinda campaign to change the community itself. For example, if the problem is that not enough people are upvoting then campaign for that, or if people are downvoting too much and not following redditque then campaign for that, just like an issue. I've actually seen these happen in the past. Also, you could build a subreddit in advance specifically for this goal so you could target these posts to make sure they make it passed the downvoters and basically go to war with these teams of people who are controlling who sees what posts. Trust me you will find them quickly.\n\nEventually, you would go through the mods and then, then maybe you could get the place that it really should be... \n\nSounds kinda fun really.\n"}, {"comment_id": "dl1hyk1", "post_id": "6qxh4l", "comment": "Absolutely agree!

Because really, you kind of have to force them if you want a shot at getting a high percentage of the students to read anything.

As we spent the semester researching, the librarian was an excellent resource for learning about new periodicals as well (she ordered all of them and had good domain knowledge). \n\nFast-forward to High School and things drastically shifted. The librarian gave us access to EBSCO and that was that. The advent of better search engines (e.g. Google) had already made everything we learned in 6th grade obsolete. \n\nThe article itself made it clear that most libraries did not shut down, but instead hired people who had minimal training. While that does not solve the problem of curating a good library collection, I have no doubt that schools could simply ensure they provide books on ALA lists and buy a few top sellers each year. \n\nIt saddens me to rule a whole profession obsolete (especially because my first librarian was so helpful), but I think this makes sense :/ "}, {"comment_id": "dzf3veq", "post_id": "8lekya", "comment": "And 100% of their mimeograph repair technicians since 1960."}, {"comment_id": "dzfdghn", "post_id": "8lekya", "comment": "I don\u2019t know if my high school librarians were different than other people\u2019s but mine were awful.

Killed his ex-wife with a baseball bat at their daughter's first birthday party.  \n  \nI use to be a barista in San Diego for years in the 90s and early 00s.  James was younger than me, a teenage cadet at a private army school. Nice enough kid and told us that he father and uncle were these famous pornographers: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitchell_brothers  \n  \nWell, Hunter S Thompson was friends with those guys, and after hearing this I had James (Jim 'Mad' Mitchell) get a book signed by him. Well, unbeknownst to me, they were actually really close, and the book was delivered to and returned from Hunter while he was in a minimum security jail for a drug charge in California.  \n \nhttps://imgur.com/tyrpUTz\n\nThe very last word is 'Rafey'... that is referring to James Raphael Mitchel, which was hunter's nickname for him.  \n  \n  \nEDIT: I'm aware of the discrepancies in the handwriting.  I will return to this thread with further handwriting evidence.  It very well may have been faked by that piece of shit James, but there ARE similarities to various writing samples and letters.  H.S.T. handwriting was all over the place and he was at the end of his life when this happened.\n\nEDIT2: So this (https://i.imgur.com/uuZABnh.png) is the closest example of H.S.T. writing (a rushed note to Ralph Steadman) that looks anything like the inscription I have.  I think there are still enough differences to cast serious doubt on the authenticity.  But, the fucked up provenance and person who actually did this is insane, esp. since he was only 16 at the time makes for something but I have no interest in contacting him to find out.... he's been somewhat harrassing a friend of mine from in prison.  One other thing I know about him is that at the same age thereabout he was kicked out of the army school (Army Navy Academy in Carlsbad CA) for secretly filming his fellow cadet have sex with a girl in their dorm room and then sharing it.
