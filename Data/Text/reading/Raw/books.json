There are shitty regulations that do prevent smaller ISPs from bringing competition to the infrastructure / ISP market. These are a mix of both federal and local regulations that have granted the big telcos virtual monopolies in various areas of the country.\nThat has nothing to do with Net Neutrality.\nNet Neutrality is simply the idea that an ISP cannot manipulate the data they are delivering through your connection. If you pay for X bandwidth, you can then access all of the internet at that bandwidth.\nRemoving Net Neutrality will do absolutely nothing to make the telco industry a \"free market\". It will only allow the big telcos to take full advantage of their monopolies.  It was only made \"political\" when politicians started lying about what it is and isn't, and convincing gullible people that the way the internet has worked since its inception wasn't in their interests.\"\n\nWell said DarraignTheSane."}, {"comment_id": "dq6be9r", "post_id": "7en6do", "comment": "Already texted my bot and tweeted to my reps.

My steadfast loyalty to the Republic party has been resolute due to my steadfast believe in a party platform of personal ethics, responsibility and freedom.  However a steadfast faith in free market economics (in general) should not be confused with a belief in market anarchy.\n\nThe nature of internet neutrality is not hostile to the free market unless we are absolutely devoid of nuance in our appreciation of the market.  Even a fan favorite Republican, Teddy Roosevelt, understood that there are certain protections for the spirit of free enterprise that must guarantee a de facto fair trading place if we can expect the merits of a free market to rule.\n\nConsumers do not have the power to choose a different supply if the majority of a primary resource is controlled by a de facto aristocracy like a fief who does not rely on the traditional rules we come to expect that allows clear winners and losers to emerge.  In smalltown Louisiana a simple matter of anti-business, anti-competitor practices carried out by super chains create an economic dependency where choice is robbed of the consumer, because a manipulation of resources guarantees that the success or failure of a local market is irrelevant, because national and international resources will be pumped into defeating competition until the consumer is left with only a single choice.\n\nThis Wal-Mart Effect is a dangerous possibility with the repeal of internet neutrality.  The internet in its earliest days was a luxury of those that could afford personal PCs, leisure time, and the chance to browse an emerging technology.  So much of our cultural, economic, and social strata is now definitively affected by our access to the internet.  Most of our president's decrees, in fact, are more accessible through the internet than traditional press means.\n\nAnd with this murky territory that the internet exists in, somewhere between a service and a utility, the Republican Party, as the majority holders in Congress and the \"face\" of current domestic policy, are in effect telling the people of the United States that this borderline utility, even our very access to the President's preferred method of communication, should be arbitrated by private holding gatekeepers.  This amounts to, quite literally, the digital age's equivalence of emerging railroad barons, who guarantee access for the few that enrich the already industrious elite, on the back of infrastructure that is consistently already facilitated by public means.\n\nThe repeal of internet neutrality is a matter that will, indisputably, occur in the future.  Aristocratic style monopolies have never existed in perpetuity and the dangerous tycoon fostering that the FCC's proposed revocation will insure guarantees that in time this FCC repeal *will* be overturned.\n\nHowever in that time the Republican Party will have suffered the irreparable damage of being the facilitators of this madness.  The historic damage will be done and after 8 years of the face of Democrats the Republicans, in their first year of power, will have tarnished their reputation so thoroughly that in future films casting directors will ask for Bella Lugosi look alikes to play the Republican leaders in biopics about this event.\n\nIf the Republican Party hopes to retain seats and my loyalty they must demonstrate that they believe in the principles of a fair market, not the creation of a nobility class that controls one of the most important means of communication and business in our time so that anti-capitalist exploits will keep us in a digital dark age.\n\nI implore you to use anything within your power to block this attempt to repeal net neutrality in the spirit of Republican values."}, {"comment_id": "dq6j60j", "post_id": "7en6do", "comment": "Is there anyway a guy in England can help??"}, {"comment_id": "eifnbeq", "post_id": "b0mizy", "comment": "Didn\u2019t this just get mentioned as something that should happen just the other day on the Joe Rogan podcast?"}, {"comment_id": "eifvtwf", "post_id": "b0mizy", "comment": "There was also an article in Wired a couple days ago that hit the front page.  \n\nhttps://www.wired.co.uk/article/amazon-autism-fake-cure-books"}, {"comment_id": "eifup2f", "post_id": "b0mizy", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "eifowkg", "post_id": "b0mizy", "comment": ">Rogan\n\nYep"}, {"comment_id": "eifvnfv", "post_id": "b0mizy", "comment": "Yep.

The only reason shouting fire in a public theater has an exemption from free speech is because it can cause confusion and an emergency situation. \n\nSince fire spreads fast people don't have time to assess the situation- they need to act now and get out of the building. This urgency and inability to calmly analyze the situation is the only reason why that law passed. \n\nThe vaccine debate is much different. It's a very slowly unfolding discussion that's been taking place for decades or even centuries in some cases. There is no chance that it's going to cause an immediate panic since people feel the need to act immediately.\n\nAlso, about Schenk v. United States, another key thing doesn't apply here. The judge claimed said that expressions which in the circumstances were intended to result in a crime and posed a \"clear and present danger\" of succeeding, could be punished. This was in reference to telling men to avoid the draft, which is a crime. This clearly does not apply in the vaccination debate because it's not illegal to avoid getting vaccinated.

None of us remember what we did as children\u2013we think we do, but we don\u2019t remember it as it really happened. Intuitively, the Losers knew they had to be together again.

The part that makes the book scary isn't the clown per se it's the fact that kids are being killed; no one wants to float. So his comment about \"only paying attention to the gang bang\" is odd.

But at 12 (and eleven), you're a complete person in your own mind, except you know there is this huge *thing* on the horizon - sex. It's all you talk about and think about, and it's intrinsically bound up with the idea of being \"grown-up\". It's the final frontier. So to me, at eleven, the idea that Bev would have sex with the rest of the gang to \"become grown-ups\" and rob IT of some of its power wasn't just logical; *it was the only thing that made sense*.\n\nWould I have felt differently, like you do, if I'd read it later in life? Probably. The urge as an adult to protect children coupled with the natural tendency to remember ourselves as innocents, despite everything, is strong and makes the adult mind recoil from the thought of children having sex. We don't want to acknowledge that kids of 12 having sex is, not common, put *far* from rare - if you think back, I'm sure we all had a few friends who \"did it\" way earlier than the rest off us. \n\nAnyway.

While there'll still be parents who take back the 2 dollars from their kids, I guess they'd be a minority. If it's actually like that, I definitely *do* like it, because the kid gets an actual tangible reward themselves, and gets a positive reward for reading, while the parents aren't that strongly incentivized to force their kids to read.

Software usually just registration code for a login to some shitty 90s era site.\n\n* Splitting books. A semester before me microeconmics and macroeconomics were one book. When I started taking economics series they split it into two books with the same price as one book. They did the same with accounting and intro programming course. Before I left they were thinking of splitting three Calculus courses into two books: Single variable (1 & 2) and multivariable (3). \n\n* Self published books. I had two professors who self published books. One was a pretty standard elective math course for math majors (graph theory), the professor made everyone buy his book online for $200. It was one of those cheaply published books with terrible print quality and falls apart. It was only 250 pages long.  Speaking of which...\n\n* Shitty quality not worth the price. Usually these are thick paperback books (looking at you CS and English) that falls apart within two weeks. You would think it would reduce cost your end. Nope! These still cost $150+. You can't sell them because they fall apart. By the end of the course books have broken sounds, loose pages falling out, and thin flimsy cover bent to hell and back.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "ehx7hvb", "post_id": "axym8m", "comment": "I can see why they'd split econ and accounting courses, managerial and financial accounting are fairly different, an the same with macro and micro economics."}, {"comment_id": "ehx13lj", "post_id": "axym8m", "comment": "Being born in '81 was a good time to be born.

Once we got to chapter books, after we finished a book (not every book, but a lot of them) we would do an activity that related to that book.  So when we read *From the Mixed up Files of Mrs. Basil E Frankweiler,* we went to the Metropolitan Museum of Art; when we read *My Side of the Mountain,* we went camping; when we read *Kavik the Wolf Dog,* we went to a wolf sanctuary; when we read *Misty of Chincoteague,* we went to Chincoteague.

In addition, she's portrayed as a trophy to be won by both Ben and Bill, and at the end of the childhood sequence, when they are lost in the sewers after defeating It, Bev decides she needs to _have sex with all the boys in order to restore their unity._ Which King describes in uncomfortable detail over the next few pages. I'm not saying adolescent sexuality should be a totally off-limits topic, but the scene does nothing valuable for the novel, reinforces the only female character as defined as a sexual object, and is a little creepy seeing as how Bill is an obvious proxy for King himself.!<  \n  \nI could go on. Like I said, I enjoyed _It_ as a whole. The novel has a fascinating antagonist and does a great job of framing a story around different experiences of childhood trauma. But it's very long and not necessarily for the better, and it suffers from some seriously disturbing and bad representation. Yes, the novel was written in the '80s, but that doesn't mean it should be immune to criticism of representation."}, {"comment_id": "ezl83hr", "post_id": "d1cinq", "comment": "Dated a gal in college for a while who was an English lit major, she hadn't read any King and would give me lighthearted shit about loving his stuff.\n\nWhen he was selected to edit one of the \"best American short stories\" editions she was assigned for a class, she gave him a chance and the tune changed...

You can see it in a lot of his longer works that stretch to 1000 pages (I prefer the shorter version of *The Stand*, find *IT* to have too much bloat, and think *Needful Things* could've been half as long given it's ultimately just a sick joke about capitalism) but even in some of his shorter works (*Revival* is a lean, haunting 300-pager stretched to 400 with a lot of less interesting memoir stuff). His tendency as an \"intuitive\" writer (he doesn't plan out his stories, he \"finds them as he goes\") means that some of his stories fumble not only at the ending but well before (*The Tommyknockers*, *Dreamcatcher*, *Insomnia* are all strangely overpacked affairs).\n\nI say all of that while adding that he'll always be one of my favorite writers because of his instinctive ability to create a vivid character in a few lines, and his killer \"hooks\" (what if a hotel was haunted? what if vampires overran a small town? etc.), and his ability to use those premises to say something true. Books like *Carrie*, *The Dead Zone*, *The Green Mile*, and even longer works like *The Stand* and *11/22/63*. They have meaning and poignancy, in both the larger arcs and the smaller moments of verisimilitude."}, {"comment_id": "ezlsn4i", "post_id": "d1cinq", "comment": "Survivability increases incrementally with each line of blow.

Especially his books that get overly-supernatural with the ending, those suck. Notably Under the Dome. I HATED that ending to an otherwise amazing novel.
