Personally I just saw the movie for the first time last night (not sure if I am compelled to read the book yet or not; I understand there's more depth to the story, but...I have a huge backlog of books in preferred genres to get to first)\n\nThey didn't include her first or (second?) child in the movie, but yes I found the character very self-absorbed and manipulative of others throughout, and especially at the beginning. However, it is true that after the scenes you are talking about she goes through some very harrowing experiences and seems to develop a lot of interesting depth as a character, even though she remains far from perfect. She has others depending on her and vows to protect her home and others in her care by working hard and doing absolutely whatever it takes, despite a great deal of judgement and condemnation for most of how she chooses to do so. She sacrifices a lot of her own happiness to achieve practical ends for herself and her homestead.\n\nIt's a four hour movie but she remains very delusional about Ashley and mostly quite unhappy throughout, but everything she does is for a clearly rational (if completely self-interested) reason. She's at best very misguided, at worst mentally ill. But not irredeemable.\n\nShe does reach a sort of final cathartic revelation by the end of the story which I found myself thinking I wished she'd reached much, much earlier. But there's something very ... depressingly realistic... about it, and poignant. In spite of the fact that 90% of her problems seem to be self inflicted and she's quite a piece of work, I couldn't help but have a fairly strong sympathy for her and feel very moved by her failed pursuit of happiness. She's obviously a very seriously  flawed person, but also probably a pretty 'real' and interesting person. I don't admire the character but I feel like she's understandable and sort of sympathetic in spite of her many faults, which is a rare but commendable thing in a character study.\n\nI can see why it's a famous story and it actually came across to me a little surprising and refreshing just how flawed Scarlett is. I was expecting a sappy romantic epic with a airheaded but pure damsel in distress. It isn't that at all. . It wasn't quite a typical romance or drama or tragedy, but somewhere in between all three, and the ending and overall tone were very impactful."}, {"comment_id": "emeiki0", "post_id": "bk7bhp", "comment": "I don\u2019t read a lot of general fiction, but that one tore my heart up!

More often than not the context clues will be enough to infer meaning, and eventually the seemingly non-sense words will become an extension of your vocabulary.

Kubrick (and the first few US pressings of the novel, for that matter) doesn't address the final Chapter of the novel, which is really the kicker that drives the whole over-arching themes of redemption/improvement/self home.
