The characters, their actions, their feelings, are described in such a way that is difficult to describe. When I read Victor Hugo or Alexandre Dumas, I think they give a depth of detail that is excessive at times.   \n\n\nTolstoy gives just enough of an explanation of setting and detail to enhance what he really excels at, that is, giving characters life, emotion, trials, and triumphs. He leverages the locations and moods of a setting just to tweak a character's feelings ever so slightly; but then over the course of the whole work, you find that each small interaction and setting is perfectly calculated to bring about dramatic changes in who his characters are.  \n\n\nI highly recommend that you keep reading. Levin is one of my favorite characters, but I believe that is due to the contrast derived from Anna's story side by side.

It shows the weakness of aristocracy when a man is called upon to serve in an important position just because Prince Vasili didn\u2019t want to be nagged by the man\u2019s mother. Merits are not factored, decisions are not vetted. It was a favor to an old friend who helped the Prince get ahead. \n\nPrince Andrew\u2019s feelings towards his wife. It wasn\u2019t out of frustration, or anger. He was sure about he felt about marriage and his dismissiveness to the lives of women.  He\u2019s on an extreme with loathing his marriage, but is she? She obviously knows something is wrong communication wise, but she doesn\u2019t seem to be at his level or be aware of how little he values her. \n\nThe women are mostly homogenous. They are all pretty little flowers, with beautiful eyes, and they are social butterflies and that\u2019s all they seem to be, at least for now. \n\nAnna is the most interesting of the women. The commentary on her playing hostess was interesting. Working the room, breathing life into staid conversations, moving people around, quelling furor or political incorrectness. Her parlors hosting the most prominent of Russian society are sure to be a focal point in the narrative. \n\nPierre is interesting. A wayward youth with the world at his finger tips but he is distracted by debauchery. Sounds familiar? He plays a character we can easily find in contemporary times and likely any era of history. No mentor. Not even a man he respects, like Prince Andrew, could convince him to right his ship. He believes a promise can be broken because he may die any day. This must be a long held belief unchallenged that cannot be changed overnight. The lack of will and discipline on his part will destine him for failure. It\u2019s the story of a youth of any era in history. \n\nIs Hippolyte\u2019s flirtation with Prince Andrew\u2019s wife one sided buffoonery or it will it be something more? Especially given the issues with her marriage. \n\nThe views towards the war against France and the disparate opinions of Napoleon are fascinating. Is he a great man, or a monster?Even hindsight can provide such debate, but I wonder how many figures in history have gone through such passionate and divergent discussion before a dominant narrative survived the ages. The breakdown of how countries and their interests are viewed is fascinating. "}, {"comment_id": "ds4ovu9", "post_id": "7nuw0l", "comment": "Thanks so much for writing this up!

Meanwhile he\u2019s preparing himself to go off to war against the greatest general Europe has seen for decades. He\u2019ll have the responsibility of the country on his shoulders and meanwhile his wife is hounding him about the need not to go. Does she understand that she doesn\u2019t have that status in society without his responsibilities, which include going to war, dying, being responsible for the deaths of others and potentially the destruction of the nation?\n\nMaybe the characters are there to show the conflict between the needs of the country and the needs of the family.

Is it because Russia is allied with England and Austria against France, or is there another reason?\n\nI think a lot of it is that Russia is allied with England and Austria against France, but I think the rise of Napoleon represents the end of the aristocratic way of life in Europe.  There was a conversation that jumps out at me: \n\n> \u201c[Pierre said] [t]hose were extremes, no doubt, but they are not what is most important. What is important are the rights of man, emancipation from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in full force.\u201d \n\nTo which the viscount replies:\n> \u201cLiberty and equality,\u201d said the vicomte contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously to prove to this youth how foolish his words were, \u201chigh-sounding words which have long been discredited. Who does not love liberty and equality? Even our Saviour preached liberty and equality. Have people since the Revolution become happier? On the contrary. We wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed it.\u201d\n\nI think this conversation sums up the feelings the aristocrats have towards Bonaparte. \n\nAlso, apparently when they refer to Buonaparte with a u, its supposed to be diminutive? Not sure where i heard that. \n\n>What exactly is Pierre doing wrong? I can\u2019t figure it out, but I think his \u201ceducation\u201d is going to play a big part in the story.\n\nI think it's his support of Napoleon and the ideals of \"equality and freedom\" that Anna Pavlovna consider a faux pas. Good point about his \"education,\" I do think his education, really his induction into Russian high society, as well as his education abroad (where he probably started to value things such as liberty and equality) will be a huge plot / philosophical point.

I'm a sucker for grey and conflicted characters, Boromir from LOTR, Svidrigailov from C&P. A man with some contrast. We'll see where the rest go.\n\nLoved Andrey's speech on marriage and freedom, as well as Pierre's self-sabotage of his own integrity. He's loveable. \n\nI'm waivering between three translations to see which affects me the most: Maude, Briggs, and Garnett. I have a sweet spot for Garnett from my Crime & Punishment days, so I'm giving her precedent. Briggs seems to read easier, but it's not necessarily the easy read that I want, it just might take a little more work to read the older english. \n\nI hope to see some of the other characters drawn out from their veils and their comfort. Everyone's so stuffy! I didn't find the whole party very entertaining, but Tolstoy's way of betraying each character's thoughts and intentions through the revelation of small bodily gestures is really great so far.

Isn\u2019t it great?\u201d, which segues me into thought #2 I had about Pierre, which is that because he\u2019s a bastard and therefore intrinsically a black sheep/social outcast, he desires approval of the upper caste (conversely, this is precisely why Anna is afraid of his appearance at her soir\u00e9e of upper caste guests\u2014he\u2019s not one of them). I think if you were to take anyone who is a) young but well educated, and b) somewhat of a social outcast growing up, you would get someone very much in the mold of Pierre. Third and final thought on Pierre is that because he grew up as a social outcast (and, to be clear, I\u2019m making some assumptions here based on the reading...that he is a social outcast is never explicitly stated), and because he studied abroad, he did not have the mentor or father figure around to teach him how to be a responsible, mature man, hence his propensity to hang out with Anatole &amp;amp; Dolokhov and  his reputation for making questionable decisions (another reason Anna doesn\u2019t want him around).  \n-Andrei I\u2019m still processing...he clearly has limitless confidence, but why is he bored with his life &amp;amp; blaming her for essentially holding him down? Feels like he may be compensating or shifting blame for something...hoping the next few chapters reveal something else about him.  \n-Anna is pretty clearly a well-connected upper caste socialite. I think she feels threatened by Napoleon because his pending conquest of Russia would spell doom for her way of life.\nHoping to chime in with more thoughts tonight...this is a great read so far.

For me that has expanded my interest and knowledge of overlooked parts of history.

It flashed from the woodwork and the walls; it smote him with an awful, total power, as if generated by a vast mill. It rose from the floor, up out of the tattered gray wall-to-wall carpeting. It unleashed itself from the broken and semi-broken appliances in the kitchen, the dead machines which hadn't worked in all the time Isidore had lived here. From the useless pole lamp in the living room it oozed out, meshing with the empty and wordless descent of itself form the fly-specked ceiling. It managed in fact to emerge from every object within his range of vision, as if it - the silence - meant to supplant all things tangible. Hence it assailed not only his ears but his eyes; as he stood by the inert TV set he experienced the silence as visible and, in its own way, alive. Alive.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think Silence also relates to the theme of empathy in OP's discussion prompt. Deckard considers how empathy is a prey trait, something only a herbivore or omnivore has the time, need, and capacity to cultivate.  Here, Silence is a predator that is stalking Isidore and anyone else left on the planet.  Silence has no empathy.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThanks for opening up the discussion!

Not really related, but a nice sheep to sheep transition.  \n\nThe idea of the Owl as a reward, but also something that would make Deckard a target is also interesting.  Owls being a symbol of wisdom, being extinct, and being night hunters all tie in nicely with Deckard's character.  \n\nHis other animal choices are also interesting, the Ostrich being flightless and awkward, maybe non-confrontational (head in the sand), but also rare and commanding a high price.  Or the horse, a majestic animal which lacks the space it needs to roam freely.  And finally the electric sheep that he currently has, sheep bring to mind practicality, acting as a source of wool and potentially also food (though not in the context of this story.)

There are \"phantoms\", \"fiends\", and \"a black, horned thing\" that watches a crowd by the \"gallows\". Despite the morbid quality of the pictures, Jane is still attracted to them. She even sits in a darkened room that is \"shrined in double retirement\" (via the closed curtains) while she stares at the pictures.\n\nThen there's the traumatic scene in the Red Room -- what a great name for a haunted room -- where in the darkness of night she feels the presence of her dead uncle, represented by a miniature figurine and the moving light on the walls.\n\nWhile Jane is headstrong, she also seems to be sensitive to the past, even haunted by it, so much so, that the recent events have now colored her present. The next day, she rhymes \"all was eerie and dreary\" while discovering not even the sugary allure of Bessie's tart dessert, or the illustrated charms of her favorite book, *Gulliver's Travels*, can brighten her spirit and mind.\n\nSo why begin the story of a young Jane with all this dark imagery?\n\nPerhaps it's because Jane is an orphan, so she feels like there's a black hole in her life. The tragedy of her parents' death is a looming darkness over her.\n\nThis element of darkness, or of a haunted past, also made me wonder about the narrative voice used in the novel.\n\nThe story isn't told via ten-year-old Jane's voice, but from an adult Jane, whom we know nothing about yet.\n\nThis adult Jane is speaking to us from somewhere in the future timeline of the novel, so adult Jane is the narrator, not child Jane.\n\nWhy is adult Jane talking to us?\n\nIs adult Jane still haunted by the past? Is this why she is writing/telling us her story? Is her life still a mystery for her to unravel?\n\nPerhaps future-adult Jane has finally found happiness, and she now wants to shine a light into the darkness of her youth. Some things can only be examined once we are far enough away from it (via the distance of time).\n\nMaybe this is why Jane's world begins on a gray day (\"cold winter wind\", \"clouds so sombre\", \"rain so penetrating\"), which is a mix of both light and dark. It marks a turning point, from darkness to the beginnings of light.\n\nFor little Jane, her past is tragic, her present is miserable, and her future is unclear. It's all very *eerie and dreary* indeed, but it's also precisely because of the grayish weather that little Jane's future will possibly brighten. Her daily walk is cancelled by rain which sets up a series of tumultuous events that propel Jane to leave the Reed family home for boarding school.\n\nAnother thing I found interesting about the narrator is the narrator's continual need to correct things, a sense of urgency to make things right.\n\nOften when describing her ten-year-old experiences, adult Jane will often interject herself, filtering little Jane's feelings through adult Jane's mind. This indirectly reminds the reader there are two Janes, not just one.\n\nFor instance, when the apothecary, Mr. Lloyd, questions ten-year-old Jane about her unhappy thoughts, before we hear child Jane speak, adult Jane tells us why little Jane is unable to truthfully answer:\n\n>\u201cWhat other things? Can you tell me some of them?\u201d  \n>  \n>**How much I wished to reply fully to this question! How difficult it was to frame any answer! Children can feel, but they cannot analyze their feelings; and if the analysis is partially effected in thought, they know not how to express the result of the process in words.**\n\nIt's as if adult Jane is protecting little Jane, explaining things to the reader on her (little's Jane's) behalf.\n\nAdult Jane acts as a parent to little Jane -- perhaps like the parent she always wish she had. While Jane of course lost her parents, at least through the act of narration, she can now provide one for the written-version of her childhood self.\n\nWhat's also particularly interesting about this passage is the reason given on why little Jane cannot express her feelings. It's because little Jane lacks the language to do so.  \"Children can feel,\" adult Jane narrates, \"but they cannot analyze their feelings\".\n\nIt's though language that one can analyze their feelings, and without this language skill, \"they know not how to express the result of the process in words.\"\n\nExpressing one's feelings is a process done in thought, and thought requires language.\n\nSo adult Jane is providing that language for child Jane, processing feelings into words, giving voice to little Jane so we can know her inner thoughts. Again, adult Jane is acting as an parent or guardian to little Jane, but via the power of storytelling and narration.\n\nAs we read, it'll be interesting to see if there is indeed a looming mystery that the narrator/adult Jane is trying to solve. Perhaps there isn't one. Maybe it's just a narrator trying to provide closure on her life story, one that began in darkness.\n\nIt's not surprising then, at the end of Chapter Four, we see little Jane leaving the dreary Reed home, and we see the first sparkling of light, as little Jane notices with a newfound cheeriness:\n\n>Even for me life had its gleams of sunshine."}, {"comment_id": "eqhf86u", "post_id": "bygfxg", "comment": "This is my first time reading this book as well. I enjoy Jane\u2019s spunkiness and tenacity. I also enjoyed how easy this novel is too read despite being first published in 1847.\n\nSome symbolism that I saw was present in the red room, where Jane was sent to after the altercation with John Reed. The Red Room, to me, symbolized the isolation that Jane felt while living at Gateshead. For example, the room was, \u201c seldom slept in\u201d, despite being one of the \u201clargest and stateliest chambers in the mansion\u201d. The room was, \u201csilent... remote from the nursery and kitchen\u201d. Jane, throughout these chapters, was constantly ignored and degraded by Mrs. Reed, so I think the room is a great symbol of the distance between Jane and the rest of the family. This distance is supported by Mrs. Reed, further cemented when she sends Jane off to Lowood.\nA quote that I highlighted was: \u201chuman beings must love something, and, in the dearth of worthier objects of affection, I contrived to find a pleasure in loving and cherishing a graven image, shabby as a miniature scarecrow. I believe Bronte through this quote, along with the red-room and Jane\u2019s status as an orphan highlightsJane\u2019s isolation from others. I think this isolation will be explored throughout the novel, but I\u2019m also curious to what other symbols and themes may arise."}, {"comment_id": "eqi6b05", "post_id": "bygfxg", "comment": "I don't have much difficulty to suspend my disbelief. For me, the story is told from the perspective of adult Jane, who probably can put words of what she was feeling and thinking as a child. Plus, I found interesting the idea that she supposed part of her mistreatment is because she is different from other children, precisely because she is level-headed, reasonnable and mature. People cannot accept that this is her nature and rather assumed that it is a sort of manipulation or a behavioir unfit of a child. This is reinforced by the sudden compassion she received from Bessie when she is ill, like this is a bout of normality Bessie can relate to."}, {"comment_id": "eqibfh4", "post_id": "bygfxg", "comment": "First of all, this is also my first read, so I don't know what to expect either. \n\nAs for the suspension of disbelief, I read it as filtered through adult-Jane; as though adult-Jane (the narrator) is retrospectively increasing the maturity of her younger self. She's the heroine of her own story, and around the structural points of her life, she can add whatever pluck and courage to her young self as she wants.\n\n> Also, I can\u2019t stop laughing about the scene where she\u2019s so sure that Mr. Reed, deceased, would be so indignant at her treatment that he\u2019d rise from the dead to help her, and she freaks out because she\u2019s afraid of ghosts. A+. \n\nI agree - that was great. :)\n\nI'm enjoying the prose so far, and am looking forward to seeing what happens next.

I really liked the intrusions of the narrator (i.e. older Jane) in the text.\n\n I've noticed a few things:\n\n- on Chapter 4, after Jane \"told her truths\" to Mrs Reed, we can notice the use of military notions. She feels like she defeated her opponent. She won. \n\"I was left there alone- winnder of the field. It was the hardest battle I had fought, and the first victory I had gained. I stood awhile on the rug, where Mr Brocklehurst had stood, and I enjoyed my conqueror's solitude.\"\n\n- I've also liked the theme of religion. This is a hypothesis (I am not sure about what I'm about to say) but when Mr Brocklehurst asks her if she enjoys reading the Bible, she answers:\n\"I like Revelatons, and the Book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel and a little bit of Exodus and some parts of Kings and Chronicles and Job and Jonah.\"\n\nWell, knowing her condition (especially her exclusion from the family and her confinement to some very restricted, specific rooms), I've read this as she enjoys the parts of the Bible that speaks about \"breaking free\" from an oppressive system I feel the Books chosen mean something...

Jane seems inspired -- in the sense of getting knowledge from outside herself -- in attacking Mrs. Reed.  The \"tabernacle\" of the bed where Mr. Reed died -- I'm holding the possibility there will be some supernatural aspect, that his spirit (or some other) is giving her the ability to attack Mrs. Reed.  Mrs. Reed has some vulnerability -- the reader's aware of it where Jane the 10-year-old isn't -- if Jane the narrator at a later date knows, she's not telling.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe line about how she can see, as she writes, that it is understandable and, if not okay, commonplace for them to have behaved cruelly is also odd:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"...had I been a sanguine, brilliant, careless, exacting, handsome, romping child\u2014though equally dependent and friendless\u2014Mrs. Reed would have endured my presence more complacently; her children would have entertained for me more of the cordiality of fellow-feeling; the servants would have been less prone to make me the scapegoat of the nursery. \"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMemorable lines to me -- that John reed would stick out his tongue enough to the point of pain, this is a  sensually vivid line \"he spent some three minutes in thrusting out his tongue at me as far as he could without damaging the roots\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\"It's you who are deceitful\" -- this too is vivid: \"Shaking from head to foot, thrilled with ungovernable\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso noticeable, and it seems a bit awkward, is how Bessie and Jane suddenly become affectionate -- not that it's unrealistic, but it doesn't seem like symmetrical/linear plotting.   You'd think there would be a catalog of unremitting horrors, or a dangling hope, not just an alleviation.  \n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd why is there the long period of waiting around Christmas, and why specifically calling out the 15th of January that she's feeding the robin and Mr. Brocklehurst shows up --  this *is* an early novel but usually one expects there to be reason for details like this when they're provided."}, {"comment_id": "eqkyj2m", "post_id": "bygfxg", "comment": "This is also my first read.

If certain paragraphs leave you confused, don't let it get you down or intimidate you. Scan over the words that he's stringing together, and the images that they bring to mind, and look for the feeling/idea that he's trying to convey instead of a more direct flow of information.

That's what's happening here - he sees Death with his coat and knows that it's nearly time, and in the face of that everything he has accomplished (re: rest of the poem: not much), and has yet to accomplish, wavers in front of that realization. \n\n>Do I dare\n\n>Disturb the universe?\n\n>In a minute there is time\n\n>For decisions and revisions which a minute will reverse\n\nWhat's the point?

What makes it so delicious is that it is a special kind of love song that we hadn't seen before: it is about the inability of a man to approach a woman. Notably, it's not about unrequited love or some other sad but beautiful thing - rather, Eliot writes about ugly, mundane feelings like cowardice or analysis paralysis, that seem unworthy of the great literary heroes he alludes to in this poem.  \n\nConsider, for instance, the many lines that indicate an almost sexual longing (sex is brought up a lot in this poem, but I'll keep it to the point):\n\n> And I have known the arms already, known them all\u2014\t\nArms that are braceleted and white and bare\t\n(But in the lamplight, downed with light brown hair! [...]\n\n>Is it perfume from a dress\t        \nThat makes me so digress?\t\n\nI appreciate when the sexuality creeps in at surprising moments:\n\n> And the afternoon, the evening, sleeps so peacefully!\t        \nSmoothed by long fingers,\n\nOr where he imagines the rejection of his advances by this woman:\n\n>Would it have been worth while,\t        \nTo have bitten off the matter with a smile,\t\nTo have squeezed the universe into a ball\t\nTo roll it toward some overwhelming question [...]\n\n> If one, settling a pillow by her head,\t\n  Should say: \u201cThat is not what I meant at all;\t\n  That is not it, at all.\u201d\n\nThe poem seems like a Frankenstein of many poems in one, but on a close reading, I think we arrive at a pretty concrete setting in a high society drawing room where our hero is trying to get up the nerve to speak to a girl and imagines all the horrible judgments she and her friends have of him:\n\n> (They will say: \u201cHow his hair is growing thin!\u201d)\t\nMy morning coat, my collar mounting firmly to the chin,\t\nMy necktie rich and modest, but asserted by a simple pin\u2014\t\n(They will say: \u201cBut how his arms and legs are thin!\u201d)\n\nThe narrator drifts between reality and a selection of alternate worlds, either personal or allegorical, and the famous line\n\n> In the room the women come and go\t        \nTalking of Michelangelo.\n\nis used to bring us back to where he is physically. Eliot uses the same technique in The Waste Land (2, A Game of Chess) - \"HURRY UP PLEASE IT'S TIME\" - to shift between an allusive conversation and the fact that it's happening between two working class patrons at a pub. The line is used as a sharp contrast between the imagined world of his cultural heritage and the gritty modern world he inhabits. \n\nThe tragic irony of the poem is in the contrast of the real and the ideal. In considering his dilemma, Prufrock imagines himself in the shoes of the great characters of the western canon - Hamlet, Lazarus, Dante - but cannot get away from the fact that his \"overwhelming question\" is common and stupid in comparison to what they faced. Eliot expands that idea to an overall contrast between the tenets of Romantic literature and the gritty self-effacing reality of the modern world. He absolutely builds up to existential questions, riding a bit on the coattails of Hamlet and Death with a capital D, but the underlying current of the poem is always that, for people like Prufrock (that is to say, people like Eliot and the reader), these existential questions are \"among the porcelain\", so to say - insignificant, in a global context. To mix metaphors, this poem reminds me of Gorky's \"little man\". The biggest clue is, I think, in the title: \"Love Song\" and \"J. Alfred Prufrock\" belong in two completely different worlds. \n\nIn the end the narrative is flipped again and the rejection of a woman becomes the death of a fantasy:\n\n> We have lingered in the chambers of the sea\t\nBy sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\t      \nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.\n\nI first read this poem as a young teen and was immediately affected, and though I've read much poetry since (and been through the customary \"Eliot is for people who don't read after high school\" grilling in college), it remains hands down unquestionably my favorite poem ever. I know it by heart and I still discover new things with every readthrough. It was really interesting to read everyone's interpretations and musings. Thanks!"}, {"comment_id": "dqpjtjp", "post_id": "7h6o9s", "comment": "I absolutely love this poem. I've read a few of T.S. Eliot's poems and I would say I don't \"understand\" any (hopefully one day I will have read them so many times I will) but this one I feel I like the best, I don't need to understand everything to get a ton out of it.\n\nI read it for the first time only recently (a few months ago) and I feel like every time I read it again it's not only that I get something new out of it, but that I interpret it a bit differently each time. So much so that I can't remember which was my first interpretation.\n\nI think that my following ramblings are going to be \"amateur\" at best haha, but I've only recently started to be more deeply interested in poetry, so I'm sorry if they are way too obvious.\n\n---\n### The death of the author\n\nFirst things first though. I was watching this video on modern poetry by the university of Yale IIRC, and the interpretation given there was... lazy, in my opinion, but not without merit, and I would like to talk about it a bit.\n\nSo the professor's main thing was that the poem was Eliot talking to us not about the topic or theme in the poem itself (whichever topic or theme there is that was another matter) but he was talking about himself and his \"debut\" in the poetry world, and that this was supported by the fact that every question was about uncertainty and \"Do I dare?\" \"Would it have been worth while?\", etc., etc.\n\nNow, I heard all of it and tbh, I just do not like that interpretation, and as I said, I find it lazy. I definitely agree with the \"Death of the Author\" argument, but of course I do know that poetry is a whole 'nother beast since they are always personal and are a lot more \"emotional\" than usual literature. \n\nI still, however, think that believing you can get to know an author through what he writes is misguided, and absolutely not true. But when I think about it, at the end of the day, even if Eliot wanted to write about himself through the poem and \"A love song\" that doesn't stop me from reading it differently, which is, of course, the main thing about poetry, it being personal.\n\nAt least those are my thoughts on that interpretation.\n\n---\n\nNow onto the poem itself haah. \n\n### Mood\n\nAs I said at the beginning, what I really like about this poem is that I feel it's less about the exact meaning intended or telling a story (although I do think there is that) but more about setting a mood, not only through imagery itself, but also through the incessant questioning and the negatives.\n\nWhat mood? Well, to me is indecision, depression, maybe more particularly anxiety, with a tinge of low self-esteem. Which I think is also how the epigraph is related, yes, it is about secrecy and about [duality as some say](https://www.enotes.com/homework-help/assignment-coment-relation-between-epigraph-text-276354), but I think it's not about secrecy for secrecy's sake, but because of \"shame\", the anxiety and shame of saying the things Prufrock is telling us aloud. In that sense to me the whole poem seems to me someone talking to himself, as if he were talking to an imaginary other in his mind, like writing in a diary to another which is not supposed to ever read it.\n\n### Meaning\n\nI won't repeat myself any more than necessary, but I think if we look at it in its most superficial level, the story told is simple and kinda uninteresting: it's about a man that wants to ask a question (an overwhelming question) to a woman (probably a proposal) and he doesn't do it, \n\n>I have seen the moment of my greatness flicker,  \n>And I have seen the eternal Footman hold my coat, and snicker,  \n>And in short, I was afraid.  \n\nAnd in some sense this is like the musings of someone old regretting things (to this a bit later).\n\nBut it's not really about that, I don't think so, it's not about him not asking a question, it's about not doing anything worthwhile, of having always shied away from doing things, important things, because of fear or anxiety which leaves him feeling regretful for always being \"mediocre\" in that regard.\n\nThis ties in with the Hamlet part, I think. Prufrock feels like an unimportant character or actor in his own life, he is no Prince Hamlet, he's someone that appears from time to time to do something menial, to maybe even move along the plot, but nothing more; he is there, he might be useful, but of no importance.\n\nIn part this also ties in with what I think is what comes after the \"angriness\" and even resentment, which is the resignation to things being the way they are\n\n>For I have known them all already, known them all:  \n>Have known the evenings, mornings, afternoons,  \n>I have measured out my life with coffee spoons;  \n>I know the voices dying with a dying fall  \n>Beneath the music from a farther room.  \n\nbut not being able to get away from that constant cycle which is tiring and boring and mediocre, where your life is not measured on the experiences you've had or daring things you do, but with coffee spoons (I may be grasping at straws here though ahaha).\n\nAnd linked to this feeling of being not important in your own life or anywhere is why I like this two lines so much:\n\n> Do I dare  \n> Disturb the universe?\n\nbecause not only it gives us this image of him being indecisive about doing something, anything, but it also gives us the idea of Prufrock being a separate entity apart from the universe, of the universe being there calm and good and complete without Prufrock.\n\n### Time *^(^oh ^god, ^I'm ^so ^sorry, ^this ^is ^way ^too ^long)*\n\nI won't get too much into this for several reasons, but also because part of it is self-explanatory and the other I'm not sure enough to talk about.\n\nSo of course, I think that time is specially important in this poem in two ways. The first one is how much time the decisions take because of his indecision and revisions (also another line favorite of mine haha), almost as an excuse of taking the time of thinking things through while in reality it's about Prufrock not being able to take chances or make any decision.\n\nThe second is, which ties with the first I think, is how it feels, at least to me, like Prufrock ages with the poem itself, him starting youngish but starting to get old, and at the end I would argue (weakly argue) dying of old age.\n\n### The rest\n\nBut boy is there so much more! There are so many great lines, so much imagery and things I still can't even begin to understand of this poem and allusions I wouldn't know they are there if not because Norton says they are haha.\n\nAnd all of this is without getting into the more technical aspects which I'm in no way qualified to talk about and this has been way too long as it is.\n\n---\n\nWell anyways, thanks to whomever read part or all of it (congrats, actually).\n\nAnd if you were wondering, yes, I may be reading a bit too much of myself into the poem itself, isn't it wonderful?"}, {"comment_id": "dqp7y4y", "post_id": "7h6o9s", "comment": "Love this one. My view is that he invokes Hamlet because he is a lot like Hamlet in his uncertainty only his concerns are on a much smaller more personal scale, while Hamlet is dealing with issues of national governance - among others.\n\nI think the coffee spoons reference has to do with the way we arrange our days.

I can imagine how, \"Let us go then, you and I, / When the evening is pressed out against the sky...\" rolls off an eloquent student's tongue so easily it would sound like music. \n\n*To have squeezed the universe into a ball* Somehow this line defines the whole poem to me. Tense. Corrosive. Wise. It is a love song of the narrator's life despite it's perceived ugliness, it is the moments measured out in spoonfuls of coffee, it is a condensed retelling of heartbreak. It's insecurity against the unknown but still there is a hope for love. There is an active imagination that still desires to be young and potent. \n\n*By sea-girls wreathed with seaweed red and brown\nTill human voices wake us, and we drown.*\n\nIt reads to me there was a time when he wasn't so old and women loved him and he loved women.

It almost seems to be a character in of itself, changing it's face depending on what situation The Kid finds himself in.

I wanted to finish it because Cormic McCarthy is lauded as one of the leading American novelists and *Blood Meridian* seems to be considered his masterpiece. I did not love this book.\n\nI'll start with my positive thoughts. McCarthy has absolutely phenomenal imagery of landscape and nature. One of my favorite lines was \"Cancer, Virgo, Leo raced the ecliptic down the southern night and to the north the constellation of Cassiopeia burned like a witch's signature on the black face of the firmament.\" His violence also has great realistic yet almost poetic effects on the reader.\n\nDespite the fact that he manages to have these amazing powers over words, I dislike his prose immensely. He sentences have a plodding effect with missing words and overuse of \"and\" to string clauses together. I dislike all of his idiosyncratic stylings: lack of quotations, improper capitalization (\"spanish\"), etc. Perhaps he's aiming for a coarse, earthy atmosphere befitting the setting of the novel. I think that he's successful in that regard, but that did not add to my enjoyment of the book.\n\nI think that part of my failure to enjoy the book must stem from my practically nonexistent interest in the subject matter. I don't find the Wild West to be interesting. But beyond this, *Blood Meridian* lacked to a great degree what I enjoy a great deal about fiction, which is connection to the characters, introspection into their thoughts or ideas, depictions of characters who are relate-able, characters who even have separate personalities! For me, besides the judge, everyone seems some variation of terse cowboys living just to live. The characters nor the story were compelling to me, but rather an exercise of wading through events to reach the end of the book, while enjoying some nice nature on the way. I almost never wondered what would happen next or felt anxious for characters. \n\nI can understand aspects of *Blood Meridian* that obviously appeal to readers. I also think McCarthy is a very interesting author. However, this book did not appeal to me. This may come off as a bit of a rant, but honestly I don't think this is a *bad* book. I just think it a book that is at the far end of my tastes in fiction."}, {"comment_id": "c4jkkby", "post_id": "t45im", "comment": "Oh boy.

It matches up very well with my own takeaways that I posted. The only thing I would challenge is that Andrei is a sexist snob. Snob maybe, but I don't think we have enough evidence that he is sexist. One of the most interesting scenes in  this first section was his interaction with his wife and his lamenting over his marriage. He writes:\n\n\"Bonaparte when he worked went step by step toward his goal. He was free, he had nothing but this aim to consider, and he reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman and, like a chained convict, you lose all freedom! And all you have of hope and strength merely weighs you down and torments you with regret. *Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, vanity, and triviality---these are the enchanted circle I cannot escape from.* I am now going to the war, the greatest war there ever was, and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. I am very amiable and have a caustic wit... ...that stupid set without whom my wife cannot exist, and those women... If you only knew what those society women are, and women in general! My father is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in everything---that's what women are when you see them in their true colors! When you meet them in society it seems as if there were something in them, but there's nothing, nothing, nothing!\" (Emphasis mine.)\n\nThere is evidence of sexism here. Saying \"all women\" could just be a linguistic tic that many people commonly use even though they don't literally mean \"all\". Blaming women for his personal issues with his marriage is a mistaken blame that should fall more on the culture and traditions of the times that he did not bother to extricate himself from. \n\nI would argue, at this point in the story, he is mostly criticizing himself for having invested into activities he deems worthless and he is ascribing blame to being married to a superficial woman who surrounds herself with superficial women. \n\nEspecially in that society, but also in segments of society of any age, there exists those people that fit his description. Trivial and ornamental, as you yourself described the women. Likewise the women seemed flat to me, superficial and ornamental. I hold out hope they will turn into something more, but I acknowledge the possibility that many, most, or all of them will not turn out differently. Prince Andrei could instead be revealing to us what the truth is of many high class ladies in that society. That they are trivial, vain, balls, gossips, and drawing rooms. \n\nIt's sexist to think a woman *can't* be something more, it's not sexist to point out that women *aren't* something more. One is an opinion, and one is an observance of a fact. Whether the fact is all there is to know, remains to be seen.\n\nThe last thought experiment to prove my point would be a guessing game of how Andrei would react to a woman he might meet in the battlefield (if we would even see such a thing in this age). If she was capable and accomplished, would he shun her because he didn't believe a woman capable of such things? Or would he embrace her, admire her, and maybe even fall in love with her?\n\nI think the jury is still out on whether Andrei is a sexist or not. I have no idea which it will turn out to be, but I have evidence to believe it could be one or the other.

Who cares if he did poorly on some stupid test? He clearly has a great vocabulary - we can hear it in his thoughts. Then Hal opens his mouth and out rolls a perfectly articulated monologue about Kierkegaard, etc. I felt a rush of \"Yeah! He showed *them*!\" followed by a sense of shock when the deans responded in exactly the opposite of the way I expected, followed by total confusion when I realized my assumptions about Hal were wrong.

Or maybe he was under a lot of pressure with the Deans and snapped.\n\nEdit: After reading it again, I realize that even with the \"conversationalist,\" Hal might not have able to really talk, as evidenced by the \"Son?, Son?\" Though, I do think it might be a huge stretch to think he made up the complete conversation with the \"convo\" in his mind (the responses and what not), so I'll stick to my hypothesis of maybe he loses brain function when he gets stressed out, disturbed, or etc, which would be why he stopped talking/making sense.

So far, folks seem to have decided he's a misogynist etc. I can't help but think how much of this is a reflection of our/their times.\n\nSo far, while we've met some interesting women, all their strengths and smarts have been about social frivolities (eg, Anna Pavlovna is brilliant but at keeping conversations and parties going.) I don't think there were many opportunities for women to be full independent and interesting folks in society as they were relegated to keeping a house/raising kids. The ones who have done well or are richer get to run social functions (the balls, dinners, soirees) but nothing of substance.\n\nAndrei clearly hates that social world as he explained quite clearly to Pierre. Unfortunately, that is likely the only world (in 1800s Russia) that women were equal or superior to men in. \n\nSo, I'm not sure if Andrei is an actual  misogynist so much as he hates the roles women inhabit in that society. He seems like a smart guy, who is clearly interested in the more intellectual characters and wants something more, not the domestic life in which he's ended up. (I'd be very surprised if the marriage was his idea, I wonder if we'll get more clarification.)\n\nAlso, with Marya as the pretty girl thinking she's ugly trope, was that a trope back then? I don't recall having seen it much but I've only read a handful of books from this time period or before. I can't imagine Tolstoy invented it but I'm curious how widespread it was.
