I prefer to choose two for variety, but it is dependent on the availability of read runners. Because /u/surf_wax is running *War and Peace* as a Big Read (meaning it will take place over several months), we will continue to choose at least one book each month. We do not want anyone to be forced to wait four months to join in the discussion. \n\nIn addition, our [previous selections](https://www.reddit.com/r/bookclub/wiki/previous) are still open for comment. You can always post a new thread in reference to any books we have chosen at any time. If you didn't get to read a book before, you can still read it and post about it (be sure to mention it was a previous selection) and people will comment and discuss it with you. \n\nAlso, we will also have the Poem of the Week selection. That is being headed up by /u/surf_wax. We vote around the same time as the book selection week, and select 4-5 poems to be discussed on a set day of the week. All of the poems are freely available online. \n\nFinally, we also have the /r/bookclub [Official Discord server,](https://discord.gg/xh2F7Yj) where you can log on and talk about any books you are reading, want to read, look for suggestions, or have live discussions about the currently selected books.

A lot of people consider Garnett outdated, but I read the first few chapters of Garnett's translation and fully enjoyed it. I ended up purchasing MacAndrew's translation, and I like it a little bit better (seems to flow more). Garnett uses Victorian English, her translation is a bit more formal. If the formal language doesn't bother you, then I don't see a need to change translations. I've been comparing Garnett with MacAndrew and Garnett hasn't omitted anything (I've seen a criticism that she skipped over parts). It's all basically the same thing, just worded a bit differently. \n\nP&V is recommended all the time, but  I personally didn't care for their prose. The sentence structure felt clunky, and  other translations conveyed the meaning of the text in a better way to me. I seem to be in the minority with this opinion, but I suggest checking out [this article](http://www.patrikbergman.com/2017/07/23/choosing-best-karamazov-translation/) so you can compare the translations yourself. Other people have commented that they loved the P&V translation and found this version easier to read. The translation is good, but it's by no means the *best* or necessarily better than others. \n\nUltimately it comes down to personal preference, but I haven't heard of people getting a vastly different experience from reading different translations. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "ebxav4r", "post_id": "a6qhov", "comment": "Congrats!

The characters, their actions, their feelings, are described in such a way that is difficult to describe. When I read Victor Hugo or Alexandre Dumas, I think they give a depth of detail that is excessive at times.   \n\n\nTolstoy gives just enough of an explanation of setting and detail to enhance what he really excels at, that is, giving characters life, emotion, trials, and triumphs. He leverages the locations and moods of a setting just to tweak a character's feelings ever so slightly; but then over the course of the whole work, you find that each small interaction and setting is perfectly calculated to bring about dramatic changes in who his characters are.  \n\n\nI highly recommend that you keep reading. Levin is one of my favorite characters, but I believe that is due to the contrast derived from Anna's story side by side. Having one story without the other intertwined does not have the same, powerful effect."}, {"comment_id": "f03djs9", "post_id": "d1iwqb", "comment": "Made it to 110 or so.

In AK, Lev and his wife are the models for this social institution. Anna's downfall is built around her inability to find happiness in marriage.
