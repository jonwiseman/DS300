Many believed such an attempt would be a \"red line\" that would lead to impeachment. So what do we do now? I analyze that question and what this news means here.\n\n>**1/** First, here's the NYT story. The upshot is that last June Donald Trump *ordered* White House Counsel Don McGahn to fire Special Counsel Bob Mueller. McGahn refused and threatened to quit if Trump went forward with the firing. Ultimately, Trump relented.\n\n>**2/** Some will wonder why McGahn had enough sway with Trump to stop this from happening. That's a very good question to ask. First, note that McGahn was the attorney from Trump's winning presidential campaign, so the two have known each other and worked together for some time now.\n\n>**3/** Next, we have to remember that McGahn is a potential witness\u2014and, importantly, a potential witness *against Trump*\u2014in the Trump-Russia investigation. McGahn was present at nearly all the key moments in the Obstruction fact-pattern that Mueller is considering referring to DOJ.\n\n>**4/** If Mueller refers an Obstruction indictment to DOJ, DOJ will likely refer it to the House Judiciary Committee for consideration for articles of impeachment\u2014and whether or not such articles come out of that committee, America already knows Obstruction is an impeachable offense.\n\n>**5/** It's an impeachable offense because it already was for Bill Clinton\u2014per the Republican Party and its votes on impeachment in the House. So while Trump may only have had an inkling of this last June, he likely knew enough to see that McGahn was someone whose loyalty he needed.\n\n>**6/** McGahn is protected from ever testifying against Donald Trump on some issues\u2014but *not* if the conduct he is to be questioned about involves criminal conduct by the president. Remember that Don McGahn does *not* represent Donald Trump, he represents the Office of the President.\n\n>**7/** Definitionally and legally, criminal conduct is not considered within the recognized duties of a president, which means McGahn's role as an attorney for the Office of the President diverges from Trump's own legal interests as and when the president has acted illegally\u2014as here.\n\n>**8/** McGahn was present before and after the Comey firing, as Trump concocted pretexts for that illegal action and then\u2014afterward\u2014a coverup for what was a *Russia-based* decision to dump Comey. That decision was illegal for the previously cited reason about the office of president.\n\n>**9/** No constitutional provision or U.S. statute ever has\u2014or ever could\u2014authorize POTUS to commit a crime. This means that while Trump *is* allowed to fire Comey because, say, he doesn't like Comey's dress sense, he's *not* allowed to fire him to obstruct a criminal investigation.\n\n>**10/** So McGahn can rather readily be used as an Obstruction witness against Trump, not just because of the Comey firing but much else\u2014for instance attempts to pressure Congressional investigators to drop their probes or attempts to pressure Jeff Sessions into not recusing himself.\n\n>**11/** Trump was represented by Marc Kasowitz last June, and either Trump or Kasowitz would have sussed out that if Don McGahn quit the White House because he believed Trump was about to commit a *crime*\u2014and make no mistake, that'd pretty much be the basis\u2014it would be a catastrophe.\n\n>**12/** The firing itself would be a catastrophe politically, but if it occurred concurrent to McGahn quitting, the chances that McGahn would be drawn even further into the investigation as a witness against Trump would be *extremely* high. And we don't know what *else* McGahn knows.\n\n>**13/** Here's the problem: Trump didn't back off from firing Mueller because he decided it was wrong or outside his authority or\u2014better still\u2014a federal crime. \n\n>This is a *critical* point: the NYT establishes Trump *only* relented to keep McGahn from quitting as White House Counsel.\n\n>**14/** Indeed, there wouldn't have been any story for the NYT to report\u2014this would likely never have leaked\u2014if Trump had simply gone to McGahn for legal advice about firing Mueller, and McGahn had advised him not to do so, and Trump immediately relented in the face of such advice.\n\n>**15/** Rather, the NYT says that\u2014either on his own counsel or someone else's\u2014Donald Trump *ordered* McGahn to do something. He did *not* ask for his advice, he *ordered* him to fire Mueller. (It may have been Kasowitz's doing, as Kasowitz was urging Trump to go to war with Mueller.)\n\n>**16/** So what we know now is Trump had the criminal intent\u2014mens rea\u2014to Obstruct by firing his *second* person who was then investigating him, but no crime occurred because there was no actus reus (no act). The only reason there was no act was a key witness threatening to jump ship.\n\n>**17/** So Trump thinks he has the *authority* to fire Mueller, that doing so is *appropriate* and *warranted*, and he has the *willingness* to do so. Also (lest we forget) he has the willingness to *lie* about wanting to fire Mueller\u2014as he's now been lying about it for seven months.\n\n>**18/** When many many analysts, me included, were saying after Mueller's appointment that he needed to be protected ASAP from Trump firing him\u2014because we said that that attempt *would* be made\u2014such concerns were dismissed as conspiracy theory and the bill to protect Mueller stalled.\n\n>**19/** One effect of this breaking news therefore must be immediate passage of the bill to protect Mueller that was *only* not passed previously because the GOP told America\u2014and they were dead wrong\u2014that this president never had and would never have any intention of firing Mueller.\n\n>**20/** But it's more than that: Trump was willing to fire Mueller when his level of legal jeopardy was unclear, and Mueller had brought *no* indictments and secured *no* cooperation deals with top Trump national security aides. So what is Trump's temperature on firing Mueller *now*?\n\n>**CONCLUSION/** This is the last moment for Republicans to jump off the Trump ship in the eyes of history. Trump is the Titanic and the iceberg is *dead ahead*. He *will* try to fire Mueller\u2014a crime and impeachable as Obstruction. Congress must get on the right side of history *now*.\n\n>**NOTE/** There are other ancillary effects to this story: for instance, Bill Burck *must* now see that he needs to get the hell off two of the three cases he's currently working as attorney: Bannon, McGahn, and Priebus. Representing all three is no longer (really never was) tenable.\n"}, {"comment_id": "dt92age", "post_id": "7t12e6", "comment": "Eric Columbus\u200fVerified account \n@EricColumbus\n\nFollow Follow @EricColumbus\n\nMore Eric Columbus Retweeted Matthew Miller\n\n>Key point in tonight\u2019s NYT story: this isn\u2019t  Trump hatching a crazy plan and then changing his mind.

At least some of their coworkers and friends would have lived had NYC Republican Mayor Juliani approved funding for radio infrastructure upgrades that would have allowed radio transmissions to be carried from outside to inside buildings (i forget what the system is called). But Juliani is still their hero.\n\nSome of their coworkers and friends who subsequently died from illness and disease as a result of their presence that day and later days would still be alive if Republicans didn't fight damn near every funding bill that would have provided for their care. \n\nBut they still vote Republican and villify \"liberals\", Democrats, and \"minorities\".\n\nThey proudly fly \"Thin Blue Line\" flags outside their houses and have the bumper stickers on their car.

In responding to the news report, a White House spokesperson said that \n\n>When she became a federal employee in March, \u201cshe made clear that one of her reasons for doing so was to ensure that she would have access to government-issued communications devices and receive an official email account to protect government records.\n\nIvanka and Jared also had a private email address on the [Kushner family domain](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/10/02/jared-kushner-email-account-white-house-243389) that they used to send emails about travel, scheduling, and official White House documents.\n\nJared also used his private email [for official business](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/24/jared-kushner-private-email-white-house-243071). This was separate from his Kushner family account. The news about his and Ivanka's private email addresses broke on September 25, 2017. Eight days later, it was reported that their personal email accounts were [re-routed](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/10/03/exclusive-jared-kushners-personal-email-moved-trump-organization-computers-amid-public-scrutiny/728467001/) to computers run by the Trump Organization.\n\n[At least 4 other White House aides](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/25/us/politics/private-email-trump-kushner-bannon.html) used their personal email accounts for government business. This includes Steve Bannon, Reince Priebus, Gary Cohn, and Stephen Miller. The problem was widespread enough that, in July 2017, Priebus told aides to [store their phones in secure lockers](https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/25/trump-white-house-email-personal-243129) or leave them at home.

[In 1984, the Russian Mafia began to use Trump real estate to launder money and it continued for decades](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/is-there-a-case-for-trump-putin-collaboration-years-before-the-campaign/2018/08/16/00578f1e-9440-11e8-80e1-00e80e1fdf43_story.html). In 1987, the Soviet ambassador to the United Nations, Yuri Dubinin, arranged for Trump and his then-wife, Ivana, to enjoy an all-expense-paid trip to Moscow to consider possible business prospects. Only seven weeks after his trip, Trump ran full-page ads in the Boston Globe, the NYT and WaPO calling for, in effect, the dismantling of the postwar Western foreign policy alliance. The whole Trump/Russian connection started out as laundering money for the Russian mob through Trump's real estate, but evolved into something far bigger.\n\n\u25ba In 1984, David Bogatin \u2014 a Russian mobster, convicted gasoline bootlegger, and close ally of Semion Mogilevich, a major Russian mob boss \u2014 met with Trump in Trump Tower right after it opened. Bogatin bought five condos from Trump at that meeting. Those condos were later seized by the government, which claimed they were used to launder money for the Russian mob. (NY Times, [Apr 30, 1992](https://www.nytimes.com/1992/04/30/nyregion/entrepreneur-who-left-us-is-back-awaiting-sentence.html))\n\n\u25ba Felix Sater is a Russian-born former mobster, and former managing director of NY real estate conglomerate Bayrock Group LLC located on the 24th floor of Trump Tower. He is a convict who became a govt cooperator for the FBI and other agencies. He grew up with Michael Cohen--Trump's former \"fixer\" attorney. Cohen's family owned El Caribe, which was a mob hangout for the Russian Mafia in Brooklyn. Cohen had ties to Ukrainian oligarchs through his in-laws and his brother's in-laws. Felix Sater's father had ties to the Russian mob. This goes back more than 30 years.\n\n\u25ba Trump was $4 billion in debt after his Atlantic City casinos went bankrupt. No U.S. bank would touch him. Then foreign money began flowing in through Bayrock (mentioned above). Bayrock was run by two investors: Tevfik Arif, a Kazakhstan-born former Soviet official who drew on bottomless sources of money from the former Soviet republic; and Felix Sater, a Russian-born businessman who had pleaded guilty in the 1990s to a huge stock-fraud scheme involving the Russian mafia. Bayrock partnered with Trump in 2005 and poured money into the Trump organization under the legal guise of licensing his name and property management.\n\n\u25ba Semion Mogilevich was the brains behind the Russian Mafia. Mogilevich operatives have been using Trump real estate for decades to launder money. That means Russian Mafia operatives have been part of his fortune for years, that many of them have owned condos in Trump Towers and other properties, that they were running operations out of Trump's crown jewel. (Mogilevich's role today is unclear).\n\n\u25ba One of the most important things that is often overlooked is that the Russia Mafia is part and parcel of Russian intelligence. Russia is a mafia state. that is not a metaphor. Putin is head of the Mafia. So the fact that they have been operating out of the home of the president of the United States is deeply disturbing.\n\n\u25ba From Craig Unger's AMA: \"Early on, a source told me that all this was tied to Semion Mogilevich, the powerful Russian mobster. I had never even heard of him, but I immediately went to a database that listed the owners of all properties in NY state and looked up all the Trump properties. Every time I found a Russian sounding name, I would Google, and add Mogilevich. When you do investigative reporting, you anticipate drilling a number of dry holes, but almost everyone I googled turned out to be a Russian mobster. Again and again. If you know New York you don't expect Trump Tower to be a high crime neighborhood, but there were far too many Russian mobsters in Trump properties for it to be a coincidence.\"\n\n\u25ba  So many Russians bought Trump apartments at his developments in Florida that the area became known as Little Moscow. The developers of two of his hotels were Russians with significant links to the Russian mob. The late leader of that mob in the United States, Vyacheslav Kirillovich Ivankov, was [living at Trump Tower](https://newrepublic.com/article/143586/trumps-russian-laundromat-trump-tower-luxury-high-rises-dirty-money-international-crime-syndicate). \n\n\u25ba According to a Bloomberg investigation ([March 16, 2017](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/behind-trump-s-russia-romance-there-s-a-tower-full-of-oligarchs)) into Trump World Tower, which broke ground in 1998, \u201ca third of units sold on floors 76 through 83 by 2004 involved people or limited liability companies connected to Russia and neighboring states.\u201d\n\n\u25ba Here is the most prominent example: In July 2008, the height of the recession, Donald Trump sold a mansion in Palm Beach for $95 million to Dmitry Rybolovlev, a Russian oligarch. Trump had purchased it four years earlier for $41.35 million. The sale price was nearly $54 million more than Trump had paid for the property. Again, this was the height of the recession when all other property had plummeted in value. \n\n\u25ba As an example of the Russian mob operating out of Trump Tower, in 2013, Federal agents busted an \u201cultraexclusive, high-stakes, illegal poker ring\u201d run by Russian gangsters out of Trump Tower. In addition to card games, they operated illegal gambling websites, ran a global sports book and laundered more than $100 million. A condo directly below one owned by Trump reportedly served as HQ for a \u201csophisticated money-laundering scheme\u201d connected to Semion Mogilevich. \n\n\u25ba It has been widely known for decades that Russia often used videotaped \"honey traps\" to compromise influential visitors. General Oleg Kalugin, former head of counterintelligence for the KGB, told Craig Unger (Author, \"House of Trump, House of Putin\") they probably did this with Trump during his visit to Russia in 1987--long before the events in the Steele dossier. \"I can't tell what is inside Trump's mind, but everyone who traveled to Russia knew this.\"\n\n\u25ba  Rudy Giuliani famously prosecuted the Italian mob while he was a federal prosecutor, yet the Russian mob was allowed to thrive under his tenure in the Southern District and Mayor. And now he's deeply entwined in the business of Trump and Russian oligarchs. Giuiani appointed Semyon Kislin to the NYC Economic Development Council in 1990, and the FBI described Kislin as having ties tot he Russian mob. Of course, it made good political sense for Giuliani to get headlines for smashing the Italian mob.\n\n\u25ba A lot of Republicans in Washington are implicated. Boatloads of Russian money went to the GOP--often in legal ways. The NRA got as much as $70M [from Russia](https://newrepublic.com/minutes/148961/evidence-emerges-nras-russia-connection), then funneled it to the GOP. The Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee lead by McConnel got millions from Leonard Blavatnik. The big white shoe law firms--Jones Day, for example-- represent powerful Russian oligarchs who have billions and billions of dollars. Much of this is legal even though it appears to have compromised huge parts of the GOP. Unger's book alleges that most of the GOP leadership has been compromised by RU money. In the 90s, the Russians began sending money to top GOP leaders, like Speaker of the House Tom Delay. \n\n\u25ba At the Cityscape USA\u2019s Bridging US and the Emerging Real Estate Markets Conference held in Manhattan, on September 9, 10, and 11, 2008, Trump Jr. was frank about the tide of Russian money supporting the family business, saying \"...And in terms of high-end product influx into the US, Russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets.\" \n\n\u25ba Eric Trump told James Dodson, a golf reporter, in 2014 that the Trump Organization was able to expand during the financial crisis because \u201cWe don\u2019t rely on American banks. We have all the funding we need out of Russia.\u201d\n\n\u25ba Trump's first wife, Ivana, was under surveillance by the STB, the Czech secret police, and they reported to the KGB. Ivana got out of Communist Czechoslovakia in the 70s which was not easy to do.\n\n\u25ba Regarding the Steele dossier, while not everything in the dossier has been corroborated, some of it has and none of it has been disproven. Christopher Steele has a terrific reputation in the intelligence world. For reference, Jeb Bush's opposition research included paying a US based intelligence firm (GPS Fusion), who reached out to Steele. This same intelligence firm was later hired by Clinton during her campaign. All of this was above-board and verifiable. \n\n\u25ba At the end of 2018, Putin and his allies started making a [strong push](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2018/12/04/defying-history-moscow-moves-defend-soviet-war-afghanistan/?utm_term=.d077fc6cf274) for a resolution that would justify their country\u2019s 1979 invasion and reverse an 1989 vote backed by Mikhail Gorbachev that condemned it. The Putinists\u2019 goal was to pass the resolution by Feb. There is no one on this side of the Atlantic who thinks the USSR was justified in invading Afghanistan. And out of nowhere, on [January 2nd](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-cracked-afghan-history-11546560234), Trump came out strongly supporting Russia's 1979 invasion of Afghanistan.\n\n\u25ba We don't know who may be prosecuted with Deutsche Bank, but Russian money laundering is a huge part of this and how they compromised Trump. Trump was $4 billion in debt and the Russians [bailed him out](https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/12/21/how-russian-money-helped-save-trumps-business/).

But the president\u2019s activities before and after Mr. Comey\u2019s firing in May 2017, particularly two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the Comey dismissal to the Russia investigation, helped prompt the counterintelligence aspect of the inquiry, the people said.\n\n>The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, took over the inquiry into Mr. Trump when he was appointed, days after F.B.I. officials opened it. \n\n-\n\n>The criminal and counterintelligence elements were coupled together into one investigation, former law enforcement officials said in interviews in recent weeks, because if Mr. Trump had ousted the head of the F.B.I. to impede or even end the Russia investigation, that was both a possible crime and a national security concern. The F.B.I.\u2019s counterintelligence division handles national security matters.\n\n>If the president had fired Mr. Comey to stop the Russia investigation, the action would have been a national security issue because it naturally would have hurt the bureau\u2019s effort to learn how Moscow interfered in the 2016 election and whether any Americans were involved, according to James A.

Unlike criminal investigations, which are typically aimed at solving a crime and can result in arrests and convictions, counterintelligence inquiries are generally fact-finding missions to understand what a foreign power is doing and to stop any anti-American activity, like thefts of United States government secrets or covert efforts to influence policy. In most cases, the investigations are carried out quietly, sometimes for years. Often, they result in no arrests.\n\n>Mr. Trump had caught the attention of F.B.I. counterintelligence agents when he called on Russia during a campaign news conference in July 2016 to hack into the emails of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Mr. Trump had refused to criticize Russia on the campaign trail, praising President Vladimir V. Putin. And investigators had watched with alarm as the Republican Party softened its convention platform on the Ukraine crisis in a way that seemed to benefit Russia.\n\n-\n\n>But law enforcement officials put off the decision to open the investigation until they had learned more, according to people familiar with their thinking. As for a counterintelligence inquiry, they concluded that they would need strong evidence to take the sensitive step of investigating the president, and they were also concerned that the existence of such an inquiry could be leaked to the news media, undermining the entire investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the election.\n\n>After Mr. Comey was fired on May 9, 2017, two more of Mr. Trump\u2019s actions prompted them to quickly abandon those reservations.\n\n>The first was a letter Mr. Trump wanted to send to Mr. Comey about his firing, but never did, in which he mentioned the Russia investigation.

With assistance from the KGB. It took place while Kryuchkov was seeking to improve the KGB's operational techniques in one particular and sensitive area. The spy chief wanted KGB staff abroad to recruit more Americans. \n\n&nbsp;\n\n>One solution was to make wider use of \u201cthe facilities of friendly intelligence services\u201d\u2014for example, Czechoslovakian or East German spy networks.\nAnd: \u201cFurther improvement in operational work with agents calls for fuller and wider utilisation of confidential and special unofficial contacts.

She was therefore of interest both to the Czech intelligence service, the StB, and to the FBI and CIA.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n>According to files in Prague, declassified in 2016, Czech spies kept a close eye on the couple in Manhattan. (The agents who undertook this task were code-named Al Jarza and Lubos.) They opened letters sent home by Ivana to her father, Milos, an engineer. Milos was never an agent or asset. But he had a functional relationship with the Czech secret police, who would ask him how his daughter was doing abroad and in return permit her visits home. There was periodic surveillance of the Trump family in the United States.

It's just another con-job to steal taxpayer money and hand it off to his contractor/construction buddies who will get paid fat stacks of cash to make a useless wall that will have no impact on the problem it states it will address.\n\n3. [\"We Do Not Want Most Employees To Return\"](https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/senior-trump-official-anonymous-daily-caller-op-ed-shutdown-federal-workers). This is starve the beast in overdrive. The GOP is waiting out federal employees until they start to quit/leave for other work to survive so they can further crush and dismantle the government without having to do it legislatively. They are actively staging a fucking coup to privatize everything they can and dismantle everything else they can in order to crush the government's capacity for regulation and to profit off of all the services it use to provide.\n\n4. Republicans are stuck. If they oppose Trump, they piss off the loyal cultists he still has. But by sticking to him, they piss off everyone else. They'e fucked no matter what and too scared to move in any direction because they're too cowardly to rip the bandaid off a problem they created and have to own.  I also personally believe the party itself is complicit in Trump's illegal activities with Russia and are shielding him to shield themselves.\n\n5. What you just said is an interesting addition, though considering Schumer can force a vote on the sanctions I do wonder if it's just a happy accident or intentional. I wouldn't down for a second it being intentional, but would it be worth the effort when there was a way to bypass the move? Trump certainly isn't smart, so who knows.\n\n6. A theory I had, but which is increasingly feeling less and less likely: that the shutdown is being allowed to bleed off support for Trump so he's easier to impeach/remove from office when the time comes. He's caused immense damage to the economy and is more trouble than he's worth, and it considering the Democrats have held on this shutdown (something they usually cave on), my assumption was their donors were telling them it was okay; let it happen, carve into his numbers, and lets be rid of him as we've used him as much as we can to get tax cuts and gut regulatory bodies. But, considering a lot of the other elements coming out about this shutdown, I'm beginning to greatly question if that speculation holds much water anymore.
