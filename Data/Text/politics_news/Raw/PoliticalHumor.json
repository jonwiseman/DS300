I really think the focus needs to shift at this point to the broader picture of *why* these exist.\n\nI think people are missing the forest for the trees sometimes when it comes to policing and minority relations. So much focus and emphasis is placed on individual officers and singular events when the real problems are so systemic and far reaching that change just isn\u2019t going to come from the beat cop alone.\n\nI spent time in law enforcement and left for my own ideological reasons. I hated it for many reasons but the power imbalance always made\nme uncomfortable (but that was my own issue). But I also know what the job entails and know that the way it is often portrayed and what people expect is unrealistic given the *current* circumstances. Change 100% needs to happen.\n\nBut I\u2019ve heard these suggestion/ theory\u2019s/ accusations thrown out there and I don\u2019t think they have merit (without trying to make a straw man here):\nPolice officers unfairly target low income communities: It just isn\u2019t true. The individual patrol officer is looking for crime/ responding to crime and the needs of the community. Time and time again, when police pull back from communities plagued by crime for budgetary reasons or staffing reasons, there is an outcry as to why these low income communities are lacking coverage.\n\nCops are using force unlawfully and disproportionately on people based *strictly* on their skin color: Again, this is a muddy and complicated issue that you can\u2019t really understand unless you\u2019ve been on patrol. A constant state of hyper arousal exists when working, and when engaged in an altercation with  someone, instinct takes over. Bad shoots have absolutely happened and are reprehensible. Those cops should be charged with murder and put away. The examples that come to mind are Tamir Rice and Walter Scott shootings. There is zero, and I mean zero excuse for either of those murders. But when you look at the Mike Brown, or even the Laquan McDonald shootings you can find more to the stories.\n\n\nWhen it comes down to it, African Americans, for some really fucked up socioeconomic reasons stemming from Jim Crow and Institutional Racism, are more likely to have encounters with police. Following that logic, it makes sense as to why they account for 43% of felonious homicides on police while representing 12% of the population. A mutual distrust exists on both sides. It\u2019s complex, and stems from more than just cops going out, pulling over black people, planting crack on them, and throwing them in jail. We have more police accountability than ever before, and the trend continues in that direction because of the calls for accountability. But the focus needs to shift.  Louisiana cops aren\u2019t going to stop locking people up for stupid crimes unless Louisiana judges stop sending people to prison for stupid crimes at the behest of the private prison lobby. Crime won\u2019t be the only option for disenfranchised minorities unless we decide as a society to assist those in a meaningful way to escape the cycle of poverty and criminality. Migrants won\u2019t need to resort to illegal tactics to cross the border if there is a more accessible path to immigrate. And police officers won\u2019t stop patrolling high crime areas until there is no high crime areas.

And rather than having you go back to the hive and use this as an example of librul bashing of your chosen one I'll clarify a bit.  No I do not literally think he is saying he cured HIV.  But I also don't think this is all sunshine and lollipops.  Trump is all about scoring political points.  He's been clear about that and his desire to punish those who cross him.  His use of the NYT here is intentional and has meaning.  He has consistently called it 'failing' and 'fake news'.  Do you think he now finds it a totally reputable source worth citing?  Do you think it is?  In this case, the NYT had at least one article that said something negative about his desire to cut AIDS research involving fetal tissue including how many might die without such funding.  In this tweet he is pointing out to, rather than actually citing, the NYT that there are amazing breakthroughs using procedures that don't rely on fetal tissue.  Beyond that, and the reason I embellished into what I did, it is entirely reasonable to think that he thinks his threat to cut funding (I'm not sure what actually became of it) inspired others to look to new ways to find cures thereby making him in some way responsible for said new cures even though they were in the works long before he became POTUS.  Yes, that is taking a bit of creative license on my part.  But I'm sure he is including himself in the 'so many for whom this is great news' as it proves wrong anyone who says fetal tissue is necessary to find a cure for HIV.  In other words, he's saying 'See, NYT, you were wrong in saying that not using fetal tissue would hinder the development of a cure for HIV and risk millions of lives.  This is great news because it means I was right.'  \n  \nFor those still on the fluffy dog bandwagon, why did he include the NYT when he isn't even linking an article?"}, {"comment_id": "ehvlxb5", "post_id": "axqhv2", "comment": "Exactly.

I'm not talking modest stuff, he has 5 mansions worth 10+ million each, etc. The issue I have with when you accumulate too much money (say 10+ million) is you simply stop spending time with the stuff you own. Like how often do you think he actually uses all of his mansions and every room see's use? How often does Leno or Seinfeld actually  spend time with each of their cars (not specifically driving, as many are museum  quality)? If Musk wanted to build a space station and live on it 24/7, it would be insane and the most lavish thing ever, but that would be another story.

The first is one of utility. Past a certain point, money tends to have diminishing returns on standard of living- the increase in standard living from 50 to 51 million in net worth is marginal compared to increase seen if the million were say, used to fund public works. You may argue that the money made by the rich is not sitting in the bank, rich people invest their money and therefore help stimulate the economy. This is true, however, investment into things like public works, result in little profit and therefore get ignored by private investment. Many government investment projects are inherently unprofitable but still better society so we need ways to fund them. \n\nI usually find utilitarian arguments to be unconvincing, so here's one that relies more on a concept of justice. It's too much work to summarize in a Reddit post, but John Rawls, an incredibly influential philosopher argues that there are number of principles of justice that would be mutually agreed upon if everyone where equal with respect to their original life circumstances. The difference principle is one such principle. If you've ever read or are familiar with Kant and his work in morality, it shouldn't be too hard to understand.\n https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Justice_as_Fairness#Difference_Principle\n\nLet me know if you have questions."}, {"comment_id": "f03tg1f", "post_id": "d3h4vd", "comment": "The amount of wealth we're talking about here is crazy.

In the same sense, the wealthier you are, the more you pay in, because you can afford it.\n\nThe ability to afford it is the key here. If you have \"fuck-you-money\" before taxation, chances are you will still have extreme wealth after taxation. It does not impact your day to day quality of life or any reasonable personal financial investments you want to make. You still get to enjoy the fruits of your labor.\n\nOn a side note, taxes pay for better infrastructure, social programs, security and other factors that enhance a nation's overall quality of life.

There are people that own more than the human mind can adequately put into perspective.

Government funds work to protect patents that businesses such as pharmaceutical companies require for them to profit.  \n\nBillionaires that run companies require a workforce that can get to work via roads or public transportation so it is their interest to keep those things running.  They require workers to be healthy, so it is in their best interest for them to help fund healthcare initiatives.  They require workers that are educated for many positions so it is in their best interest that schools are doing their jobs.\n\nKeep in mind this only applies to about half of billionaires as about 57% of billionaires are self-made, quite a lot of them simply inherit.

Force Bezos to extract wealth through normal pay, but ensure he doesn't lose control of the company to activist investors. \n\nOR, even better, IMHO, outlaw public companies where one group or individual owns more than 25% or 10% for tiered companies. There are serious cons to that, but a public company, like Amazon or FB isn't publicly owned if one individual can overrule everyone else. Hell, you could even mandate public companies be 20% employee owned at a minimum, or have a 1% stock transfer to employee per year plan or whatever.\n\n\nThe problem of wildly high wealth inequality is directly tied to the best and smartest companies in a new economy being created yesterday and becoming the biggest and most dominant today being owned by one person. \n\n\nAnd yes, I know that voting and non voting shares exist today.
