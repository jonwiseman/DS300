Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg\n\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nJames B. Comey, James R. Clapper Jr. and John O. Brennan at a Senate hearing on Russia\u2019s election interference in January 2017.CreditAl Drago/The New York Times\n\nBy\u00a0David E. Sanger\u00a0and\u00a0Matthew Rosenberg\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.\n\nThe evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.\n\nMr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.\n\nThe shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.\n\nOn Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.\n\nOn Wednesday, when a reporter asked, \u201cIs Russia still targeting the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Trump shot back, \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)\n\nHours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, \u201cbecause he\u2019s in charge of the country.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to this week\u2019s ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.\n\nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the \u201cSteele dossier.\u201d That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump\u2019s activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.\n\nAccording to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin\u2019s role in the election interference.\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, the day he was briefed on cyberattacks designed to sway the 2016 American election.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times\n\nThey included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the\u00a0Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U.\u00a0had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.\n\nAnd ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin\u2019s own role.\n\nThat included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.\n\nInstead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.\n\nThe same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called \u201chand-to-hand combat\u201d to dig in.\n\nThe pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.\n\nAfter the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said \u201cRussia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries\u201d were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations \u2014 including the D.N.C.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump said in his statement, \u201cthere was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d\n\nMr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.\n\n\u201cI was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,\u201d he said in testimony in May 2017. \u201cAnd they were very aggressive.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.\n\nMr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss in the election.\n\nMr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia\u2019s election interference.\n\nOnly Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)\n\nPresident Trump, meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAnd the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.\n\nIn March, the Department of Homeland Security\u00a0declared that Russia was\u00a0targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.\n\nJust last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were \u201cblinking red\u201d and called Russia the \u201cmost aggressive foreign actor, no question.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nChristopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm.\n\n\u201cThe intelligence community\u2019s assessment has not changed,\u201d Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. \u201cMy view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.\u201d\n\nThe Russian efforts are \u201caimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.\u201d\n\nAlmost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia\u2019s election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.\n\nHe dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia\u2019s role \u2014 and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump\u2019s immediate orbit may have worked with them.\n\nIn July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow\u2019s cyberskills were so good that the government\u2019s hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.\n\nSince then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure \u2014 as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday \u2014 he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.\n\nThat is what happened again this week, twice.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.\n\nThat contributed to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered \u2014 although he also veered off script to declare: \u201cCould be other people also. A lot of people out there.\u201d\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "e2n7bw7", "post_id": "901p5f", "comment": "Okay, but **what do we do?**"}, {"comment_id": "e2n481x", "post_id": "901p5f", "comment": "Trump is the President, he's had access to all the top secret information and proof of what Russia has done this whole time.

The thugs tied up the security guards, doused them in gasoline, lit a match and threatened to set them afire unless they opened the warehouse\u2019s vault. Inside, the thieves found nearly 7,000 gold bars, diamonds and cash.\n\n\u201cThanks ever so much for your help. Have a nice Christmas,\u201d one of the crooks said as they departed.\n\nBritish media dubbed the heist the \u201cCrime of the Century.\u201d Much of the loot - including the cash reaped by melting the gold and selling it - was never recovered. Where the missing money went is a mystery that continues to fascinate students of England\u2019s underworld.\n\nNow documents within Mossack Fonseca\u2019s files reveal that the law firm and its co-founder, J\u00fcrgen Mossack, may have helped the conspirators keep the spoils out of the hands of authorities by protecting a company tied to Gordon Parry, a London wheeler-dealer who laundered money for the Brink\u2019s-Mat plotters.\n\n On Feb. 10, 2011, an anonymous company in the British Virgin Islands named Sandalwood Continental Ltd. loaned $200 million to an equally shadowy firm based in Cyprus called Horwich Trading Ltd.\n\nThe following day, Sandalwood assigned the rights to collect payments on the loan - including interest - to Ove Financial Corp., a mysterious company in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nFor those rights, Ove paid $1.\n\nBut the money trail didn\u2019t end there.\n\nThe same day, Ove reassigned its rights to collect on the loan to a Panama company called International Media Overseas.\n\nIt too paid $1.\n\nIn the space of 24 hours the loan had, on paper, traversed three countries, two banks and four companies, making the money all but untraceable in the process.\n\nFamily members of at least eight current or former members of China\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee, the country\u2019s main ruling body, have offshore companies arranged though Mossack Fonseca. They include President Xi\u2019s brother-in-law, who set up two British Virgin Islands companies in 2009.\n\nThe leaked files show the firm regularly offered to backdate documents to help its clients gain advantage in their financial affairs. It was so common that in 2007 an email exchange shows firm employees talking about establishing a price structure - clients would pay $8.75 for each month farther back in time that a corporate document would be backdated.\n\nThe world\u2019s best soccer player, Lionel Messi, is also found in the documents. The records show Messi and his father were owners of a Panama company: Mega Star Enterprises Inc. This adds a new name to the list of shell companies known to be linked to Messi.

Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can \"spend\" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.\n\n*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons!

I've lived in places in the middle east where the internet was not free and open. Where access was granted and denied at the whim of other people and you know what? It's fucking awful.\n\nNow, the scope of what I am talking about is in many ways different from what the FCC is talking about here. It's not nearly as bad, however, I feel like there are some relevant crossovers to mention.\n\nFirst of all, since there were no laws or policies in place to protect the customer, internet companies could basically do whatever the hell they wanted. Do you know why? Because they are basically owned by the state they operate in. 68% of Ooredoo is owned by the state of Qatar, Etisalat; the 14th largest mobile network operator in the world 60% of it owned by the UAE. So here is some shit they can pull. And this isn't just a problem in the middle eastern gulf, this happens in all kinds of places in the middle east that do not necessarily practise censorship.\n\nFirst of all, they absolutely throttle your access to certain online services. For example, teamspeak. This is such a thing in certain countries it is hilarious. Teamspeak is a VOIP application for gamers yet for whatever reason, there are certain places where you just cannot use it. You will find yourself being throttled for the seemingly most random things and you will never know why. This is literally the kind of thing net neutrality protects us all from. Your ISP doesn't like the fact that a lot of people are using discord or netflix for example? Throttle the shit out of it or charge a shit ton of money. Oh this is the best one. ETISALAT LITERALLY BLOCKS MESSENGER, VIBER AND ALL OTHER VOIP SERVICES. Why? So that people can only use their own mobile network to call overseas. It is literally the most annoying thing ever. I cannot call my family in the UAE on messenger or any of those services because it is literally blocked so that they have to pay money to call on the regular phone network. What is to stop companies like Verizon or Comcast from doing this??\n\nCensorship. Now yes, nothing about this FCC decision will come into the realm of censorship eh? But how can you be so sure? The fact that companies like ooreedoo and etisilat are primarily owned by the state, means that they have blocked all immoral content; porn websites, hell even things that aren't even porn but have someone dressed in a lewd manner. They have blocked any site that critiques their governments, sexual health resources for pete's sake, dating services etc.\n\nWill there ever come a day where now that net neutrality has been done away with where partisan congress members can push for the restriction of sexual health services for example because it goes against their ideals? I mean what is to say that there won't be any collusion between government representatives and internet providers over the semantics of what is subject to heavier prices, access or restrictions?\n\nThis is of course assuming the worst, but we cannot pretend that people will not try to use this to their advantage. Not to mention that this pigeon holes people's free access to so many things. Let's say I am writing a paper for school and reach my limit for a certain database, website or whatever it may be. Then what? Am I supposed to move on to more sanctioned resources that I will have longer access to? Why? Why can't I just use what I want. What if I am an alcoholic and I come to reddit everyday because I am part of a support community. What will happen once I cannot come back here to talk to my community and I cannot afford to \"unlock reddit\".\n\nI try my best to see any redeeming qualities of doing away with net neutrality but I have already experienced the very bare minimum of it minus the censorship and it actually fucking sucks.\n\nI am so thankful and privileged to have become a Canadian and to now be living in Canada. Sometimes we cannot really visualise just exactly how good we have it until we experience it about 1000 times worse.

The danger of the mayority of the people supporting that is low.\nHowever there are more things that can be done without proper net neutrality. In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!\nIt sounds great but;\n1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!\n2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.\n3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.\n\nNet neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around. Collateral damage would include a ban on VPN services.\n \nSo yeah having a good Net Neutrality law is a must but stopping Net Neutrality law is much easier with free candy for consumers.

I have always been proud to be an American citizen, with our flaws and our strengths. This last year has been a shameful nightmare for the American people. The people in power and influence aren't even trying to be discreet with their selfish ambitions, and its the voters and citizens who will suffer for the benefit of someone else.\n\nNet Neutrality is not some evil scheme by the Democrats; Obama is not some sort of supervillain whose wake of terror and malice has to be repealed and cleaned up. The diversity between the two major political parties in this country is worse than ever. Politicians don't care to better this country for all, they only care about their team having the most points. It's a disgusting way to live and it hurts all of us. This current issue is only the most recent disgrace to come to the attention of Congress to pass through. There is no advantage to giving a handful of major ISP companies the right to extort money for access to the internet. There are countries that have free internet service and there are countries that consider internet access a basic human right these days. The United States won't even consider water a basic human necessity, for the sake of a company that won't spare any expense to make more money.\n\nRepealing Net Neutrality is just handing the keys to a daycare center to a famously aggressive and unsympathetic bully. These bullies want more control, more money, and they don't care who they have to harm to get it. The fact that multiple, countless fake identities were made to spread false information to promote the repealing of Net Neutrality should indicate that this is an evil, amoral and twisted idea that even its promoters are aware of. If this was good for the the people of this country at all, there would be actual support of it.\n\nI am so ashamed to have to live in a country where the people are going unheard, and blatantly self-serving laws are being passed. Net Neutrality is one idea that was already voted against, and here we are again, begging and pleading for some rational thought and compassion to find the hearts of the people that determine the fate of this country that we all live in.\n\nAre we citizens of this country, or are we marks for companies to take for all we have? Net Neutrality isn't even the beginning, but with every selfish law being passed that puts the boot to the necks of the citizens, we find ourselves inching closer to the end. This once great country may not even survive another ten years. I can barely see the light of hope in the darkness that grows greater every day.\n\nIf this law passes, and we the people are subject to the whims of a few greedy businesses, you may as well change \u201cWe the People\u201d to \u201cWe the Corporations.\u201d\n\nFor the love of decency, for the sake of a brighter future, for the chance that future generations may transform our country into a great nation once again, I beg you to see reason. Net Neutrality must not be repealed. Make me, and others, proud to be American citizens once again.\n\nOur current president vowed to make America great again.

I didn't bother spell-checking too much.\n\n>Dear Congressmen.\n\nI write to you deeply concerned as a politically inactive person. But you have finally managed to activate me. Congratulations. Your recent proposal to deregulate and repeal \"Net-neutrality\" has left me questioning whether your fully comprehend the magnitude and responsibility of the office which you possess.\n\nThe Internet has been developed from being a secondary medium for search and information in its earlier days to being the far way foremost medium and source for information / communication. \nThe free flow of information and the right to freely share knowledge / information is paramount to every society. It connects to both freedom of speech which is already fundamentally secured in the constitution but also to the mutual trust we each have in society as a whole. Trust is the oil of the engine that is the economy. Without it, I may hesitate and abstain from making a certain transaction thus promoting inertia in the economy. Trust is built by relations, communication, information, accountability and a well-functioning (and somewhat fast) justice system. Prohibiting the free flow of information simply put, limits trust. In essence, you are transferring the right to a free flow of information as a law/constitutional right to instead being chosen by companies. However as is evident in several recent leaks of tax havens and WikiLeaks, the interest of companies may deeply conflict with the interest of the common good. \n\nYou may be right, that nothing may happen when you require the corporations to report their policies. But you may also be very wrong. As a technically educated person I can safely say that many things can be done, hidden beneath heaps of code, that are extremely hard to reveal/check without compromising intellectual property. It would essentially require them to supply their whole code-base for checking which would be prone to theft of intellectual property. That would be neither be satisfactory for the consumer nor the corporation. \n\nIf it is your intention to rely solely on the good intentions of large internet providers and not check their codebase in it's entirety then history through many examples across a variety of industries that this approach is frankly naive. As elected member of the US Congress you are guardians of the Constitution, lawmakers and protectors of the people.

I ***firmly*** believe that the only reason this is uncertain at all is because the law hasn't kept up.

I just want to pay for a desired item, not a chance at the item. \n\nI'm secretly glad EA gets to bear the brunt of it, Star Wars could be such a fun and accessible IP, it feels like the developers haven't even played the original Battlefront 2 (do young gamers even know that this is a severely-restricted reboot?). Twelve years ago at launch I popped in a disc and was able to play on countless maps as over a dozen heroes, space battles included such technological feats as barrel-rolls and docking in enemy frigates to fight on foot. Nothing was locked behind in-game currency or random chance rewards and this game still held my attention for years and years on good gameplay alone. The corruption of modern AAA gaming needs more exposure. Gamers aren't making the video games anymore.

I would say Reddit to the rescue once again, but I sort of have to agree with the judge on this. Even though it's not likely, it may be a welcome change.

Now, I am not deleting my facebook account. Facebook is a tool that I like.\n\nI am on my alternate account, and the reason is, I am kind of \"in industry\". I work with clients who use facebook and other tools to advertise.\n\nIt's important to note that this plugin doesn't really solve the whole \"Cambridge Analytica\" thing. That cat is already out of the bag. That data is out there. There was a great article on the atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/arch that kind of explained what happened there. Essentially, back in the the early facebook days, they were trying to establish an ecosystem of apps. These were things like iq tests,games, etc, but also included things like registering for a third party website. When you installed one of those apps, you gave facebook permission to give that 3rd party your information. Once it was given, there is no way to get it back.That was things like your school, your contact information and your friends. When facebook transitioned to mobile first, that \"installing apps\" thing kind of stopped. The extension does nothing to solve this problem.\n\nNow, there is another dimension, which is facebook tracking on pages that aren't facebook. This used to be commonly done with \"share on facebook buttons\". Now, it's a lot less transparent. It is very commonly set up so that when you visit a site, facebook knows. Then, someone can target you with an ad on facebook based on that information. For example, you go to a tee-shirt store. You don't buy the tee shirt. And, then you go on facebook and see an ad for that teeshirt. I believe this is what the plugin is designed to solve.\n\nAnother thing that facebook does is it takes lists from other people. You load the lists in, and then facebook can do a few things. It can serve ads to those people. But, it can also find people who are similar to those people. And then it can serve ads based on either of those. So in the t-shirt example, if someone visits the store and makes a purchase. You can take a list of all those people, load it into facebook and find other people who look similar. Then, serve ads to those people. This extension does nothing to fix this. \n\nMost of the actual advertising that is done with facebook is actually on one of their properties (basically instagram and facebook). I believe that facebook has some ability to serve ads off facebook, but I have actually heard very little about it. Theoretically, this extension would help, but Google really dominates that market. So, this would be a drop in the bucket. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dwdyvoq", "post_id": "87icwb", "comment": "I find it hilarious Facebook is officially being treated as malware needing containment...which it basically is."}, {"comment_id": "dwe0c3t", "post_id": "87icwb", "comment": "Well sorry chrome, looks like I\u2019m switching to the fox "}, {"comment_id": "dwe0pyf", "post_id": "87icwb", "comment": "So current setup is now \n\n- uBlock origin\n\n- EFF Privacy Badger\n\n- Decentraleyes\n\n- Firefox Containers\n\n- Canvas Defender\n\nJesus fuck, cant someone just make a firefox fork with all of this in natively?

This technique only works if T cells are already infiltrated into a tumor large enough to be injected - T cells are very bad at getting into solid tumors, largely because tumors tend to rapidly evolve mechanisms to specifically prevent this from happening. Frankly, if the T cells were able to get into the tumor in the first place, there are probably enough neoantigens there that this injection is not even necessary. [Studies](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4794755/) have been done in other resistant cancers and there's a significant survival benefit from just getting the relevant cells there in the first place, which is a step that this study neglects to address.\n2. Mouse cancer models are generally terrible. The authors here are arguing that their treatment works well when the tumors are implanted and then treated (the A20 model). This does not reflect actual cancer development, since the cancer doesn't pop up in the relevant context of an active immune system (i.e. cancer is grown in a dish then put in, it is much more sensitive to enhanced host immune responses since it never learned how to cope with the baseline host immune system while it was evolving).\n3. From the paper itself: \"We have developed a practical strategy for immunotherapy of cancer. It takes advantage of the preexisting T cell immune repertoire within the tumor microenvironment.\" Practically there is often no preexisting T cell immune repertoire within tumor microenvironments. These cells have been suppressed already.\n4. On a more practical level, if this was a serious breakthrough it would have been published in Science proper instead of in one of its offshoots.\n\nSource - PhD in Microbiology and Immunology"}, {"comment_id": "dtk4396", "post_id": "7ug4pb", "comment": "My fear is that when a cure for cancer is finally found, it will become privatized and cost a fortune.

This is because dirty coal produces sulfates which cloud the atmosphere and act as a sunscreen. This sunscreen has prevented the level of warming we **should** have seen by now, but have avoided (kinda, keep reading). [Here\u2019s good example of this on a smaller scale:]( https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610007/were-about-to-kill-a-massive-accidental-experiment-in-halting-global-warming/)\n>In effect, the shipping industry has been carrying out an unintentional experiment in climate engineering for more than a century.

We simply kick the can down the road with these emissions. The warming is still there waiting, until the moment we no longer emit these sulfates. * [Just 35% reduction in industrial output(emissions) would lead to 1C temperature rise](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/jgrd.50192).

[Methane](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-bad-of-a-greenhouse-gas-is-methane/), which works on scales of hundreds of years instead of thousands(but is much more effective at heating), will be released more and more on large swaths of land as time goes on. \n\nOther feedback loops include deforestation and albedo effects, [melting ice caps](https://nas-sites.org/americasclimatechoices/more-resources-on-climate-change/climate-change-lines-of-evidence-booklet/evidence-impacts-and-choices-figure-gallery/figure-9/), and [increasing water vapor](https://phys.org/news/2014-07-vapor-global-amplifier.html) which will only amplify the damage that has already been done.\n\nThink about that: If we did the impossible and switched entirely to 100%, zero-emission, fictional renewables today and provided zero carbon footprint... We'd *still be in dire conditions for generations to come.*\n\nFrom a wildlife standpoint - even more grim news.\nEvery animal on the planet is dropping.  [Recent studies](http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-37775622) estimate 58% of all wildlife has died since 1970. The U.N. has warned [1 million species are at risk of extinction](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/2019/05/ipbes-un-biodiversity-report-warns-one-million-species-at-risk/).  We are in an extinction event that is [*ten to one-hundred times*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocene_extinction) the rate of any other extinction on Earth, save the giant impact event.  It seems like hyperbole, but it isn't.  We are currently undergoing (at least) the second-fastest extinction in the planet's history.\n\nClimate-deniers like to call people like me who agree with the global consensus of scientists \"alarmists.\" You're fucking right I'm an alarmist.

I have been organising strikes for half a year now and this is one of the biggest public misconceptions of climate crisis:\n\n\u201eI\u2019m terrified, but what can I do?\u201c, many here are asking. The answer: A lot. But not the way they tell you. \n\nI mean, obviously: stop using plastic straws won\u2018t make it. \nHowever, even if you live car-free, eat a plant-based diet and choose trains over flights: This is not enough.\n\nYou can cut an estimated 1/3 of your emissions by individual action. The rest of it is structural. Public infrastructure, the food system, international trade and transportation is nothing you can change at an individual level. \nAdditionally, 71% of emissions are emitted by the 100 most polluting companys. You can\u2018t change them by individual action either.\n\nIt is a system that is wrong. And it\u2018s biggest success has been to make you believe that there\u2018s only YOU to blame. \n\nBut as we race to reduce our carbon footprint by individual action, they are making sure that this is a race we\u2018ll never win. They - big oil companies & the rest of the fossil fuel industry - have an enormous amount of influence in our governments. Not only the Trump administration is highly corrupted - for example, in Switzerland, our biggest party\u2019s president is also president of the biggest oil-lobby group. \n\nThe scientific consensus is clear: climate emergency has become of such a dramatic scale that only radical and immediate action from our governments can prevent the worst. \n\nInstead, politicians talk about everlasting growth and distract the public with minor or made-up issues (Muslims will be the death of western civilisation!). \n\nIt\u2019s pretty clear: They have failed us. They will fail us again. They won\u2018t protect us from climate breakdown. \n\nWell, here comes what you can do: Get your ass up.

If you\u2019d rather everyone give up, sure, keep posting about those 100 companies making all those emissions (even though emissions aren\u2019t the only problem). If you want to make a positive difference in the world, encourage others to do something to help. If everyone does some of these, it will make a tangible difference. \n\nI wrote this in a sub thread but I\u2019m making it its own comment. Please suggest any additional ideas you have, I\u2019ll edit and add them (as well as any others I think of)! \n\nHere are some things you can do personally to help the environment: \n\n1) one of the most important things you can do is VOTE! Vote for people who care about the environment, and get your friends to do so too. \n\n2) donate money to research, climate change initiatives, wildlife funds, and girls\u2019 education\n\n3) yes, get an degree in ecology/sustainability/environmental engineering/wildlife biology (and I\u2019m happy to answer any questions about wildlife biology specifically\u2014it\u2019s so important so I gotta plug it!) \n\n4) LOBBY! [Here\u2019s](https://citizensclimatelobby.org/join-citizens-climate-lobby/?tfa_3590416195188=reddit-CarbonTax&utm_campaign=CarbonTax&utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app) one place to start, happy to add links to others if people want to share some! \n\nThings you and anyone can do that are on a smaller scale (which will have a greater impact if you tell others about it and encourage them to do these too): \n\n1) eat less meat. Specifically less red meat. Same goes for other animal products. You don\u2019t need to go full on vegan, but reduction is important. And there are a ton of really good meat and dairy substitutes now\u2014I personally highly recommend Gardein (in the frozen section), as well as beyond meat and impossible burgers. Ripple milk is also great! \n\n1a) following that, if you do still eat meat, dont eat free range. Takes up way more land and water. Backyard chickens are fine \n\n2) keep your cats inside, and bring feral cats to the shelter. They\u2019re invasive species and responsible for 63 extinctions and counting. TNR doesn\u2019t work. \n\n3) choose walking, biking, and public transportation over driving \n\n4) reduce, reuse, THEN recycle. We need to buy fewer things (especially electronics). A lot of things can be bought as reusables, including batteries\u2014check those out!\n\n5) ethical ecotourism (and no cruises!)\n\n6) compost \n\n7) support GMOs, most are specifically  engineered to be more efficient \n\n8) plant only native plants, and get rid of non-native plants. This will help pollinators, and bonus is it\u2019s way easier to maintain! Also consider building bee houses if you have room. \n\n9) buy less single use plastic. Recycling is like a bandaid on an enormous dam about to burst\u2014it\u2019s really not doing much but it\u2019s better than nothing. \n\n10) call out companies and businesses that do shitty things on social media and via call centers. This includes using unsustainable ingredients, not recycling, using ridiculous amounts of plastic, etc \n\n11) don\u2019t litter (and cigarette butts are plastic litter), which should be obvious \n\n12) only adopt domesticated animals as pets (I\u2019m counting mice and rats and guinea pigs as domesticated jsuk), and if you want an exotic only rescue them. The illegal wildlife trade is the third largest black market in the world, and is destroying wild populations of animals. Even if your specific pet is from a captive breeder (spoiler alert, still a good possibility it was wild caught or is otherwise unsustainable), people will see pics of it online and want one, and may not be as responsible. Furthermore, don\u2019t support \u201ccute\u201d vids of people playing with wild animal pets online. Every wild animal, and especially the ones that are cool \u201cpets\u201d, fill an important role in their ecosystem, and all of these things just further encourage poaching. Happy to talk more about this point as it\u2019s more of my specialty (I\u2019m a wildlife biologist, specifically primatologist). \n\n13) don\u2019t buy essential oils, they require huge amounts of water and plants to create. Also, many popular scents are actually endangered species (see #14)\n\n14) don\u2019t buy anything made from tropical hardwoods! Before purchasing anything made of wood, look into the sustainability of it. Rosewood is the #1 most trafficked species in the world, it\u2019s used for furniture, tchotchkes, essential oils, etc, and it\u2019s endangered and plays a very important role in forests (for example, some populations of red ruffed lemurs will only build nests in rosewood trees!). The darker the wood, the longer it took to grow, so while sellers might tell you they replant any trees they cut, please know that it takes centuries to regrow these trees and so they cannot be harvested sustainably. In addition to rosewood, see ebony, Purple Heart juniper, sandalwood, teak, etc. \n\n15) try and buy clothes and other fabric goods made from natural sources. Many (including the very popular microfiber) release microplastic fibers into water sources with every wash. Cotton takes a ton of water to grow, so consider hemp and linen.\n\n16) see if your energy company has green options. Mine lets me donate a percentage of my bill to solar and wind power farms. Check out u/Atom_Blue\u2019s comment on atomic power!\n\n17) while in general reusing is better, look into the efficiency of your products. Upgrading to a newer and more efficient AC unit for example is one of the biggest things you can do to lower your carbon footprint! Also look into low flow appliances and faucets. \n\n18) be skeptical of things that seem better because they\u2019re \u201cmore natural\u201d. For example, wood is not an efficient or environmentally friendly fuel source. Like I said above, essential oils are also garbage. And \u201corganic\u201d doesn\u2019t mean no pesticides, it means no NEW pesticides\u2014aka, organic veggies require more land and more pesticides than non-organic, because the newer pesticides work so well. And be aware of trade offs\u2014sure, glass is better than plastic with regards to waste...but a) glass is expensive to recycle so a lot of places aren\u2019t doing it anymore, and b) glass products are heavier, and so shipping them requires more fuel. I personally choose glass when I know I\u2019ll reuse the item. \n\n19) buy secondhand. You can get so many great things basically or actually brand new, and for so much cheaper! I got my purse secondhand, it was half the price and was never used\u2014still had the tags on it.\n\n20) have non-recyclable plastic you just don\u2019t know what to do with? Before tossing it, try [ecobricks](https://www.ecobricks.org)! You can use them yourself (I\u2019m gonna make a foot rest when I have enough), or find a drop off location. You can also suggest projects like building park benches to your local girl/boy scouts or similar organizations.\n\n21) have fewer children, and adopt.\n\n22) wear reef safe sunscreen, even if you don\u2019t think there are any reefs around. Zinc oxide is the active ingredient you want to look for! \n\n23) volunteer for cleanups! \n\n24) Get a bidet attachment so that you use less toilet paper, and/or use recycled toilet paper\n\n25) cut up old clothes into rags, and use those to clean up instead of paper towels \n\n26) turn off all lights and anything plugged in when you leave a room! Power strips make this easy.\n\n27) try to stop using k-cups, it\u2019s so much plastic! Look into getting reusable k-cups. \n\n28) swap out dryer sheets for reusable alternatives like wool balls"}, {"comment_id": "enc3osb", "post_id": "bo3qo3", "comment": "Its not a crisis until the filthy rich begin to suffer"}, {"comment_id": "enc5akg", "post_id": "bo3qo3", "comment": "Because it's not breaking news.

There have been a myriad of other laws that create nuance about relating issues, including how classification occurs, who gets to classify what, but what is utterly clear is that Congress gets the information.\n\nYou are all going to hear a lot of talk about how the President is \"ultimate arbiter\" of classification. This is intentional misdirection. Ultimately, the President can classify up or down the scale, from Unclassified all the way to special classifications that people don't even talk about (the highest common one talked about is TS:SCI, or Top Secret: Sensitive Compartmented Information, but there are a number of specialized clearances depending on subject or job) But under *no* circumstances is the President able to classify something in a way that prevents Congress from obtaining this information. This will be one of the main methods Republicans attempt to muddy the water, by saying \"The President has, or needs, to be able to control intelligence information.\" Bullshit. That's not only wrong (99% of intelligence is classified by the source of the information, e.g. the CIA uncovers information on BigBadGuy, and the *CIA* classifies the information, not the President), it's trying to bring up a *completely unrelated topic* to confuse people. This isn't about classifications, because those *do not apply to Congressional requests*.\n\nSecond, you're going to hear about \"Executive Privilege.\" This is also a lie, meant to try and muddy the waters by bringing up something unrelated. In United States v. Nixon, the court ruled that Nixon had privilege from a *judicial* request, **explicitly because oversight of the executive branch is the domain of Congress.** Additionally, the point of executive privilege is to protect a President's deliberative process -- e.g. how the President mulls over ideas in order to come to a conclusion and then execute that plan. It has *nothing* to do with how one goes about executing a plan. The idea is that there is a separation of powers, and that the Executive needs to be able to carry out very basic functions, where the President can think things through, potentially even with his staff. What we're talking about is the President talking to a foreign leader, and has nothing to do with the deliberative process, but is a negotiation with another country.\n\nAs noted above, *who* in Congress gets it is more of a grey area, but at a bare minimum, the Gang of Eight gets what they want, by law. Period. There are no more arguments on that end, it is simply a statement of fact.\n\nEdit: I'm going to add a third thing people are going to hear, that \"the report was released and therefor this isn't an impeachable offense since ultimately they complied with the law.\"\n\nThat is **not** how the law works. If you are speeding, and you get caught, you get a ticket. Even if you slow down to a legal speed after being caught by a cop, you still broke the law. By instructing the whistle-blower to not speak with Congress, by saying they would not comply with Congress's request, and by writing a memorandum justifying their action, they are showing intent to commit a crime, acted on that intent, and then attempt to cover up the crime post-facto.\n\nAnd all of this was, allegedly, at the behest of the President. I say \"allegedly\" because he still gets to see the inside of a Congressional hearing, but this isn't a fucking joke. There are no \"take-backsies\" with this stuff, because if they do get away with this, they *will* do it again."}, {"comment_id": "f1cess3", "post_id": "d8s36f", "comment": "As a European can someone explain what the process is?"}, {"comment_id": "f1cpo86", "post_id": "d8s36f", "comment": "So petty he couldn't even let Boris Johnson have the worst day.\n\nTypical. \ud83d\ude0c"}, {"comment_id": "f1captx", "post_id": "d8s36f", "comment": "WASHINGTON \u2014 Speaker Nancy Pelosi plans to announce on Tuesday that the House will begin a formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump, Democrats close to her said, taking decisive action in response to startling allegations that the president sought to enlist a foreign power for his own political gain.\n\nAfter months of caution, Ms. Pelosi has become convinced that Mr. Trump\u2019s reported actions, and his administration\u2019s refusal to share details about the matter with Congress, left the House no alternative but to move forward with an inquiry that has the potential to reshape his presidency and cleave an already divided nation just a year before he plans to stand for re-election. The people close to her confirmed her plans on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose a decision that could still change.\n\nThe announcement was expected at 5 p.m. in her Capitol office, after Ms. Pelosi was to hold a private meeting with House Democrats.\n\nAt issue are allegations that Mr. Trump pressured the president of Ukraine to open a corruption investigation of former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., a leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination, and his son. The conversation is said to be part of a whistle-blower complaint that the Trump administration has withheld from Congress.\n\nMs. Pelosi is considering creating a special committee \u2014 reminiscent of the one created by the Senate in 1973 to investigate the Watergate scandal \u2014 to look into the president\u2019s dealings with Ukraine and to potentially lay the groundwork for articles of impeachment based on the findings, according to officials briefed on the discussions who spoke about them on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe decision to begin a formal impeachment inquiry does not necessarily mean that the House will ultimately vote to charge Mr. Trump with high crimes and misdemeanors \u2014 much less that the Republican-controlled Senate will vote to remove him. But Ms. Pelosi and her leadership would not initiate the process unless they were prepared to reach that outcome.\n\nMs. Pelosi was to meet privately Tuesday afternoon with the leaders of six key committees involved in investigations of Mr. Trump, and later with the full Democratic caucus. Her announcement was planned amid a groundswell in favor of impeachment among Democrats that has intensified since late last week, with lawmakers from every corner of her caucus lining up in favor of using the House\u2019s unique power to charge Mr. Trump if the allegations are proved true, or if his administration continues to stonewall attempts by Congress to investigate them."}, {"comment_id": "f1cooc3", "post_id": "d8s36f", "comment": "Am I numb to news at this point or is this actually legit?"}, {"comment_id": "f1ceu8b", "post_id": "d8s36f", "comment": "Even if you believe elections are the best way for the public to judge his behavior, that completely falls apart when the behavior is extorting foreign powers **specifically to interfere in the election.**\n\nFor Trump merely to lose in 2020 at the ballot box and face no other sanction would set a catastrophic precedent."}, {"comment_id": "f1cmxr0", "post_id": "d8s36f", "comment": "As someone that has applied for high up government agency jobs, I must say the insane scrutiny and thoroughness of the process to get a such a job and them being so determined to make sure you\u2019re not susceptible to foreign influence or anything like that needs to be something in place for presidents too."}, {"comment_id": "f1cnbu9", "post_id": "d8s36f", "comment": "The fact that this will likely not result in Trump being convicted does not make the impeachment inquiry \"pointless\" or \"political theater\". \n\nIf you got robbed and had few details about the criminals, would filing a police report be pointless?\n\nNot impeaching is as much of a decision as impeaching.

Vonage filed a complaint with the FCC after receiving a slew of customer complaints. The FCC stepped in to sanction Madison River and prevent further blocking, but it lacks the authority to stop this kind of abuse today.\n\nCOMCAST: In 2005, the nation\u2019s largest ISP, Comcast, began secretly blocking peer-to-peer technologies that its customers were using over its network. Users of services like BitTorrent and Gnutella were unable to connect to these services. 2007 investigations from the Associated Press, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and others confirmed that Comcast was indeed blocking or slowing file-sharing applications without disclosing this fact to its customers.\n\nTELUS: In 2005, Canada\u2019s second-largest telecommunications company, Telus, began blocking access to a server that hosted a website supporting a labor strike against the company. Researchers at Harvard and the University of Toronto found that this action resulted in Telus blocking an additional 766 unrelated sites.\n\nAT&T: From 2007\u20132009, AT&T forced Apple to block Skype and other competing VOIP phone services on the iPhone. The wireless provider wanted to prevent iPhone users from using any application that would allow them to make calls on such \u201cover-the-top\u201d voice services. The Google Voice app received similar treatment from carriers like AT&T when it came on the scene in 2009.\n\nWINDSTREAM: In 2010, Windstream Communications, a DSL provider with more than 1 million customers at the time, copped to hijacking user-search queries made using the Google toolbar within Firefox. Users who believed they had set the browser to the search engine of their choice were redirected to Windstream\u2019s own search portal and results.\n\nMetroPCS: In 2011, MetroPCS, at the time one of the top-five U.S. wireless carriers, announced plans to block streaming video over its 4G network from all sources except YouTube. MetroPCS then threw its weight behind Verizon\u2019s court challenge against the FCC\u2019s 2010 open internet ruling, hoping that rejection of the agency\u2019s authority would allow the company to continue its anti-consumer practices.\n\nPAXFIRE: In 2011, the Electronic Frontier Foundation found that several small ISPs were redirecting search queries via the vendor Paxfire. The ISPs identified in the initial Electronic Frontier Foundation report included Cavalier, Cogent, Frontier, Fuse, DirecPC, RCN and Wide Open West. Paxfire would intercept a person\u2019s search request at Bing and Yahoo and redirect it to another page. By skipping over the search service\u2019s results, the participating ISPs would collect referral fees for delivering users to select websites. \n\nAT&T, SPRINT and VERIZON: From 2011\u20132013, AT&T, Sprint and Verizon blocked Google Wallet, a mobile-payment system that competed with a similar service called Isis, which all three companies had a stake in developing.\n\nEUROPE: A 2012 report from the Body of European Regulators for Electronic Communications found that violations of Net Neutrality affected at least one in five users in Europe. The report found that blocked or slowed connections to services like VOIP, peer-to-peer technologies, gaming applications and email were commonplace. \n\nVERIZON: In 2012, the FCC caught Verizon Wireless blocking people from using tethering applications on their phones. Verizon had asked Google to remove 11 free tethering applications from the Android marketplace. These applications allowed users to circumvent Verizon\u2019s $20 tethering fee and turn their smartphones into Wi-Fi hot spots. By blocking those applications, Verizon violated a Net Neutrality pledge it made to the FCC as a condition of the 2008 airwaves auction.\n\nAT&T: In 2012, AT&T announced that it would disable the FaceTime video-calling app on its customers\u2019 iPhones unless they subscribed to a more expensive text-and-voice plan. AT&T had one goal in mind: separating customers from more of their money by blocking alternatives to AT&T\u2019s own products. \n\nVERIZON: During oral arguments in Verizon v. FCC in 2013, judges asked whether the phone giant would favor some preferred services, content or sites over others if the court overruled the agency\u2019s existing open internet rules. Verizon counsel Helgi Walker had this to say: \u201cI\u2019m authorized to state from my client today that but for these rules we would be exploring those types of arrangements.\u201d Walker\u2019s admission might have gone unnoticed had she not repeated it on at least five separate occasions during arguments.\n\nSource has links to each case where you can read the legal documents about it: https://www.freepress.net/blog/2017/04/25/net-neutrality-violations-brief-history\n"}, {"comment_id": "dqghzf4", "post_id": "7g4za4", "comment": "Damn Straight, India"}, {"comment_id": "dqgpkgl", "post_id": "7g4za4", "comment": "Adding a price to the internet will only hurt the economy.

The only thing we really have is the ability to amass international pressure. Please help us.\n\n# Background of the protests:\n\nThe untimely death of at least two students in a reckless bus accident on July 29, 2018 and the intolerable remarks regarding road safety that followed from the shipping minister Shajahan Khan led to a massive and unprecedented student protest. Notably, Bangladesh has one of the worst road safety numbers as there is virtually no implementation of traffic laws and widespread corruption by the traffic police.\n\nOn July 30th, students took to the streets and stopped the roads near Hazrat Shahjalal Airport, with banners and placards that cried for better road safety, better enforcement of traffic and vehicle laws, proper punishment of the driver who caused the accident and better treatment of the victims\u2019 families by the authorities. Ever since that day, the protest has spread out to all parts of Dhaka and beyond, with students showcasing the quintessential definition of young spirit in its full glory. These students have no political affiliation and don\u2019t have a leader. They collectivized out of sheer determination to bring very necessary change . Whether it be through stopping vehicles on the street to check the license of drivers and paperwork of vehicles, creating separate lanes on the roads for different kinds of vehicles or making a policeman fine himself because he didn\u2019t have the proper license, they have done more than Bangladesh police and law enforcement agencies have managed to do in years.\n\n# Crackdown:\n\nOn the 4th of August, what happened is probably the worst clampdown on dissent a Bangladeshi individual could think of. The Bangladesh Chhatro League, the youth wing of the ruling party, has been beating up students and sexually assaulting young females in different areas of the city, as a means to stop the young voices in this protest once and for all. Four girls have been allegedly abducted and raped and more are held hostage in the City College and Dhaka College areas.\n\nThe police has been ordered to not interfere with the atrocities that BCL is doing (even without official orders, the consensus is that the police is absolutely complacent and are not stopping violence. There is a legacy of politicization in all of the state apparatus in Bangladesh).\n\nThe number of students still on the roads protesting are severely outnumbered by these vicious goons and with little local news coverage, chances of preventing more casualties and getting proper justice seems slim. We need coverage on the issue from international news agencies to gain any traction at all. We need external institutions to recognize this mass violence that is only expected to get worse and create pressure in our government to stop politicizing every movement by students and recognize the brevity of its actions.\n\n# Related Links\n\n* WARNING: Graphic NSFL images of death and bloodshed.

It can be called an absolute shithole since you have no say, and human rights are breached regularly. The worst thing is that since corruption is so rampant, there's hardly anything we can do. And if we do try, they accuse us of being against the nation or the freedom fighters, they just manipulate patriotic sentiments. Even as we speak, the government is suing and arresting people who posted videos and pictures on social media.

This country isn't simple, there are no easy solutions to anything. It's the most overpopulated country IN THE WORLD per sqm. The country continuously suffers from bouts of famine and disease while they export their rice and services to higher paying nations. \n\nIn one instance our local \"knowledge\" and designated driver, who was desperate to impress, nearly fell asleep at the wheel and ended up driving in to oncoming traffic. You could hear his foot leave the gas as he started to drift in to oncoming headlights at 4am - thankfully myself and the producer remained awake and jolted his shoulder in time. \n\nMost roads aren't paved. They're rough and ready country lanes. Their infrastructure is fucked, however, cars rarely move fast enough to cause any lethal injuries. This does however leave a lot of people maimed & disabled (alongside their budding construction industry which has literally 0 health and safety). \n\nPeople with missing limbs and disabilities were often left lying on the streets simply because there is no infrastructure to support them. In one instance we drove away from a man who was missing an eye and a leg, he was talking to himself while he lay in the gutter, surrounded by muddy water. This image stuck with me. I visited one fantastic NGO hospital run by a British expat who invested all his wealth in to starting a place to rehabilitate such people. He had since died and the organisation was being run by his wife, and local Bangladeshi's. The people are enthusiastic and motivated to help promote change in their country. But there is neither the money nor the focus to make any meaningful drive towards a common goal on a large scale. \n\nUnfortunately bad power always makes its way to the top, local ministers are often the worst of the bunch. Corrupt, they run towns like a mafia. Everything runs on bribery. There is no exception to this rule.\n\nOutside a few of the ministers i met, the people were amongst some of the nicest I've ever come to know. They're compassionate and gentle, I felt safer in their company than I often do walking through my local neighbourhood back in the UK. It's a country fuelled by frustration.\n\n___ \n\nThanks to the people that read the post. Here are two images of a NGO hospital. https://imgur.com/a/FikLvUv Construction was blocked due to local governmental corruption. There were death threats and violence involved prompting one of the charity owners to temporarily leave the country. I believe this was part of the reason behind our documentary, beyond anything else, to establish the idea of a western spotlight on the project to force the local governors to play by the rules...\n\n\nAnd here are some unedited snaps I took while driving about. They're very observational and nothing pretty (I was holding a TV camera most the time) stills weren't my focus. \nhttps://imgur.com/a/fL7fx5P\n\nMake of it what you will, all the best reddit "}, {"comment_id": "e3lfmgt", "post_id": "94ivyd", "comment": "Student wing?

Their aqcustion of power was kind of controvertial and after they attained it they kind of got rid of the main opposition leaders of BNP by either killing or imprisoning them. There had been another election held since then but it was widely regarded a false election and was just show for the outer world.\n\nNow that you understand the context, the govt has a very fragile sense of security. They know that people are fed up with them. They dont want any revolution occuring and are very wary about this. Now this protest has been gaining a lot of traction in recent days and the govt feeling insecure took this as a threat to their power. They think if they let people stand upto them then the opposition might get an upper hand and there will be change of power. Thats the govt is using its police force and student body BCl to fight against these protests as a way of clinging to power.

Cooperate with the police by providing information about the rumors: Ministry of Home Affairs.\"\n\nIt just disgusts me how the government of Bangladesh can stoop to such lows, depriving people of communication tools and then telling off the inhuman events taking place as rumours. \n\nLike seriously, you cannot deny the evidence of the dozens of students murdered along with countless human rights violations. We have seen enough. Who the fuck are they trying to fool? \n\nFrom the beginning, Bangladesh's biggest strength has been and will always be its youth. All they wanted was peace. From the liberation war until now. They accomplished something that a functioning government was unable to provide for 48 years. All they wanted was better infrastructure and safer roads. And what they get is this. Everything about this is unacceptable on so many levels. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "e3libox", "post_id": "94ivyd", "comment": "Fucking douchebags...

At around 11/12 , a large group of intruders started attacking the students. 4 students have been murdered and other 4 female students have been raped by \"Chatroleague\" and the Government is sitting there silent.

They took to the streets and checked licenses, regulated traffic, exposed a couple million people including government vehicles, officials and service workers for driving without valid licenses. They've been doing a better job than traffic regulation and law enforcement officers in the city, all they wanted was safety.\n\n\nThis is a country where bribes and corruption are rampant, and traffic regulation staff can be bribed. This protest was entirely peaceful, wholesome and supported by most citizens. The government has dealt with this with violence and other evil things carried out by \"student political parties\". They've also cut all mobile data in the country, as well as slowed internet speeds, as well as actually arresting people for posting things online that indicated dissent. Multiple journalists have been beaten up as well as their recording equipment destroyed or seized. Also, the country is a tyranny disguised as a democracy in international eyes. All the political figures in the country have either been trying to twist this event and make it fit their agenda, or giving canned responses about it.\n\n\nThey need help.

It's important to notice that before this movement, HK is relatively peaceful and the HK police rarely fire their gun. Police shooting people might be common in some countries, but they are definitely uncommon in HK. This is the reason why many HK people are angry. So everyone should read the news with this in their mind.\n\nAdditionally, the HK police has pepper sprays, tear gas bombs, and guns with rubber bullets, all of which can also disperse the crowd and has a less likely chance to critically injure the protestors. Instead, the HK police (who shoot the protestor) walk towards the crowd with his gun (that has real bullets) ready and his finger on the trigger. Some people argue that they may not be intentional, but there are many ways to defuse the situation. If they are not intentional, then they are incompetent for using the worst way to solve the situation. And this is still unacceptable. The HK police were given lethal weapons, they should be responsible and careful while using it.\n\nAnd some comments also stated that the shot protestor are also responsible for this incident, as he didn't run away and tried to fight back when the police is pointing a gun at the protesters. Yes, his action may not be wise, but he's only 16, and untrained, and never experience similar situation before (this is the first time the HK police fire real bullets in point blank range). Shouldn't we be a little more forgiving towards this protester?\n\nAlso, some commenters are giving the HK police the benefit of the doubt. However, the HK police's action in this movement isn't flattering at all: they pepper-sprayed the journalists when there's no protesters next to them, they use vulgar words to insult the journalists, legislative council members, and first-aiders, they stormed a train carriage (that has people who are not protesters) and beat the train's passengers, they shot a female journalists right in the eye, they cuffed up first-aiders (who help everyone on the protest site) and yelled at them, they kicked a protester's head and claimed that they were just kicking a \"yellow object\", they pull off a female protester's underwear, call her a slut, and refuse to let her get dressed... I understand that some commenters may believe in the HK police, and if a similar incident occur in some countries with good police, I may also believe in those police. But HK police are not good police: the past action of HK police in these few months show that HK police had done, and are willing to do many horrible things. They are not trustworthy at all, and their brutality must be stopped.\n\nEdit: Here's New York Times' analysis of the shooting that gives a fuller picture of this incident.\n\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/video/world/asia/100000006745719/hong-kong-protester-shot.html?smid=tw-nytvideo&smtyp=cur"}, {"comment_id": "f23ep5v", "post_id": "dbqgb0", "comment": "This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/politics/article/3031044/chaos-expected-across-hong-kong-anti-government-protesters) reduced by 57%.

Possible options are:\n\n- No deal brexit\n\n- Second referendum\n\n- Trying to renegotiate the deal with the EU\n\n- Keep trying to pass this bill in parliament"}, {"comment_id": "ee5502y", "post_id": "agccop", "comment": "Update : A motion of no confidence has been tabled by Jeremy Corbyn"}, {"comment_id": "ee5jhb0", "post_id": "agccop", "comment": "So for our cousins across the pond, and elsewhere in the world asking what this means. Here's a step by step\n\n- UK Prime minister drafted a deal with the EU that outlines the terms of the UK's exit from the EU. This is a massive document.\n- People in the government itself were against this deal because of numerous reasons. Primarily the \"backstop\". \n\n*Backstop quickly explained: During the transition period between now and end of 2020, nothing will change. If by the end of that period the people above us fail to come to an arrangement about the land border between Northern Ireland and Republic of Ireland, the backstop puts the UK in the customs union until something can be done, with Northern Ireland under heavier EU rules than the rest of the UK*\n\n- People in the opposition party (Labour) are against the deal because they want power.\n- The opposition wants a \"soft\" brexit, meaning the UK stays in some customs union that doesn't align with the rest of the custom union rules. \n- The Government doesn't know what they want, some want the deal, some don't want any deal, some want an amended deal\n\n*Does this cancel brexit?*\n\nNo, it doesn't. It just means the UK is back to square one with deciding how to leave.\n\n*Why didn't this pass?*\n\nBecause of the points above, and the prime minister cannot command a majority.\n\n*Vote of no confidence?*\n\nYes, so recently in December there was a legal coup attempt to get rid of the PM. That failed by quite a lot. This means that the PM cannot be ousted by her own party for another year. But this doesn't prevent the opposition from tabling a no confidence vote in the entirety of government.\n\n*How would they win?*\n\nSimple, they need to convince people in power to give up their power and vote with them.\n\n*If no confidence vote fails, does this mean no deal?*\n\nDepends on a lot. A finance bill went through recently preventing the government from investing in a no deal scenario. This was an attempt to stop a no deal brexit. A lot of preparation needs to happen for no deal to happen, otherwise... yeah, things will be *bad*. \n\n*Can the PM just say \"fuck you I'm doing X\"?*\n\nNope, this isn't a dictatorship. Due to a bill passed last year, Parliament voted to have control over everything that's brexit, that includes a no deal.\n\nSo if there is to be a no deal, Parliament will need to vote on it (this includes everyone in the house).\n\n*Why doesn't the PM resign?*\n\nShe's stubborn as fuck\n\n*What happens next?*\n\nNo one really knows. Here's what we do know...\n\nTomorrow will be the no confidence vote. If it passes, that means the Government can either make way for a General Election (whoop dee doo, yet *another* vote!), or can try to make deals with certain parties to reform government. The latter is very, very unlikely to happen, since they already made a deal with the DUP to form a majority... it didn't work out for them.\n\nAfter that, it all depends. If there's a general election, we'll likely see an extension to A50, it will need to be agreed to by the EU though. Chances are, they'll agree. (It's important to be friends with your neighbours, especially if 60% of your trade is with them).\n\nIf there's no general election, then the PM will have numerous meetings with the opposition and other members of the house, to figure out what can get through parliament and the EU. Again, chances are here, an extension to A50.\n\n*I heard about another referendum?*\n\nTo put it simply, it's not going to happen while the Tory's are in power. Again, there needs to be a majority in parliament for the vote to happen. The majority don't support a vote.\n\nWe do know though, that if Labour loses the no confidence vote, then they will be pushing for the 2nd referendum. So I guess, everything is on the table right now.\n\n**TLDR?**\n\nShit's fucked yo"}, {"comment_id": "ee59fo7", "post_id": "agccop", "comment": "I\u2019m calling it.

The original case that called for the creation of the law seems like it could be good(ish)?  Obviously, it could also be horrible and abused, and I get why HK citizens would protest it.   But, if someone is committing murder and not being able to be held accountable (and even worse in this case, of his pregnant GF), that seems fairly awful also?   I apologize for not being better educated on this, but this is the purpose of this comment.  The accused murderer was in Taiwan at the time, and so can't be sent there to stand trial as there is no extradition agreement there.  Maybe HK could just have a bill with ONLY taiwan?  I dunno, I 1000% understand why HK would be pissed about a law from china that would just let it snatch up it's people and haul them off to mainland china for almost no reason....But I also wouldn't want a murderer to just get off totally free for killing his pregnant GF?

This passage explores exactly how the German people transitioned from frustrated citizens in 1933 to full-blown Nazis in 1945. Here's the thing: changes like that don't happen overnight, it takes quite a long time. The issue is that the change is so gradual, and each time things get 'worse' it's in small enough increments that people are not compelled to take action until it's too late. I urge people to look at the similarities between this passage and what is happening in the US right now. This isn't to say that Donald Trump is the next Hitler or anything, it's simply meant to draw attention to how far a people can slip when they let each 'small issue' go unpunished. The passage:\n\n>\"...Each act, each occasion, is worse than the last, but only a little worse. You wait for the next and the next. You wait for one great shocking occasion, thinking that others, when such a shock comes, will join with you in resisting somehow. You don't want to act, or even talk, alone; you don't want to 'go out of your way to make trouble.' Why not?-Well, you are not in the habit of doing it. And it is not just fear, fear of standing alone, that restrains you; it is also genuine uncertainty. Uncertainty is a very important factor, and, instead of decreasing as time goes on, it grows. Outside, in the streets, in the general community, 'everyone' is happy. One hears no protest, and certainly sees none. You know, in France or Italy there would be slogans against the government painted on walls and fences; in Germany, outside the great cities, perhaps, there is not even this. In the university community, in your own community, you speak privately to your colleagues, some of whom certainly feel as you do; but what do they say? They say, 'It's not so bad' or 'You're seeing things' or 'You're an alarmist.'  \n>  \n>And you are an alarmist. You are saying that this must lead to this, and you can't prove it. These are the beginnings, yes; but how do you know for sure when you don't know the end, and how do you know, or even surmise, the end? On the one hand, your enemies, the law, the regime, the Party, intimidate you. On the other, your colleagues pooh-pooh you as pessimistic or even neurotic. You are left with your close friends, who are, naturally, people who have always thought as you have....  \n>  \n>But the one great shocking occasion, when tens or hundreds or thousands will join with you, never comes. That's the difficulty. If the last and worst act of the whole regime had come immediately after the first and smallest, thousands, yes, millions would have been sufficiently shocked-if, let us say, the gassing of the Jews in '43 had come immediately after the 'German Firm' stickers on the windows of non-Jewish shops in '33. But of course this isn't the way it happens. In between come all the hundreds of little steps, some of them imperceptible, each of them preparing you not to be shocked by the next. Step C is not so much worse than Step B, and, if you did not make a stand at Step B, why should you at Step C? And so on to Step D.  \n>  \n>And one day, too late, your principles, if you were ever sensible of them, all rush in upon you. The burden of self-deception has grown too heavy, and some minor incident, in my case my little boy, hardly more than a baby, saying 'Jewish swine,' collapses it all at once, and you see that everything, everything, has changed and changed completely under your nose. The world you live in-your nation, your people-is not the world you were born in at all. The forms are all there, all untouched, all reassuring, the houses, the shops, the jobs, the mealtimes, the visits, the concerts, the cinema, the holidays. But the spirit, which you never noticed because you made the lifelong mistake of identifying it with the forms, is changed. Now you live in a world of hate and fear, and the people who hate and fear do not even know it themselves; when everyone is transformed, no one is transformed. Now you live in a system which rules without responsibility even to God. The system itself could not have intended this in the beginning, but in order to sustain itself it was compelled to go all the way.\"\n\n\\-Milton Mayer, They Thought They Were Free: The Germans 1933-1945"}, {"comment_id": "ealcjs9", "post_id": "a0yeil", "comment": "This is the best tl;dr I could make, [original](https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/418487-auschwitz-museum-says-its-important-to-remember-holocaust-did) reduced by 83%.

They ignored the weapon guidelines and fired tear gas indoor in the carriage which is in fact lethal. Also, they beat up innocent people causing them seriously wounded. Some passengers kneeled before them asking them to stop but the response they got were beaten ever harder.

I\u2019m also concerned that the expulsion of diplomats will only serve to embolden Putin.\n\nHere are two potential strategies that may work:\n\n1- Fast track the acceptance of Finland and the Ukraine into NATO and assist Kiev in expelling those vacationing soldiers, with Force. My concern with this is that Force begets Force and this could lead us to a major confrontation \n\n2- Strongly invest in alternatives to Russian natural gas to continue weakening his economy while appealing to his political weaknesses. Give aid directly to Russian citizens through UK controlled NGOs with very transparent accounting of the aid distribution. Use this to develop popular support for native candidates who champion democracy.\n\nThe two strategies could be used together but a big part is messaging directly to the Russian citizens because Putin\u2019s control of the media allows him to control the narrative that his citizens see. Maybe a UK version of Russia Today (RT).\n\nEdit- I\u2019m not sure how to strike out a word from mobile, so I\u2019ll leave it as is but I wanted to make a correction.

By the same token, it's *imaginable* that anybody could get a hold of or create a nuclear weapon, even in a household basement. That's ignoring the fact that such an idea is just ridiculous on its face, and while *possible* it's stupidly unlikely. It's not like I can just go out and buy some household bleach, lye, and a Novichok \"cookbook\" and make Novichok in my bedroom. It requires expensive, sophisticated facilities and expertise that know how to make Novichok, which is Soviet in nature. If anything to Russia's defense, Novichok could have gotten into the wrong hands (i.e., not theirs), in which case they should have said just that and provided evidence. This is exactly the reason May gave an ultimatum for response in the first place.\n\n\nSecond of all, if you're expecting to get exhaustive evidence/proof in this case, you're never going to get it. Unless you were at Salisbury first hand; saw the attacker and victims; heard with your own ears, \"I'm a Russian assassin, prepare to die\"; and the assailant happened to leave behind some credentials proving his background to discredit any kind of \"false flag\" accusation, you will never be 100% sure. And it's unreasonable to expect that you could ever be 100% sure; you have better things to do. At the end of the day you're going to have to go by the word of the media---whether you trust them or not is your prerogative, but I'm seeing plenty of people willing to cast aside the condemnations of France, Germany, the U. S., and the U.

Marijuana flowers take about 6 months from cradle to grave (from germination until they are ready to smoke) accounting for both stages of the life cycle and a modest cure period.\n\nThe reason why the personal use growth exemption is so critical is because efforts are already well under way to carve out grants of oligopoly production in the lucrative marijuana growing industry. The best solution would be to simply have an unregulated free market in marijuana. That is to say allow anyone to grow, produce, buy or sell marijuana. There is absolutely no legitimate reason to allow only a few large and powerful corporations to have strict control over the legal marijuana industry at the expense of potential smaller competitors. The marijuana industry is a powerful case study in the actual role of regulations in the market economy, which are not, contrary to popular belief, a means of ensuring companies act in the public interest but rather a method by which established business interests can smash their smaller competitors through the imposition of high fixed costs on an industry.

The village/town dates back to the Song Dynasty some 800 years ago.\n* Yuen Long has been a stronghold of triads for many generations, really since the beginning. Its local politicians, triads and police are well connected. \n* Triad violence in HK in general largely ended in the mid 1990s just prior to repatriation. In the 1980s it was common to have triads fighting in the streets. Such events have not been witnessed in HK in over 2 decades until last night. But last night was special since triad violence is almost exclusively limited to other triads.\n* Normally, the Triads in Yuen Long make their money from low level drug and prostitution. They no longer even run protection rackets. \n* While not usually political, the Triads do have a reputation for conservatism and nationalism. Yuen Long in general is a fairly pro-China neighborhood.\n\nRegarding the actual attack last night the details are still unclear and there's been no firm statement of their motives. The attackers were indiscriminate, and many were not afraid to show their faces on camera. The police were indeed late to scene and so far no arrests have been made.\n\nI'd hold final judgement until at least a few days to see what this was all about. If the police make no arrests despite all the video evidence and ID, in the next week or so, then that would be pretty solid ground to indicate the police were indeed in cahoots with the triads on this attack."}, {"comment_id": "eue68j3", "post_id": "cg1sh2", "comment": "Chinese soldiers out of uniform??"}, {"comment_id": "euexxiy", "post_id": "cg1sh2", "comment": "[Tiananmen Square, We must never forget. ](https://imgur.com/a/gREeNhb)\n\nNSFW.

Chechens are overwhelmingly adherents to the Shafi'i Madhhab of Sunni Islam, the republic having converted to Islam between the 16th and the 19th centuries. Due to historical importance, many Chechens are Sufis, of either the Qadiri or Naqshbandi orders. Most of the population follows either the Shafi'i or the Hanafi, schools of jurisprudence, fiqh. The Shafi'i school of jurisprudence has a long tradition among the Chechens, and thus it remains the most practiced.\n\nSource: \n\n- Mairbek Vatchagaev (September 8, 2006). \"The Kremlin's War on Islamic Education in the North Caucasus\".

First and foremost I want to say this: I'm from Russia and I just recently finished my service as a conscript in a certain spetsnaz unit which I won't name but I'll say specializes in internal anti-terror affairs, e.g. gets stationed in North Caucasus. Now, you might know that Russia holds the V-day parade every year since WW2 and my unit's division partakes in it every year since then as well. Now, the only year when our division wasn't on the parade was in 1995 when the Chechen war broke out. Seeing as how conflicts within our borders is my division's (and branch's) modus operandi, it was deployed to Chechnya in its entirety. That's 13000 men, or rather, boys. 30% came back (wikipedia casualties is bs; we really fucked up in that war). Now this guy (in the picture), this \"hero\" of Russia (he even has the fucking star, the highest honor in our military, smfh) was part of the Chechen command and is personally responsible for deaths, decapitations, other mutilations, torture of thousands of Russian conscripts; young boys like you or your little brother, person who is reading this (think about it for a second, then google pictures of what chechens did to russians during the war). Then, when the time was right, he took part in the assassination of his father, the Chechen leader at the time, and replaced him as the now head of state, our president's puppet. \nI ask you this: what would you expect from this person and his mob?

Here it is, in it's entirety:\n\nExcellency,\n\nNearly two years ago, the international community gathered within this UNFCCC forum, with most of its highest government representatives, and after a long and complex debate arrived at the adoption of the historic Paris Agreement. It saw the achievement of consensus on the need to launch a shared strategy to counteract one of the most worrying phenomena our humanity is experiencing: climate change.\n\nThe will to follow this consensus was highlighted by the speed with which the Paris Agreement entered into force, less than a year after its adoption.\n\nThe Agreement indicates a clear path of transition to a low- or zero-carbon model of economic development, encouraging solidarity and leveraging the strong links between combating climate change and poverty. This transition is further solicited by the climatic urgency that requires greater commitment from the countries, some of which must endeavour to take a leading role in this transition, bearing in mind the needs of the most vulnerable populations.\n\nThese days you are gathered in Bonn to carry out another important phase of the Paris Agreement: the process of defining and constructing guidelines, rules and institutional mechanisms so that it may be truly effective and capable of contributing to the achievement of the complex objectives it proposes. In such a path, it is necessary to maintain a high level of cooperation.\n\nFrom this perspective, I would like to reaffirm my urgent call to renew dialogue on how we are building the future of the planet. We need an exchange that unites us all, because the environmental challenge we are experiencing, and its human roots, regards us all, and affects us all. [...] Unfortunately, many efforts to seek concrete solutions to the environmental crisis are often frustrated for various reasons ranging from denial of the problem to indifference, comfortable resignation, or blind trust in technical solutions (cf. Encyclical Laudato si\u2019, 14).\nWe should avoid falling into the trap of these four perverse attitudes, which certainly do not help honest research or sincere and productive dialogue on building the future of our planet: denial, indifference, resignation and trust in inadequate solutions.\n\nMoreover, we cannot limit ourselves only to the economic and technological dimension: technical solutions are necessary but not sufficient; it is essential and desirable to carefully consider the ethical and social impacts and impacts of the new paradigm of development and progress in the short, medium and long term.\n\nFrom this perspective, it is increasingly necessary to pay attention to education and lifestyles based on an integral ecology, capable of taking on a vision of honest research and open dialogue where the various dimensions of the Paris Agreement are intertwined. It is useful to remember that the Agreement recalls the \u201cgrave \u2026 ethical and moral responsibility to act without delay, in a manner as free as possible from political and economic pressures, setting aside particular interests and behaviour\u201d (cf. Message to COP-22). This means, in effect, propagating a \u201cresponsible awareness\u201d towards our common home (cf. Encyclical Laudato si\u2019, 202; 231) through the contribution of all, in explaining the different forms of action and partnership between the various stakeholders, some of whom do not lack to highlight the ingenuity of the human being in favour of the common good.\n\nWhile I send my greetings to you, Mr President, and to all the participants in this Conference, I hope that, with your authoritative guidance and that of the Fiji Islands, the work of these days will be inspired by the same collaborative and prophetic spirit manifested during the COP-21. This will enable an acceleration of awareness-raising and consolidate the will to make effective decisions to counteract the phenomenon of climate change while at the same time fighting poverty and promoting true human development as a whole. This commitment is supported by the wise providence of God Most High.\n\nvia http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/11/16/pope_francis_sends_letter_to_cop23_climate_conference_in_bon/1349337/\n\nwhich is down right now; accessed through internet archive:\nhttps://web.archive.org/web/20171117015206/http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/11/16/pope_francis_sends_letter_to_cop23_climate_conference_in_bon/1349337/"}, {"comment_id": "dq405jw", "post_id": "7eb01h", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dq3qvwo", "post_id": "7eb01h", "comment": "This new pope is awesome.

And Al-Fitnah [disbelief or unrest] is worse than killing...\nbut if they desist, then lo! Allah is forgiving and merciful. And fight them until there is no more Fitnah [disbelief and worshipping of others along with Allah] and worship is for Allah alone. But if they cease, let there be no transgression except against Az-Zalimun (the polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc.)\"\n\nQuran 3:151 \"Soon shall We cast terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers, for that they joined companions with Allah, for which He had sent no authority\".\n\nQuran 3:56 \"As to those who reject faith, I will punish them with terrible agony in this world and in the Hereafter, nor will they have anyone to help.\"\n\nClearly, the doctrine of Islam supports religious violence. Stating this fact is taboo, offensive, controversial, and considered to be bigotry. Obviously it shouldn't be, especially after this tragedy. Even if you are able to \"reinterpret\" these (and many more) passages to mean something more benign, it should still be apparent that not all muslims do the same - as evidenced by all of the senseless killings occurring in the name of allah. I don't know how to stop jihad, but I do know that we will never get to that point if we can't even bring ourselves to honestly describe what is happening. Muslim extremists are not extreme in how they interpret their religious texts. They are actually just doing what the book says. The only thing extreme about this are the words in the Quran, and the fact that a human being is actually capable of living by those words.

I cited I think 6 or so real studies that showed that piracy had no noticeable effect on profit and that the companies were likely losing money fighting it instead of ignoring it.\n\nThis was for a 3 page paper for my goddamn English II class over 10 years ago. The only reason the crusade against piracy still exists is because company execs go with their gut feeling a 3rd party DRM sales rep is selling them instead of spending the 6 hours I spent researching the topic. And so the real consumers AND the company suffer as a result.\n\nI refused to buy Sonic Mania because they delayed it on PC so they could add DRM to it. I don't want to be treated like a suspect when I'm giving you my money. I don't want to be one of those people the DRM completely fucks up for. I don't want THOSE people to even have that happen because it shouldn't need to.\n\nMost people who pirate cannot or will not buy the thing in question. No matter what. On the other hand, some people pirate because the owning company doesn't take the effort to make their product available. Look at the foreign prices of some of the mainstream titles on Steam - some of them cost a *month* of pay for one game, because the publisher can't be assed to look up the actual information. Some games are just never flagged as sellable in some countries.\n\nYou want to reduce piracy? Pay some non idiot 60k a year or whatever to fix those easy issues. It'll more than pay for itself and it's a hell of a lot cheaper than drinking Denuvo Kool-Aid"}, {"comment_id": "dncf4ag", "post_id": "71nmck", "comment": "As an indie filmmaker, I welcome the piracy of my content.

It's been part of the entertainment business model since records were invented and probably long before that when printing presses were common.\n\nThe reality is that piracy is an advertising platform and a very effective one.  In more recent times, Photoshop would not have gained it's level of market penetration if it wasn't so widely available to students who would never have spent the money on it.  Tons of bands with cult followings never would have developed those followings without bootleg recordings and easy access to their music.  Once those followings develop money gets made, but there's no pretending that they would have developed otherwise.  \n\nThe anti-piracy movement is not about stopping piracy.  It's about controlling market and mind share.  As long as you _think_ the best movies are $100+M blockbusters, you will keep paying $20 to see the latest Tom Cruise movie in the theaters.  \n\nBut the movement comes at a cost.  There was a solid decade when the music industry produced nothing new of any real value.  The 98-08 collection isn't going to produce much of a nostalgic back catalog because there's very little there.  It's lost revenue, but there was a reason and a business plan around it.  There was potential for the entire market to be lost.  Many independents have come around, but the majority of the move and music markets are still controlled by the same companies.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dnc43g3", "post_id": "71nmck", "comment": "Misleading title.

Nobody wakes up one day and says \"You know what? I've decided i'm going to be sexually attracted to prepubescent children.\"\n\nWhether or not a pedophile commits an act of assault doesn't seem to matter, they're still stigmatized.\n\nAnd what's really horrifying to me as an onlooker is that even people I know who are REALLY open-minded about social issues, sexual orientation, etc., they still often say \"Yeah well I still think we should round them all up.\"\n\nIt's either a sexual orientation or it's a mental illness. It's one of those, and in either case, it's not the person's fault they are that way.\n\nDeciding to commit an act of sexual assault against a child, that's a choice, but being a pedophile is a state of being, not an action you take.\n\nI mean, look at the suicide rate for homosexual people even today. While the obvious difference is that you can have a homosexual relationship without hurting anybody, which is not the case with pedophilia, they're still the nature of being sexually and physically attracted to certain physical characteristics.\n\nSo, the question then is, how do we enable Pedophiles to satisfy those desires in a way that doesn't hurt anyone?\n\nExcept, it's not the question, because society is unwilling to even ask it.\n\nAnd in the meantime, we wonder what drives these people to abuse small children, and why we can't seem to do anything about it.\n\nDestigmatize it, give these people a platform from which to get help, and then maybe it will ACTUALLY protect our children.\n\nBut it'll never happen. We love having an evil to rail against, and there are few things better than child molesters to rail against. It helps us feel righteous. And then the tens of thousands of young children sexually assaulted each year have to pay the price for that."}, {"comment_id": "f17drba", "post_id": "d84sov", "comment": "Which half of Ukraine, the NATO half or the Russian half"}, {"comment_id": "f17edn7", "post_id": "d84sov", "comment": "Facebook & twitter have been propaganda tools for a long time."}, {"comment_id": "f176zl8", "post_id": "d84sov", "comment": "US Elections 2020: Everyone\u2019s invited!"}, {"comment_id": "f175t4z", "post_id": "d84sov", "comment": ">The \"I Love America\" Facebook page boasts 1.1 million fans, with viral content that reaches more Facebook users than some of the largest media outlets in the United States. A typical post is a celebration of the U.S. military and patriotism.\n\n>There are lots of references to \"our country\" and \"our military.\" Not mentioned is that the page is managed by ten people based in Ukraine. (There is also one manager from Kazakhstan, one from France, and one from the United States.) A website that was previously linked in the \"About\" section of the \"I Love America\" page is registered to Andriy Zyuzikov, an online strategist from the Ukrainian city of Odessa.\n\n>The \"I Love America\" page regularly recycles memes used by the Internet Research Agency, the Russian entity that set up phony Facebook pages to benefit Trump in advance of the 2016 election. \n\n>While \"I Love America,\" which was established in March 2017, focuses on patriotism, in recent weeks it has used its extraordinary reach to push pro-Trump propaganda. \n\n>These pro-Trump memes are cross-posted from several explicitly pro-Trump pages, with names like \"God bless Donald and Melania Trump and God bless America.\"  All of these pages, which were created in the last few months, are managed exclusively by people based out of Ukraine. \n\n>But the \"I Love America\" page is only the tip of the iceberg. There is a complex network of Facebook pages, all managed by people in Ukraine, that collect large audiences by posting memes about patriotism, Jesus, and cute dogs. These pages are now being used to funnel large audiences to pro-Trump propaganda. The pages have also joined political Facebook groups and are active on Instagram, which is owned by Facebook. \n\n>Facebook promised this would not happen again. \u201cIn 2016, we were not prepared for the coordinated information operations we now regularly face. But we have learned a lot since then and have developed sophisticated systems that combine technology and people to prevent election interference on our services,\u201d Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in 2018. \n\n>While there is no indication that the Ukrainian network of Facebook pages is backed by any government, they are exposing Americans to a flood of inauthentic and manipulative content related to the 2020 election. \n\n>David Carroll, a professor at The New School and an expert in social media, called the existence of the Ukrainian network \"troubling\" and said it suggests Facebook has \"not decided to use their own detection technology to prevent further dissemination by 'inauthentic coordination.'\" \n\n>Renee DiResta, a technical research manager at the Stanford Internet Observatory, told Popular Information that activities of these Ukrainian Facebook pages heightened her concern that \"foreign agitators\" are \"joining political Groups created and inhabited by real Americans.\" \n\n>A Facebook spokesperson told Popular Information that the company does not believe any of the Facebook pages discussed in this article violate its policies, including the policy against \"coordinated inauthentic behavior.\" Facebook defines \"coordinated inauthentic behavior\" as \"when groups of pages or people work together to mislead others about who they are or what they are doing.\"\n\n>Ukrainian \"I Love America\" page is recycling memes from Russian interference operation\n\n>The Mueller Report detailed Russia's efforts, through the Internet Research Agency (IRA), to interfere with the 2016 presidential election. One of the IRA pages was called  \"Being Patriotic\" and amassed over 200,000 followers before it was taken down by Facebook in 2017. The memes posted by \"Being Patriotic,\" however, were archived by researcher Josh Russell. \n\n>The \"I Love America\" page reuses numerous memes that were posted on \"Being Patriotic.\"\n\n>The page, which is the largest known to be recirculating IRA memes, also repurposed IRA content in Facebook videos. \n\n>Massive \"I Love America\" page funneling users to pro-Trump propaganda\n\n>While the \"I Love America\" page was created in 2017, in recent weeks it has cross-posted content from explicitly pro-Trump pages, including \"Click Like, if you love Donald Trump as much as we do. TRUMP 2020,\" \"God bless Donald Trump and God bless America,\" and \"God bless Donald and Melania Trump and God bless America.\" All of these pages, which were created in the last few months, are managed exclusively by people based in Ukraine.\n\n>The content posted on these pages is incendiary and frequently includes misinformation. The meme on the left, for example, falsely claims that Hillary Clinton sold access to her email server to foreign governments. \n\n>The remarkable reach of \"I Love America\"\n\n>The \"I Love America\" Facebook page has a massive reach on the platform that exceeds nearly all U.S. media companies. According to Crowdtangle, a social analytics company owned by Facebook, \"I Love America\" has more engagement -- likes, shares, and comments -- over the last 90 days than USA Today, one of the largest media organizations in the country with 8 million Facebook followers. Over the same period, the engagement of \"I Love America\" dwarfs major publications like the LA Times and digitally native outlets like BuzzFeed News. More engagement on Facebook corresponds directly to a bigger reach, and more people seeing the content. \n\n>Using cute dogs and Jesus to recruit new Trump supporters\n\n>\"I Love America\" is part of a complex network of Facebook pages managed by people in Ukraine that cross-post content and, more recently, direct users to pro-Trump propaganda. Some of these pages, including \"Like our page if you are proud to be an American\" and \"Everyone should respect and stand for our American Flag. God Bless,\" play on similar patriotic themes. But the network also attempts to draw in users with other interests, including cute animals. \n\n>For example, the \"Cute or Not?\" Facebook page, which was established in July 2017, has eight page managers based in Ukraine. (There is also one manager based in Kazakhstan and one in the United States.)  Typically, it posts images of cute dogs. \n\n>But recently, \"Cute or Not?\" also has cross-posted content from \"God bless Donald and Melania Trump and God bless America.\" \n\n>\"Cute or Not?\" has also cross-posted content from other Facebook pages in the Ukrainian network, including \"US Federal Insider.\"\n\n>Ukrainians also operate a page called \"I Love Jesus Forever.\" Most of the posts, as you might expect, are about God and Jesus. \n\n>But the \"I Love Jesus Forever\" page has also started cross-posting pro-Trump memes from \"God bless Donald Trump and God bless America.\" \n\n>The extraordinary power of the Ukrainian Facebook network\n\n>None of the IRA pages identified in the Mueller Report had more than 390,000 followers. The Ukrainian network is much larger, with \"I Love America\" boasting over a million followers and multiple pages with 400,000 followers or more.\n\n>It's not possible, from outside the company, to identify the full scope of the Ukrainian network. But, using \"I Love America\" as a starting point, Popular Information cataloged pages overwhelming or exclusively managed from Ukraine that cross-posted each other's content. Using Crowdtangle, which catalogs most of the larger pages, it is then possible to get a sense of the scope of the network's reach. \n\n>Over the last 90 days, these pages have garnered 30 million engagements on Facebook. \n\n>To put that in perspective, over the same time period, New York Times, typically one of the top five publishers on Facebook, had less than 18 million engagements. The Washington Post, over the last 90 days, has 14 million engagements. The reach of this Ukrainian Facebook network, repurposing IRA memes and cute puppy pics, is as large as the two most prestigious papers in the United States combined. \n\n>The reach of the Ukrainian networks is now being weaponized to boost incendiary pro-Trump content. Although the explicitly pro-Trump pages are still small, one post published to \"God bless Donald Trump and god bless America\" has over 44,000 shares. It's an extremely impressive number for a small page that was started just weeks ago. \n\n>The motivation\n\n>Ben Nimmo, director of investigations at Grafika, believes that the Ukrainian network of Facebook pages lacks the sophistication to be a government-backed effort. \"We're seeing state-linked operators trying harder to hide, reducing their linguistic footprint, masking their technical signals and covering up the identities of the people behind them,\" Nimmo told Popular Information. \n\n>In this case, the location of the page managers was available through a transparency tool that Facebook put into place after the 2016 election. Nimmo believes this operation \"looks more like a clickbait group trying to build followers by posting cat photos, horses, and patriotic memes.\" \n\n>Still, the impact on American voters could be the same, especially if the tactics include bombarding Americans with false and divisive political material."}, {"comment_id": "f177tpm", "post_id": "d84sov", "comment": "Have 20 friends who like the page.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nInteresting part is, 5 of them would identify themselves as Democrats"}, {"comment_id": "f17bote", "post_id": "d84sov", "comment": ">The \"I Love America\" page regularly recycles memes used by the Internet Research Agency, the Russian entity that set up phony Facebook pages to benefit Trump in advance of the 2016 election.\n\noh.\n\n\nHe is literally arranging attacks on our next election to sway it in his favor. \n\nThere is no combination of words you can make up that could justify supporting this person."}, {"comment_id": "f17h871", "post_id": "d84sov", "comment": "At this point I wouldn't be surprised if facebook itself is cashing from this as well."}, {"comment_id": "f17c5t5", "post_id": "d84sov", "comment": "> In December 2015, Russian Federation President Vladimir Putin admitted that Russian military intelligence officers were operating in Ukraine, insisting though that they were not the same as regular troops.\n___\n> Currently, 7% of Ukraine's territory is under occupation.\n\n^[Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine_\\(2014%E2%80%93present\\))\n\nHmmm, that Ukranian pro-Trump page *definitely* wasn't Russian. /s"}, {"comment_id": "f17a1ie", "post_id": "d84sov", "comment": "Yet another example of the simplistic nationalistic love of country.

This never happened, of course. Boris had found the article somewhere online, and he needed to feed his web\u00adsite, Daily Interesting Things, so he appropriated the text, down to its last mis\u00adbegotten comma. He posted the link on Facebook, seeding it within various groups devoted to American politics; to his astonish\u00adment, it was shared around 800 times. That month\u2014February 2016\u2014Boris made more than $150 off the Google ads on his website. Considering this to be the best possible use of his time, he stopped going to high school.\n\n>In the final weeks of the US presidential election, Veles attained a weird infamy in the most powerful nation on earth; stories in The Guardian and on BuzzFeed revealed that the Macedonian town of 55,000 was the registered home of at least 100 pro-Trump websites, many of them filled with sensationalist, utterly fake news. (The imminent criminal indictment of Hillary Clinton was a popular theme; another was the pope\u2019s approval of Trump.) The sites\u2019 ample traffic was rewarded handsomely by automated advertising engines, like Google\u2019s AdSense. An article in The New Yorker described how President Barack Obama himself spent a day in the final week of the campaign talking \u201calmost obsessively\u201d about Veles and its \u201cdigital gold rush.\u201d\n\n>Within Veles itself, the young entrepreneurs behind these websites became subjects of tantalizing intrigue. Between August and November, Boris earned nearly $16,000 off his two pro-Trump websites. The average monthly salary in Macedonia is $371.\n\nand it's not just political sites\n\n>In Veles, Aleksandar and Borce Velkovski are so renowned for the health food website they started that they\u2019re known as the Healthy Brothers. HealthyFoodHouse.com is a jumble of diet and beauty advice, natural remedies, and other nostrums. It gorges on advertising as it counsels readers to put a bar of soap under their bedsheets to relieve nightly leg cramps or to improve their red-blood-cell count with homemade beet syrup. Somehow the website\u2019s Facebook page has drawn 2 million followers; more than 10 million unique visitors come to HealthyFoodHouse.com every month.\n\n>Mirko Ceselkoski began to play in the early 2000s. He built seven or eight websites\u2014about muscle cars or celebrities or superyachts, all oriented toward the American reader, because an American reader is roughly three times more valuable than a non-American one. For five or six hours of daily toil, Ceselkoski says, you can earn approximately $1,000 a month.

It discusses society's willingness to ignore the suffering of others for the sake of a fast, \"easy\" solution (say, rather than looking into reform of the private prison system to rehabilitate convicts or working on curing Lung Cancer, simply taking the lung of a convict and giving it to someone who has Lung Cancer, along with spreading all his other organs and body to other people who need or want it.)\n\n\nThe fact that this is actually happening in real life is giving me a new sense of existential horror.

You at the very least need a paralyzed patient being ventilated by a machine to get a usable organ.\n\nA transplanted organ includes the vessels that feed that organ. You can't open up the person, rip out the kidney, and shove it into another person. You need to make sure you have viable vessels of the appropriate length and position otherwise your organ will just die in someone else's body. That surgery requires precision. Someone who is moving around won't let you make something precise.\n\nAlso, sure, you can paralyze and ventilate someone without giving them anesthetic, so they'll be conscious. But why? If you want to be monstrous and torture a person, I guess you can...though the increased heart rate and blood pressure will probably make the surgery bloodier and the result less useful.

This means a good portion of US based corporations which set up to take advantage of the large portion of EU skilled workers will be making to move back to America, Ireland specifically is extremely worried, as a good portion of their economy in early 80's-2000's was built around undercutting American corporate tax rates. \n\nAlso the 10% tax rate to bring overseas money from American corporations back into America will also drastically hurt the EU banks. Which is not good at all, Deutsche bank, like Lehman Brother's, took on a bunch of toxic derivatives and is on the brink of collapse. On top of all that Merkel has refused time and time again she will not bail them out if they declare bankruptcy. A major shift in liquidity heading back into US banks will surely spur a collapse. (Interestingly enough Trump owes Deutsche bank 300 million, he has a personal incentive to see them fail.)\n\nClimate aside the political elite in the EU know that, Paris deal or not, a Trump presidency will hurt them. This isn't on top of the fact that Trump seriously want's to increase EU spending on defense and essentially want's to pull out of NATO, or at the very least reduce the US's role. All these reason's are ultimately why Putin loves Trump also, Putin benefits the most from a weakened EU. \n\nThis is the EU telling the President-Elect that they have some political leverage to fight back.

This woman has rubella (German measles), but her favorite film star is in town, so she goes out, anyway, so she can see her. Unbeknownst to the fan, the actress is pregnant. She ends up giving birth to a baby with mental retardation, who's put in an institution. The doctors tell her that the child's condition is caused by exposure to rubella during pregnancy. \n\nShe never has another biological child. Her life is miserable and ruined. Then one day, she runs across the fan, who tells her the story of going to see her, not realizing that in doing so, she's telling her that she's the one who exposed her to rubella and hurt her unborn baby. The actress poisons her drink in revenge.\n\nThat story is why I fear rubella more than the other childhood diseases. It's also something I think about when I hear about people who *don't* vaccinate their children. It's not just about your kid. It's not just about you. Yes, there's a chance that your child will develop pneumonia and die, but that's your funeral expense, not mine. My concern (and most other people's) is that that sick child will expose other people to it, and that's not someone else's fucking right to do.

Terrorist attacks are foiled not by *collecting intelligence* but instead by *applying intelligence*.\n\nItaly has a long history of domestic terrorist, either political or from the Mafia. The experience of the Italian Police, Carabinieri and SISMI in counter terrorism is greater than any other western country. They don't collect massive amount of data, they instead operate around the concept that these attacks are politically motivated and they focus their attention in those areas. \n\n'Islamic' extremists are not going to rise from the local church youth group. The police will not waste resources with the surveillance of millions of targets that will not radicalise. This allows the most underfunded police force in Europe (relative to population and area) to foil every terrorist plan. \n\nI suggest you to check what happened in Venezia recently, in regards to the arrest of 3 terrorists that were about to hit Rialto in a similar way to the tragedy of Manchester.

The decision highlights the damage that the no-driving policy has done to the kingdom\u2019s international reputation and its hopes for a public relations benefit from the reform.\n\nSaudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam, is a Muslim monarchy ruled according to Shariah law. Saudi officials and clerics have provided numerous explanations for the ban over the years.\n\nSome said that it was inappropriate in Saudi culture for women to drive, or that male drivers would not know how to handle women in cars next to them. Others argued that allowing women to drive would lead to promiscuity and the collapse of the Saudi family. One cleric claimed \u2014 with no evidence \u2014 that driving harmed women\u2019s ovaries.\n\nRights groups have long campaigned for the ban to be overturned, and some women have been arrested and jailed for defying the prohibition and taking the wheel.\n\nBut the momentum to change the policy has picked up in recent years with the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, a 32-year-old son of the king who has laid out a far-reaching plan to overhaul the kingdom\u2019s economy and society.\n\nBeyond the effects it could have on Saudi Arabia\u2019s image abroad, letting women drive could help the Saudi economy.\n\nLow oil prices have limited the government jobs that many Saudis have long relied on, and the kingdom is trying to push more citizens, including women, into gainful employment. But some working Saudi women say hiring private drivers to get them to and from work eats up much of their pay, diminishing the incentive to work.\n\nIn recent years, many women have come to rely on ride-sharing apps like Uber and Careem to gain some freedom of movement.\n\nDespite the announcement, women will not be able to drive immediately. The kingdom has no infrastructure for women to learn to drive or to obtain drivers licenses. The police will need to be trained to interact with women in a way that they rarely do in a society where men and women who are not related rarely interact.\n\nBut many of the kingdom\u2019s professionals and young people will welcome the change, viewing it as a step to making life in the country a bit more like life elsewhere."}, {"comment_id": "dnjn884", "post_id": "72mkka", "comment": "Just realised Saudi arabia is only 87 years old"}, {"comment_id": "dnjoswi", "post_id": "72mkka", "comment": "Funny side-note, Bedouin women in Saudi do drive, even big trucks.

There's still a number of dirty tricks that could be tried.\n\nFor example: There has to be a driving exam of the person applying (obviously). The examiner has to have a license already (obviously). Women can only be examined by women (obvious in Saudi Arabia). Now just add a stipulation that all examiners must be born Saudi citizens and you've got a perfect Catch 22. (Incidentally, this is also why there are no Buddhist nuns in Thailand.)\n\nBut seriously, I don't expect them to make it impossible for women to get their license, just very, very hard."}, {"comment_id": "dnjnx3p", "post_id": "72mkka", "comment": "I'm Saudi and I'm so glad this is becoming a reality!\nAbout fucking time xD"}, {"comment_id": "dnjo9qc", "post_id": "72mkka", "comment": "One small step for the Salman, one giant leap for his country."}, {"comment_id": "dnkno92", "post_id": "72mkka", "comment": "Good.
