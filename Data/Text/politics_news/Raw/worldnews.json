Sanger and Matthew Rosenberg\n\nJuly 19, 2018\n\nJames B. Comey, James R. Clapper Jr. and John O. Brennan at a Senate hearing on Russia\u2019s election interference in January 2017.CreditAl Drago/The New York Times\n\nBy\u00a0David E. Sanger\u00a0and\u00a0Matthew Rosenberg\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 Two weeks before his inauguration, Donald J. Trump was shown highly classified intelligence indicating that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had personally ordered complex cyberattacks to sway the 2016 American election.\n\nThe evidence included texts and emails from Russian military officers and information gleaned from a top-secret source close to Mr. Putin, who had described to the C.I.A. how the Kremlin decided to execute its campaign of hacking and disinformation.\n\nMr. Trump sounded grudgingly convinced, according to several people who attended the intelligence briefing. But ever since, Mr. Trump has tried to cloud the very clear findings that he received on Jan. 6, 2017, which his own intelligence leaders have unanimously endorsed.\n\nThe shifting narrative underscores the degree to which Mr. Trump regularly picks and chooses intelligence to suit his political purposes. That has never been more clear than this week.\n\nOn Monday, standing next to the Russian president in Helsinki, Finland, Mr. Trump said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions. By Tuesday, faced with a bipartisan political outcry, Mr. Trump sought to walk back his words and sided with his intelligence agencies.\n\nOn Wednesday, when a reporter asked, \u201cIs Russia still targeting the U.S.?\u201d Mr. Trump shot back, \u201cNo\u201d \u2014 directly contradicting statements made only days earlier by his director of national intelligence, Dan Coats, who was sitting a few chairs away in the Cabinet Room. (The White House later said he was responding to a different question.)\n\nHours later, in a CBS News interview, Mr. Trump seemed to reverse course again. He blamed Mr. Putin personally, but only indirectly, for the election interference by Russia, \u201cbecause he\u2019s in charge of the country.\u201d\n\nIn the run-up to this week\u2019s ducking and weaving, Mr. Trump has done all he can to suggest other possible explanations for the hacks into the American political system. His fear, according to one of his closest aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity, is that any admission of even an unsuccessful Russian attempt to influence the 2016 vote raises questions about the legitimacy of his presidency.\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2017, meeting, held at Trump Tower, was a prime example. He was briefed that day by John O. Brennan, the C.I.A. director; James R. Clapper Jr., the director of national intelligence; and Adm. Michael S. Rogers, the director of the National Security Agency and the commander of United States Cyber Command.\n\nThe F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, was also there; after the formal briefing, he privately told Mr. Trump about the \u201cSteele dossier.\u201d That report, by a former British intelligence officer, included uncorroborated salacious stories of Mr. Trump\u2019s activities during a visit to Moscow, which he denied.\n\nAccording to nearly a dozen people who either attended the meeting with the president-elect or were later briefed on it, the four primary intelligence officials described the streams of intelligence that convinced them of Mr. Putin\u2019s role in the election interference.\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump on Jan. 6, 2017, the day he was briefed on cyberattacks designed to sway the 2016 American election.CreditSam Hodgson for The New York Times\n\nThey included stolen emails from the Democratic National Committee that had been seen in Russian military intelligence networks by the British, Dutch and American intelligence services. Officers of the\u00a0Russian intelligence agency formerly known as the G.R.U.\u00a0had plotted with groups like WikiLeaks on how to release the email stash.\n\nAnd ultimately, several human sources had confirmed Mr. Putin\u2019s own role.\n\nThat included one particularly valuable source, who was considered so sensitive that Mr. Brennan had declined to refer to it in any way in the Presidential Daily Brief during the final months of the Obama administration, as the Russia investigation intensified.\n\nInstead, to keep the information from being shared widely, Mr. Brennan sent reports from the source to Mr. Obama and a small group of top national security aides in a separate, white envelope to assure its security.\n\nMr. Trump and his aides were also given other reasons during the briefing to believe that Russia was behind the D.N.C. hacks.\n\nThe same Russian groups had been involved in cyberattacks on the State Department and White House unclassified email systems in 2014 and 2015, and in an attack on the Joint Chiefs of Staff. They had aggressively fought the N.S.A. against being ejected from the White House system, engaging in what the deputy director of the agency later called \u201chand-to-hand combat\u201d to dig in.\n\nThe pattern of the D.N.C. hacks, and the theft of emails from John D. Podesta, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign chairman, fit the same pattern.\n\nAfter the briefings, Mr. Trump issued a statement later that day that sought to spread the blame for the meddling. He said \u201cRussia, China and other countries, outside groups and countries\u201d were launching cyberattacks against American government, businesses and political organizations \u2014 including the D.N.C.\n\nStill, Mr. Trump said in his statement, \u201cthere was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.\u201d\n\nMr. Brennan later told Congress that he had no doubt where the attacks were coming from.\n\n\u201cI was convinced in the summer that the Russians were trying to interfere in the election,\u201d he said in testimony in May 2017. \u201cAnd they were very aggressive.\u201d\n\nFor Mr. Trump, the messengers were as much a part of the problem as the message they delivered.\n\nMr. Brennan and Mr. Clapper were both Obama administration appointees who left the government the day Mr. Trump was inaugurated. The new president soon took to portraying them as political hacks who had warped the intelligence to provide Democrats with an excuse for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s loss in the election.\n\nMr. Comey fared little better. He was fired in May 2017 after refusing to pledge his loyalty to Mr. Trump and pushing forward on the federal investigation into whether the Trump campaign had cooperated with Russia\u2019s election interference.\n\nOnly Admiral Rogers, who retired this past May, was extended in office by Mr. Trump. (He, too, told Congress that he thought the evidence of Russian interference was incontrovertible.)\n\nPresident Trump, meeting with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland, on Monday, said he accepted Mr. Putin\u2019s denial of Russian election intrusions.CreditDoug Mills/The New York Times\n\nAnd the evidence suggests Russia continues to be very aggressive in its meddling.\n\nIn March, the Department of Homeland Security\u00a0declared that Russia was\u00a0targeting the American electric power grid, continuing to riddle it with malware that could be used to manipulate or shut down critical control systems. Intelligence officials have described it to Congress as a chief threat to American security.\n\nJust last week, Mr. Coats said that current cyberthreats were \u201cblinking red\u201d and called Russia the \u201cmost aggressive foreign actor, no question.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd they continue their efforts to undermine our democracy,\u201d he said.\n\nChristopher A. Wray, the F.B.I. director, also stood firm.\n\n\u201cThe intelligence community\u2019s assessment has not changed,\u201d Mr. Wray said on Wednesday at the Aspen Security Forum. \u201cMy view has not changed, which is that Russia attempted to interfere with the last election and continues to engage in malign influence operations to this day.\u201d\n\nThe Russian efforts are \u201caimed at sowing discord and divisiveness in this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cWe haven\u2019t yet seen an effort to target specific election infrastructure this time. We could be just a moment away from the next level.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a threat we need to take extremely seriously and respond to with fierce determination and focus.\u201d\n\nAlmost as soon as he took office, Mr. Trump began casting doubts on the intelligence on Russia\u2019s election interference, though never taking issue with its specifics.\n\nHe dismissed it broadly as a fabrication by Democrats and part of a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him. He raised unrelated issues, including the state of investigations into Mrs. Clinton\u2019s home computer server, to distract attention from the central question of Russia\u2019s role \u2014 and who, if anyone, in Mr. Trump\u2019s immediate orbit may have worked with them.\n\nIn July 2017, just after meeting Mr. Putin for the first time, Mr. Trump told a New York Times reporter that the Russian president had made a persuasive case that Moscow\u2019s cyberskills were so good that the government\u2019s hackers would never have been caught. Therefore, Mr. Trump recounted from his conversation with Mr. Putin, Russia must not have been responsible.\n\nSince then, Mr. Trump has routinely disparaged the intelligence about the Russian election interference. Under public pressure \u2014 as he was after his statements in Helsinki on Monday \u2014 he has periodically retreated. But even then, he has expressed confidence in his intelligence briefers, not in the content of their findings.\n\nThat is what happened again this week, twice.\n\nMr. Trump\u2019s statement in Helsinki led Mr. Coats to reaffirm, in a statement he deliberately did not get cleared at the White House, that American intelligence agencies had no doubt that Russia was behind the 2016 hack.\n\nThat contributed to Mr. Trump\u2019s decision on Tuesday to say that he had misspoken one word, and that he did believe Russia had interfered \u2014 although he also veered off script to declare: \u201cCould be other people also. A lot of people out there.\u201d\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "e2naskf", "post_id": "901p5f", "comment": "\u201cIn March, the Department of Homeland Security declared that Russia was targeting the American electric power grid,\u201d\n\nholy fuck.

The source wanted neither financial compensation nor anything else in return, apart from a few security measures.\n\nThe data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows.

The thugs tied up the security guards, doused them in gasoline, lit a match and threatened to set them afire unless they opened the warehouse\u2019s vault. Inside, the thieves found nearly 7,000 gold bars, diamonds and cash.\n\n\u201cThanks ever so much for your help. Have a nice Christmas,\u201d one of the crooks said as they departed.\n\nBritish media dubbed the heist the \u201cCrime of the Century.\u201d Much of the loot - including the cash reaped by melting the gold and selling it - was never recovered. Where the missing money went is a mystery that continues to fascinate students of England\u2019s underworld.\n\nNow documents within Mossack Fonseca\u2019s files reveal that the law firm and its co-founder, J\u00fcrgen Mossack, may have helped the conspirators keep the spoils out of the hands of authorities by protecting a company tied to Gordon Parry, a London wheeler-dealer who laundered money for the Brink\u2019s-Mat plotters.\n\n On Feb. 10, 2011, an anonymous company in the British Virgin Islands named Sandalwood Continental Ltd. loaned $200 million to an equally shadowy firm based in Cyprus called Horwich Trading Ltd.\n\nThe following day, Sandalwood assigned the rights to collect payments on the loan - including interest - to Ove Financial Corp., a mysterious company in the British Virgin Islands.\n\nFor those rights, Ove paid $1.\n\nBut the money trail didn\u2019t end there.\n\nThe same day, Ove reassigned its rights to collect on the loan to a Panama company called International Media Overseas.\n\nIt too paid $1.\n\nIn the space of 24 hours the loan had, on paper, traversed three countries, two banks and four companies, making the money all but untraceable in the process.\n\nFamily members of at least eight current or former members of China\u2019s Politburo Standing Committee, the country\u2019s main ruling body, have offshore companies arranged though Mossack Fonseca. They include President Xi\u2019s brother-in-law, who set up two British Virgin Islands companies in 2009.\n\nThe leaked files show the firm regularly offered to backdate documents to help its clients gain advantage in their financial affairs. It was so common that in 2007 an email exchange shows firm employees talking about establishing a price structure - clients would pay $8.75 for each month farther back in time that a corporate document would be backdated.\n\nThe world\u2019s best soccer player, Lionel Messi, is also found in the documents. The records show Messi and his father were owners of a Panama company: Mega Star Enterprises Inc. This adds a new name to the list of shell companies known to be linked to Messi. His offshore dealings are currently the target of a tax evasion case in Spain.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "d1ojm8z", "post_id": "4d75i7", "comment": "Look at the fear on his face:\nhttps://embed.theguardian.com/embed/video/world/video/2016/apr/03/icelands-prime-minister-walks-out-of-interview-over-tax-haven-question-video"}, {"comment_id": "d1oj76g", "post_id": "4d75i7", "comment": "Interesting about the gold heist."}, {"comment_id": "d1ok7pm", "post_id": "4d75i7", "comment": "This shit reads like an international crime novel, but it's real fuckin life.

This will be a huge hit for several large figures in world sports, politics and economy. Names like Lionel messi, Vladimir Putin and the prime minister of Iceland are already leaked.

As op linked to\n\nBefore reading further: \nHere is a nice ELI5 of shell company procedures and how they work written by /u/Jaredlong:\n\n>Taxes sure do suck, right? Imagine how much money you could keep if you simply didn't pay them. Generally, for businesses, they only pay taxes on their profits, so what if you could hide some of those profits from the government? After all, they can only tax money they can prove exists. One method for lowering profits, is to ncrease spending, by re-investing in the company, making higher quality products, maybe even paying your employees more, OR you can \"spend\" that extra profit buying fake services from a fake company. What has been happening in Panama is a company has been selling these fake businesses, that corporations then use to make massive fake transactions. Officially, the taxman sees money flowing into these fake businesses, but now we all know for a fact that those fake businesses are in fact fake. This accounts for potentially several trillions of dollars worth of money that should have been taxed, but has been illegally hidden.\n\n*pls note that this is a subjective ELI5 and there are indeed some reasons/scenarios where shell companies operate for legit reasons!

He is possessed of an uncanny ability to induce self-revelation, stroking and feeding the ego until it swells up and bursts. And nobody\u2019s ego is bigger than Donald Trump\u2019s, the bloviating New York real-estate baron turned bumbling politician. The two lascivious man-children were a match made in shock-jock heaven (or is it hell?), with each successive boast offering peeks into the Donald\u2019s damaged psyche.\n\nThe Stern-Trump interviews, spread out over 35 on-air appearances between 1993 and 2015\u2014and totaling around 15 hours\u2014came back to bite candidate Trump a bit during the campaign. First revisited by yours truly at The Daily Beast\u2014and later to far more consequential effect by ace reporters Andrew Kaczynski and Nathan McDermott, of BuzzFeed and CNN\u2014the Stern interviews saw Trump at his crudest and most unguarded, whether it was objectifying his daughter Ivanka or, in a moment that haunted him during the presidential debates, confessing that he initially supported the invasion of Iraq.\n\n\u201cThis is who Trump is,\u201d said Stern of the 45th president. \u201cHe was always bombastic. He always rated women. He always talked in a misogynistic, sexist kind of way, but he did it sort of proudly and out in the open.\u201d\n\nThis week, Bill Frischling over at Factbl.og dove in to the Howard Stern Show archives and uploaded all of the Stern-Trump interviews online. While the most shocking bits had already been mined by reporters in the lead-up to his surprise election victory, some new Trump information came to light, from his bizarre idea on how to combat airline terrorists (\u201cthe pilot\u2026 presses a button and sleeping gas comes out\u201d) to telling Stern he hosted a fundraiser for Hillary Clinton prior to the 2008 Democratic primary to opening up about his and Melania\u2019s sex life.\n\nOn an April 16, 2004, interview with Stern, Trump shares that he turned down several reality-show offers because \u201cI didn\u2019t want to have anybody watch me comb my hair,\u201d while in an interview conducted on Feb. 27, 2006, Donald, Ivanka, and Don. Jr. can\u2019t figure out the answer to what 17 x 6 is. \u201c96? 94?\u201d offers Don Jr. \u201cThat\u2019s not a practical application, though,\u201d adds Ivanka, refusing the question. \u201cIt\u2019s 112,\u201d chimes in Donald, who repeatedly insists that the answer is 112. If that weren\u2019t enough, on no less than 10 occasions Trump shares the exact same story from his star-studded wedding to Marla Maples, with Stern telling reporters \u201cthere wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the house\u201d and \u201cI give it six months\u201d\u2014comments that Trump cheerfully claims left Maples in tears on their wedding night.\n\nThe most eye-opening story from the unearthed Stern-Trump interviews, however, came during a chat on July 16, 2008.\n\nTrump, a notorious germaphobe, is discussing his extreme distaste for blood. The mere sight of it, he says, causes him to recoil in disgust. Perhaps it explains why he accused then Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly of having her period after she asked him a tough question during a presidential debate, or why he sought multiple deferments to dodge the Vietnam War.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not good for medical. In other words, if you cut your finger and there\u2019s blood pouring out, I\u2019m gone,\u201d he told Stern.\n\nThe former reality-TV host then shares a story with Stern about the time he thought a man died in front of him during a charity event at his Palm Beach club Mar-a-Lago and, rather than helping the injured man, Trump turned away in disgust at the sight of his blood.\n\n\u201cI was at Mar-a-Lago and we had this incredible ball, the Red Cross Ball, in Palm Beach, Florida. And we had the Marines. And the Marines were there, and it was terrible because all these rich people, they\u2019re there to support the Marines, but they\u2019re really there to get their picture in the Palm Beach Post\u2026 so you have all these really rich people, and a man, about 80 years old\u2014very wealthy man, a lot of people didn\u2019t like him\u2014he fell off the stage,\u201d said Trump.\n\nTrump proceeds to explain that it was a $100,000-per-table fundraiser filled with deep-pocketed billionaires, and that the Marines were\u2014for whatever reason\u2014given tables in the very back of the ballroom (\u201cthe worst table in the whole place\u201d). Oh, and that he was more preoccupied with his ballroom\u2019s pristine marble floor than the octogenarian bleeding out on it.\n\n\u201cSo what happens is, this guy falls off right on his face, hits his head, and I thought he died. And you know what I did? I said, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s disgusting,\u2019 and I turned away,\u201d said Trump. \u201cI couldn\u2019t, you know, he was right in front of me and I turned away. I didn\u2019t want to touch him\u2026 he\u2019s bleeding all over the place, I felt terrible. You know, beautiful marble floor, didn\u2019t look like it. It changed color. Became very red. And you have this poor guy, 80 years old, laying on the floor unconscious, and all the rich people are turning away. \u2018Oh my God! This is terrible! This is disgusting!\u2019 and you know, they\u2019re turning away. Nobody wants to help the guy. His wife is screaming\u2014she\u2019s sitting right next to him, and she\u2019s screaming.\u201d\n\nThank God for the Marines. \u201cWhat happens is, these 10 Marines from the back of the room\u2026 they come running forward, they grab him, they put the blood all over the place\u2014it\u2019s all over their uniforms\u2014they\u2019re taking it, they\u2019re swiping [it], they ran him out, they created a stretcher. They call it a human stretcher, where they put their arms out with, like, five guys on each side,\u201d shared Trump.\n\n\u201cI was saying, \u2018Get that blood cleaned up! It\u2019s disgusting!\u2019 The next day, I forgot to call [the man] to say he\u2019s OK,\u201d said Trump, adding of the blood, \u201cIt\u2019s just not my thing.\u201d"}, {"comment_id": "e9fwwrw", "post_id": "9vw2w3", "comment": ">This president (...) the biggest (...) of all time.\n\nThey call me the biggest president of all time, THE BIGGEST.

I've lived in places in the middle east where the internet was not free and open. Where access was granted and denied at the whim of other people and you know what? It's fucking awful.\n\nNow, the scope of what I am talking about is in many ways different from what the FCC is talking about here. It's not nearly as bad, however, I feel like there are some relevant crossovers to mention.\n\nFirst of all, since there were no laws or policies in place to protect the customer, internet companies could basically do whatever the hell they wanted. Do you know why? Because they are basically owned by the state they operate in. 68% of Ooredoo is owned by the state of Qatar, Etisalat; the 14th largest mobile network operator in the world 60% of it owned by the UAE. So here is some shit they can pull. And this isn't just a problem in the middle eastern gulf, this happens in all kinds of places in the middle east that do not necessarily practise censorship.\n\nFirst of all, they absolutely throttle your access to certain online services. For example, teamspeak. This is such a thing in certain countries it is hilarious. Teamspeak is a VOIP application for gamers yet for whatever reason, there are certain places where you just cannot use it. You will find yourself being throttled for the seemingly most random things and you will never know why. This is literally the kind of thing net neutrality protects us all from. Your ISP doesn't like the fact that a lot of people are using discord or netflix for example? Throttle the shit out of it or charge a shit ton of money. Oh this is the best one. ETISALAT LITERALLY BLOCKS MESSENGER, VIBER AND ALL OTHER VOIP SERVICES. Why? So that people can only use their own mobile network to call overseas. It is literally the most annoying thing ever. I cannot call my family in the UAE on messenger or any of those services because it is literally blocked so that they have to pay money to call on the regular phone network. What is to stop companies like Verizon or Comcast from doing this??\n\nCensorship. Now yes, nothing about this FCC decision will come into the realm of censorship eh? But how can you be so sure? The fact that companies like ooreedoo and etisilat are primarily owned by the state, means that they have blocked all immoral content; porn websites, hell even things that aren't even porn but have someone dressed in a lewd manner. They have blocked any site that critiques their governments, sexual health resources for pete's sake, dating services etc.\n\nWill there ever come a day where now that net neutrality has been done away with where partisan congress members can push for the restriction of sexual health services for example because it goes against their ideals? I mean what is to say that there won't be any collusion between government representatives and internet providers over the semantics of what is subject to heavier prices, access or restrictions?\n\nThis is of course assuming the worst, but we cannot pretend that people will not try to use this to their advantage. Not to mention that this pigeon holes people's free access to so many things. Let's say I am writing a paper for school and reach my limit for a certain database, website or whatever it may be. Then what? Am I supposed to move on to more sanctioned resources that I will have longer access to? Why? Why can't I just use what I want. What if I am an alcoholic and I come to reddit everyday because I am part of a support community. What will happen once I cannot come back here to talk to my community and I cannot afford to \"unlock reddit\".\n\nI try my best to see any redeeming qualities of doing away with net neutrality but I have already experienced the very bare minimum of it minus the censorship and it actually fucking sucks.\n\nI am so thankful and privileged to have become a Canadian and to now be living in Canada. Sometimes we cannot really visualise just exactly how good we have it until we experience it about 1000 times worse.

The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!\nIt sounds great but;\n1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!\n2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing.

The diversity between the two major political parties in this country is worse than ever. Politicians don't care to better this country for all, they only care about their team having the most points. It's a disgusting way to live and it hurts all of us. This current issue is only the most recent disgrace to come to the attention of Congress to pass through. There is no advantage to giving a handful of major ISP companies the right to extort money for access to the internet. There are countries that have free internet service and there are countries that consider internet access a basic human right these days. The United States won't even consider water a basic human necessity, for the sake of a company that won't spare any expense to make more money.\n\nRepealing Net Neutrality is just handing the keys to a daycare center to a famously aggressive and unsympathetic bully.

Net Neutrality isn't even the beginning, but with every selfish law being passed that puts the boot to the necks of the citizens, we find ourselves inching closer to the end. This once great country may not even survive another ten years. I can barely see the light of hope in the darkness that grows greater every day.\n\nIf this law passes, and we the people are subject to the whims of a few greedy businesses, you may as well change \u201cWe the People\u201d to \u201cWe the Corporations.\u201d\n\nFor the love of decency, for the sake of a brighter future, for the chance that future generations may transform our country into a great nation once again, I beg you to see reason.

I didn't bother spell-checking too much.\n\n>Dear Congressmen.\n\nI write to you deeply concerned as a politically inactive person. But you have finally managed to activate me. Congratulations. Your recent proposal to deregulate and repeal \"Net-neutrality\" has left me questioning whether your fully comprehend the magnitude and responsibility of the office which you possess.\n\nThe Internet has been developed from being a secondary medium for search and information in its earlier days to being the far way foremost medium and source for information / communication. \nThe free flow of information and the right to freely share knowledge / information is paramount to every society. It connects to both freedom of speech which is already fundamentally secured in the constitution but also to the mutual trust we each have in society as a whole. Trust is the oil of the engine that is the economy. Without it, I may hesitate and abstain from making a certain transaction thus promoting inertia in the economy. Trust is built by relations, communication, information, accountability and a well-functioning (and somewhat fast) justice system. Prohibiting the free flow of information simply put, limits trust. In essence, you are transferring the right to a free flow of information as a law/constitutional right to instead being chosen by companies. However as is evident in several recent leaks of tax havens and WikiLeaks, the interest of companies may deeply conflict with the interest of the common good. \n\nYou may be right, that nothing may happen when you require the corporations to report their policies. But you may also be very wrong. As a technically educated person I can safely say that many things can be done, hidden beneath heaps of code, that are extremely hard to reveal/check without compromising intellectual property. It would essentially require them to supply their whole code-base for checking which would be prone to theft of intellectual property. That would be neither be satisfactory for the consumer nor the corporation. \n\nIf it is your intention to rely solely on the good intentions of large internet providers and not check their codebase in it's entirety then history through many examples across a variety of industries that this approach is frankly naive. As elected member of the US Congress you are guardians of the Constitution, lawmakers and protectors of the people.

I ***firmly*** believe that the only reason this is uncertain at all is because the law hasn't kept up.  If made aware, its more than likely that legislators would specifically cover loot box systems in the Act.\n\nWhat is ***fucking outrageous***:  I know *for a fact* that winnings from loot boxes are **technically** taxable under the Income Tax Act, in rare and specific circumstances.  This would only be the case if you:\n\n1. sold the prizes for a profit; AND\n2. had a \"system\" to reliably make a profit (as opposed to simply having a lucky streak).\n\nThis also means that losses (buying duds) would be tax deductible.\n\nHow can something like this be caught by tax laws but not by gambling laws?\n\nI emailed the New Zealand Gambling Commission last week, and will call if I don't get a response soon.  I will be notifying the incumbent government too and see if we can't get some legislative clarity.\n\nI think everyone should do the same for their countries (contact the gambling authority and the legislators).

Now, I am not deleting my facebook account. Facebook is a tool that I like.\n\nI am on my alternate account, and the reason is, I am kind of \"in industry\". I work with clients who use facebook and other tools to advertise.\n\nIt's important to note that this plugin doesn't really solve the whole \"Cambridge Analytica\" thing. That cat is already out of the bag. That data is out there. There was a great article on the atlantic (https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/arch that kind of explained what happened there. Essentially, back in the the early facebook days, they were trying to establish an ecosystem of apps. These were things like iq tests,games, etc, but also included things like registering for a third party website. When you installed one of those apps, you gave facebook permission to give that 3rd party your information. Once it was given, there is no way to get it back.That was things like your school, your contact information and your friends. When facebook transitioned to mobile first, that \"installing apps\" thing kind of stopped. The extension does nothing to solve this problem.\n\nNow, there is another dimension, which is facebook tracking on pages that aren't facebook. This used to be commonly done with \"share on facebook buttons\". Now, it's a lot less transparent. It is very commonly set up so that when you visit a site, facebook knows. Then, someone can target you with an ad on facebook based on that information. For example, you go to a tee-shirt store. You don't buy the tee shirt. And, then you go on facebook and see an ad for that teeshirt. I believe this is what the plugin is designed to solve.\n\nAnother thing that facebook does is it takes lists from other people. You load the lists in, and then facebook can do a few things. It can serve ads to those people. But, it can also find people who are similar to those people. And then it can serve ads based on either of those. So in the t-shirt example, if someone visits the store and makes a purchase. You can take a list of all those people, load it into facebook and find other people who look similar. Then, serve ads to those people. This extension does nothing to fix this. \n\nMost of the actual advertising that is done with facebook is actually on one of their properties (basically instagram and facebook). I believe that facebook has some ability to serve ads off facebook, but I have actually heard very little about it. Theoretically, this extension would help, but Google really dominates that market. So, this would be a drop in the bucket. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dwdyvoq", "post_id": "87icwb", "comment": "I find it hilarious Facebook is officially being treated as malware needing containment...which it basically is."}, {"comment_id": "dwe0c3t", "post_id": "87icwb", "comment": "Well sorry chrome, looks like I\u2019m switching to the fox "}, {"comment_id": "dwe0pyf", "post_id": "87icwb", "comment": "So current setup is now \n\n- uBlock origin\n\n- EFF Privacy Badger\n\n- Decentraleyes\n\n- Firefox Containers\n\n- Canvas Defender\n\nJesus fuck, cant someone just make a firefox fork with all of this in natively?

He was just the safest pick. Harper was doing some weird stuff that should have been illegal but wasn't due to our Charter of Rights and Freedoms being vague about what supercedes it. \n\nAfterthoughts: I wrote radical because it's a powerful word. I chose it because what I think that needs to change requires ALOT of effort. Its not just political, its cultural. We as a society have this mentality that one's worth is directly tied to our career. While many other Western cultures define one's worth by how they enrich their community through their work, actions, and inactions. To me, our culture is fundamentally flawed in how we treat one another. \n\nA banker is respected, regardless of how terrible they are here. Even if they made money off of people literally losing their homes, they still get access to a VIP lifestyle and their voice is worth more than ours, because they have money. The greatest teachers in our lives go unappreciated by the larger culture, because they don't have these connections and cash. In fact, we complain about their benefits, wages and how they get summers off, yet the banker who took your house gets a \"Fuck that guy\" and then everyone just kind of forgets, in favour of attacking welfare recipients, firefighters, teachers, tradesmen, wearhouse workers, factory workers... \n\n I know this goes deeper, and I know that much of it has to do with the rich and connected, but we can't blame everything on the other. We are all responsible. Like I said, even our inactions can enrich or hurt our communities. So, I would like to see a PM who understands that. Who actually pushes for real change, and doesn't just ride the wave that was made by people who have sacrificed so much, many of whom will go unnamed and unknown to history. I voted for Trudeau because he wouldn't break the wave, but I'm not naive.
