I'll be updating it as this story develops, but for anyone looking for a primer on the case:\n____\n\n**The Short Version** \n\nBasically, Jeffrey Epstein was ([possibly](https://www.forbes.com/sites/clareoconnor/2011/02/28/jeffrey-epstein-sex-offender-yes-billionaire-no/#7e5b7a96422e)) a billionaire hedge fund manager who was (definitely) a child sex offender who has long been rumoured to have done some frankly appalling things with children: production of child pornography, rape, trafficking of minors... it's a whole fuckin' list. The net has been closing in on him for a while, and he took a plea deal in Florida earlier this year on similar charges and spent thirteen months in a very low-security jail, but he was arrested in Manhattan last month after the plea deal was found to have broken federal law. This is a *big deal*, not only because it would be one of the highest-profile child sex crime prosecutions in years, but also because of Epstein's rumoured (and not-so-rumoured) personal relationships with politicians on both sides of the aisle. It's also important because one of the most prominent allegations against Epstein directly involves Donald Trump, as well as regular Trump supporter (and Epstein's possibly-former lawyer) Alan Dershowitz.\n\nAfter an alleged suicide attempt three weeks ago, in which Epstein was found with injuries to his neck that were reported to have been self-inflicted, Epstein was found dead in his cell on the morning of August 10th.\n\nThis is all a *big deal*.\n\n**A Little History**\n\nJeffrey Epstein was rich, and very well-connected. (The two things are, as you might expect, inextricably linked.) His net worth wasn't known, but most estimates put it in the single-figure billions. Epstein was famous for being... let's be generous and say 'eccentric', and his behaviour was often at odds with what's expected for someone of his standing. Even the details of what he did for a living aren't well known. A *New Yorker* article from 2002 [quoted several people on the topic](http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/n_7912/):\n\n>\u201cMy belief is that Jeff maintains some sort of money-management firm, though you won\u2019t get a straight answer from him,\u201d says one well-known investor. \u201cHe once told me he had 300 people working for him, and I\u2019ve also heard that he manages Rockefeller money. But one never knows. It\u2019s like looking at the Wizard of Oz \u2013 there may be less there than meets the eye.\u201d\n\n>Says another prominent Wall Streeter: \u201cHe is this mysterious, Gatsbyesque figure. He likes people to think that he is very rich, and he cultivates this air of aloofness. The whole thing is weird.\u201d\n\nAt one point, he was rumoured to spend some 600 hours in the air every year -- the equivalent of over three weeks in a plane -- examining 'business opportunities' (per the *New Yorker* article). However, one thing that *was* known about Epstein is that -- for all of his claims of being quiet, not drinking and never taking drugs -- he was (depending on your definition) in the inner-circle of some high-profile individuals, including [the UK's Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton, Woody Allen, Katie Couric, Kevin Spacey, Tom Barrack, and Donald Trump.](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article221897990.html)\n\nBoth of these things will be important later.\n\n#Rumours\n\nEpstein's name has long been associated with paedophilia, with complaints going back at least as far as 2005 that he was abusing girls as young as 14 in his Palm Beach Mansion. Accusations at the time suggested that Epstein was paying girls for sexually-suggestive massages, but over time more and more complaints rolled in. A investigation was brought about, and the FBI found strong evidence that Epstein had engaged in activities with girls under the age of 18 -- or, let's not put too fine a point on it here, child sexual abuse.\n\nThis is when things get a bit fucky.\n\nIn 2008 Epstein was offered what was reported in the media as the deal of a lifetime: in short, he would agree to agree to plead guilty to state prostitution charges, register as a sex offender, and pay restitution to three dozen victims identified by the FBI. His guilty plea resulted in a sentence of 18 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach County jail (which later became 13 months and a year of parole), with a private security team and 12 hours of 'work release', six days a week, where he was abl to go to his offices. In return, the government agreed to grant immunity from all federal criminal charges -- and consider that the FBI recommended pursuing charges of four counts of unlawful sex with minors and one count of molestation -- along with four co-conspirators and any unnamed 'potential co-conspirators'. For a year and a half in jail (well, 'in jail'), Epstein ensured that anyone else involved in his crimes would go untroubled. The indictment (all 53 pages of it) was sealed, preventing the details from becoming public.\n\nThe prosecutor who made this deal -- which was widely slammed in the press as unjust -- was Alexander Acosta, Secretary of Labor in the Trump Administration (until he was forced out as a result of the negative attention, a couple of days after the story broke). His legal team included Alan Dershowitz, and (lead investigator in the Clinton impeachment) Ken Starr.\n\n**A Hell of a Deal... Overturned**\n\nEpstein got out of jail, but the accusations kept coming. None of them are what you'd call pleasant to read, but more and more of them accused not only Epstein of horrific sexual abuses, but also high-profile friends of his. Consider the fact that some of these accusations included Prince Andrew, Bill Clinton and Donald Trump, and you realise that you're talking about a *big fuckin' deal* if any of this stuff ever gets corroborated. Also consider that the FBI found cameras all over Epstein's house, suggesting that he was using them to create blackmail material for high-profile guests at his at-the-very-least-statutory rape parties. (Thanks to the sealed indictment, that can only be speculative.) These accusations continued, and led to some lawsuits, several of which were settled out-of-court by Epstein. The most famous one emerged just before the 2016 elections: I'll let [*PBS Newshour*](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/assault-allegations-donald-trump-recapped) take this one, without further comment:\n\n>**\u201cJane Doe\u201d aka \u201cKatie Johnson\u201d \u2013 1994.** Lawsuit filed June 2016, refiled October 2016 as reported by Buzzfeed and others, then dropped in November 2016.    \nJane Doe is an unnamed plaintiff, who has also gone by \u201cKatie Johnson\u201d in legal papers. She claims she was repeatedly raped by Trump and Jeffery Epstein at Epstein\u2019s New York City apartment in 1994, when she was 13 years old. A witness, also given a pseudonym \u2014 \u201cTiffany Doe\u201d \u2014 said she recruited \u201cJane Doe\u201d and others. Doe, using the name \u201cJohnson,\u201d gave an interview to the *Daily Mail* in which she said she did not know who Trump was at the time of the alleged attack but identified him later when she saw him on television. It is not known why she withdrew the lawsuit. She has not spoken publicly or withdrawn her rape allegation since then.\n\n(To clarify, this is not one of the cases that was known to be settled out of court by Epstein; Katie Johnson's reasons for dropping the lawsuit are unknown at this time.)\n\nNow, let's not mince words here: Epstein and his lawyers did whatever they could to get him the lowest possible sentence and hide his crimes from public scrutinty. Even Alexander Acosta noted that Epstein's lawyers had gone to unusual lengths to get what they wanted:\n\n>Acosta explained in a 2011 letter that he allowed for Epstein\u2019s short sentence after \u201ca year-long assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors\u201d by the financier\u2019s \u201carmy of legal superstars.\u201d\n\n>\u201cThe defense strategy was not limited to legal issues,\u201d Acosta wrote. \u201cDefense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and their families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may provide a basis for disqualification.\u201d \n\nHowever, earlier this year a Florida court found that Acosta's team had violated federal law when they failed to disclose Mr. Epstein\u2019s nonprosecution agreement to his victims. (This investigation was sparked by a major investigation by the *Miami Herald* into [accusations against Epstein](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article220097825.html); it's well worth a read, if Spotlight-style journalism is your thing.) The judge's 33-page opinion goes into [intense detail](https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000169-11f3-d0be-adfb-75fff4490000) on the question -- it's not always an easy read, but there it is -- but basically he declined to overturn Epstein's plea deal (which would have been a *huge* deal), and instead granted the defence 15 days to renegotiate a settlement. (As the *Miami Herald* noted: ['Epstein\u2019s victims were not told the case was closed until it was too late for them to appear at his sentencing and possibly upend the deal', which was a violation of the Crime Victims\u2019 Rights Act](https://www.miamiherald.com/news/state/florida/article226577419.html).)\n\n**More on the story's recent developments, on Dershowitz, and on what this might mean in the near future [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/cohqmr/jeffrey_epstein_accused_sex_trafficker_dies_by/ewic8ic/).**"}, {"comment_id": "ewi9acf", "post_id": "cohqmr", "comment": "Well well well...

It has to do with McCain\u2019s military background and Vietnam combat and the five-plus years he spent in a North Vietnamese prison, mostly in solitary, in a box, getting tortured and starved. And the unbelievable honor and balls he showed there. \n\nIt's very easy to gloss over the POW thing, partly because we've all heard so much about it and partly because it\u2019s so off-the \u2013 charts dramatic, like something in a movie instead of a man's life. But it\u2019s worth considering for a minute, because it\u2019s what makes McCain's \"causes greater than self-interest\" line easier to hear.\n\nYou probably already know what happened. \n\nIn October of '67 McCain was himself still a Young Voter and \ufb02ying his 23rd Vietnam combat mission and his A-4 Skyhawk plane got shot down over Hanoi and he had to eject, which basically means setting off an explosive charge that blows your seat out of the plane, which ejection broke both McCain's arms and one leg and gave him a concussion and he started falling out of the skies right over Hanoi. \n\nTry to imagine for a second how much this would hurt and how scared you'd be, three limbs broken and falling toward the enemy capital you just tried to bomb. His chute opened late and he landed hard in a little lake in a park right in the middle of downtown Hanoi, \n\nImagine treading water with broken arms and trying to pull the life vest's toggle with your teeth as a crowd of Vietnamese men swim out toward you (there's film of this, somebody had a home \u2013 movie camera, and the N.V. government released it, though it's grainy and McCain's face is hard to see). The crowd pulled him out and then just about killed him. \n\nU.S. bomber pilots were especially hated, for obvious reasons. McCain got bayoneted in the groin; a soldier broke his shoulder apart with a ri\ufb02e butt. Plus by this time his right knee was bent 90-degrees to the side with the bone sticking out. Try to imagine this. \n\nHe finally got tossed on a jeep and taken five blocks to the infamous Hoa Lo prison \u2013 a.k.a. the \"Hanoi Hilton,\" of much movie fame \u2013 where they made him beg a week for a doctor and finally set a couple of the fractures without anesthetic and let two other fractures and the groin wound (imagine: groin wound) stay like they were. Then they threw him in a cell. Try for a moment to feel this. All the media profiles talk about how McCain still can't lift his arms over his head to comb his hair, which is true. \n\nBut try to imagine it at the time, yourself in his place, because it's important. Think about how diametrically opposed to your own self-interest getting knifed in the balls and having fractures set without painkiller would be, and then about getting thrown in a cell to just lie there and hurt, which is what happened. \n\nHe was delirious with pain for weeks, and his weight dropped to 100 pounds, and the other POWs were sure he would die; and then after a few months like that after his bones mostly knitted and he could sort of stand up they brought him in to the prison commandant's office and offered to let him go. This is true. They said he could just leave. They had found out that McCain's father was one of the top-ranking naval officers in the U.S. Armed Forces (which is true \u2013 both his father and grandfather were admirals), and the North Vietnamese wanted the PR coup of mercifully releasing his son, the baby-killer. \n\nMcCain, 100 pounds and barely able to stand, refused, The U.S. military's Code of Conduct for Prisoners of War apparently said that POWs had to be released in the order they were captured, and there were others who'd been in Hoa Lo a long time, and McCain refused to violate the Code. \n\nThe commandant, not pleased, right there in the office had guards break his ribs, rebreak his arm, knock his teeth out. McCain still refused to leave without the other POWs. And so then he spent four more years in Hoa Lo like this, much of the time in solitary, in the dark, in a closet-sized box called a \"punishment cell.\" \n\nMaybe you've heard all this before; it's been in umpteen different media profiles of McCain. But try to imagine that moment between getting offered early release and turning it down. Try to imagine it was you. \n\nImagine how loudly your most basic, primal self-interest would have cried out to you in that moment, and all the ways you could rationalize accepting the offer. Can you hear it? It so, would you have refused to go? You simply can't know for sure. None of us can. It's hard even to imagine the pain and fear in that moment, much less know how you'd react. \n\nBut, see, we do know how this man reacted. That he chose to spend four more years there, in a dark box, alone, tapping code on the walls to the others, rather than violate a Code. Maybe he was nuts. But the point is that with McCain it feels like we know, for a proven fact, that he\u2019s capable of devotion to something other, more, than his own self-interest. So that when he says the line in speeches in early February you can feel like maybe it isn't just more candidate bullshit, that with this guy it's maybe the truth.\n\nOr maybe both the truth and bullshit: the guy does \u2013 did \u2013 want your vote, after all.\n\nBut that moment in the Hoa Lo office in '68 \u2013 right before he refused, with all his basic normal human self-interest howling at him \u2013 that moment is hard to blow off.\"\n\nFrom Rolling Stone \nby David Foster Wallace, 2000"}, {"comment_id": "e4u66t3", "post_id": "9abi3e", "comment": "\"I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else's\" - John McCain\n\nMay we all seek to serve our country with the same selflessness and fierce love of Senator McCain.\n\nCondolences to his family.\n\nEdit: Full quote from /u/boner_jamz_69\n\n>I fell in love with my country when I was a prisoner in someone else\u2019s.

Some accounts from fellow prisoners even went so far as to say that, if other prisoners were targeted for interrogation and torture, he would deliberately act aggressively, creating outbursts so that the attention would be drawn to him, and he would be beaten instead. His limbs and ribs were broken and re-broken constantly, and he was never able to completely recover. He endured daily rope beatings for two hours, all the while suffering from dysentery. And yet still, he made sure that the men he was with were taken care of. When his father, John McCain Jr. was named commander of all US forces in Europe, the North Vietnamese attempted to make a deal with him in order to release his son. John McCain III refused, saying that he would not leave the NVA prison unless every single soldier that was there with him was release as well. And then the beatings continued. To this day, he is incapable of raising his arms above his head due to the torture he endured.\n\n>At this point he could have left the military and still been a hell of a war hero. But he didn\u2019t do that. He endured grueling physical therapy all in the hopes of staying in the military, so he could ensure that other members were taken care of. He stayed in the military for 22 years.\n\n>He could have retired to a nice quiet life again at this point, but he didn\u2019t. He still had a desire to change the world. McCain ran for the Senate in 1982, at one point delivering the most devastating political response ever to someone who accused him of district shopping:\n\n>\u201cListen, pal. I spent 22 years in the Navy. My father was in the Navy. My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.\u201d\n\n>And he stayed in, still championing various bills which he believed would better the world. Now, history has shown us that some of these ideas obviously weren\u2019t the best in retrospect, but he still wanted to leave the world in a better state than he found it.\n\n>In 2008, he ran against Barack Obama for President. I need to note that at this time, he vehemently opposed any notion that he would run ads, or stand on a platform that mudslings. His mentality was that he would run his campaign on a foundation of voters choosing which ideals they wanted represented in office. No cheap shots or insults would be allowed in his campaign. There\u2019s a video on YouTube where he invited an elderly woman on stage who accused Barack Obama of being Arabic. His response? \u201c \u201cNo ma'am. He\u2019s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\u201d\n\n>And in 2010, while the Republican party was staunchly entrenched against the President, filibustering as much as they could against his policies, one of which was the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t ask, Don\u2019t tell,\u201d it was John McCain who said that, consequences be damned, I\u2019m not going to sit here and try to win a political trench war against everything. This guy has some good ideas, and I\u2019m not going to stop everything he says on principle, I\u2019m going to have some discourse.\n\n>I would also be remiss if I did not mention the fact that he spent his whole life believing that homosexuality is immoral. He was even against the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d But in 2013, he totally reversed his opinion of it. Think about that for a moment. at 76 years old, this man said \u201cyou know what? I was wrong my whole life about something.\u201d That takes mental fortitude that I\u2019ve never personally seen in any individual. Even now, he is a champion of LGBT rights in both the military and America as a whole.\nTo this day, John McCain is the poster child of bipartisanship in politics. He is a man who lives by the phrase \u201cWe might disagree on some things, but we can agree on some things in order to make this world a better place.\u201d\nJohn Sidney McCain III is the the person I strive to be as a soldier, an American, and a human. If I grow to be but a fraction of the person he is, I will consider my life an accomplished one indeed.\n\n>Edit: Holy wow this blew up. Thank you all for the love and gold that's come my way! I want to use this temporary platform to talk about something just as important to me as John McCain is: you. Please don't just read this and forget it. Follow the legacy that he has led his whole life. Go out and be selfless. Be kind. Call your mom. Say hi to your neighbors. Offer to carry groceries for the lady struggling to push a buggy at the grocery store. Go volunteer at the local animal or homeless shelter. I guarantee you, 5 minutes of your time can change someone's world. It's the best way you can honor someone like Senator McCain. Again, thank you all so much."}, {"comment_id": "e4u6v9y", "post_id": "9abi3e", "comment": "RIP. A true American Hero.

Almost every day someone called sick or just didnt show up to work so he ended up having to do their work too. He was in charge of the whole restaurant and if something went wrong it was his ass on the line. Which is basic manager stuff but the amount he was being paid ended up being only a few dollars more than everyone else.

I had a very rough childhood because I have a scar that disfigures part of my face, I was teased for much of my life and I was always the 'odd' kid. Highschool made it all worse and I didn't have anyone to really...fall back on. I came from a poor family, my mom was a drug addict, my dad fell back into alcoholism when my nanny (his mother) died. I didn't have very many friends. All I had were my books. I was really struggling and I had a few acquiescence I had made with some goth and punk kids. \n\n\nWell, one day, one of them I'd say I was friends with came to me and gave me this beat up discman. It was blue and silver and covered in stickers. They also gave me a burned copy of Hybrid Theory and told me \"you should really listen to this\". I did and like...I just remember having this intense, tingling feeling rush through me. For as much as people make fun of linkin park's lyrics these days, to someone in that mind state it really...speaks to them. \n\n\nAs I listened to the songs I realized everything they sung about was what I was going through and that meant there were people out there who did understand. They understood, they made it through and now here they are, singing about it. That revelation stopped me from ending my life.\n\n\nOne of their songs asks \"What am I leaving when i'm done here?\". I wish more than anything I would have been able to tell Chester and the rest of the band that atleast ONE thing, of many, they left was a young girl who found a way to fight through their depression and keep going forward.\n\nEdit: Oh wow, I didn't expect this comment to get the attention it did.

I was only to have christian friends. I was to win at everything. A loss, to them, was only possible if I did not have faith in god and was therefore a wicked child who didn't try hard enough. If god could part the red sea, surely I could become the national champion in six different things at once. I became the state chess, debate and science fair champion, made it to all state in violin, and one tier below the professional orchestra at NEC. They didn't even go to my state debate champion awards ceremony. I remember standing alone outside waiting to be picked up while the second and even fifth place winners walked out with their happy parents. I cried, and when my father took me home he beat me for crying. I got straight As, I got a perfect score on the PSAT and a 2360 on the SAT. I took every single AP class at once and even took all of Harvard's undergraduate curriculum for biology while still in high school. It didn't matter. Nothing was ever good enough for them. Success wasn't to be rewarded. It was expected. The only time my father ever told me he was proud of me was when I got into caltech, which was immediately followed by his profound disappointment that I did not get into Harvard. I was only allowed to listen to classical music and was not allowed to hang out with other kids except christian kids and only on special occasions during christian potlucks. We only wore khaki pants and polo shirts, with the pants pulled up very high so we didn't look like \"gangsters with saggy jeans\". Dating was forbidden, and any sexual confusion was just ignored and treated like a mysterious evil curse. \n\nBecause my grandfather was both a pastor and military policeman with old ROC values, my father was just as strict and frugal. We had descended from the \"Dragon\" family line of generals stretching far back into history. We were to assemble at attention in a line instantly when called within 10 seconds or be beaten. No heat on the coldest nights and no air conditioning on the hottest days. Showers should only take 1 minute. We were not allowed to have food preferences. All food had been graciously provided by god, they said. He would buy clothes too big for us meant to last ten years. No TV. No celebrations on sinful american holidays. We were to forgo earthly needs, because \"man did not live on bread alone.\" Often, dinner consisted of a $1 hot dog wrapped in a kraft cheese single with one piece of white bread and a slice of lettuce. We ate rice gruel often. To this day I have a preference for super cheap food, like eating plain rice with just soy sauce and sesame oil. Because he didn't believe in women's rights or birth control, my mother kept having children. I had 4 other siblings. This made us very poor. Sometimes all we had to eat were saltines and condiments that we took from the free section of wendy's. We lived in a barn infested with bugs and were the poorest kids in town. I remember one time I asked my mother if we could give a friend a ride two blocks down and she screamed at me and then broke down in tears, saying we were running out of gas for the month and that my dad had to get to work. When things finally did get better, my dad said he would buy us an xbox if we could beat him in chess. When we beat him, he said instead that we had to win a tournament. When we finally got the console, he made us play The Bible Game on it, banned most violent games, and play DDR to exercise but only on songs that he approved of.\n\nBecause god had let the Israelites wander for 40 years as punishment until every person older than 18 died, my parents took that to mean that children weren't considered humans yet who could really make judgements they could be held accountable for. They basically thought we had no human rights of our own. My family made Tiger Mom look like Barney.\n\nBecause I had almost died when I was two months old to pneumonia, my parents had declared me a sacrifice to god, a Nazirite, if I were to survive. \"You are a priest forever, in the name of Melchizedek\", they told me. My life was not my own, because I had already died and this new life belonged to god. They named me Long Zhan in Chinese, meaning Dragon Warrior, and Genesis in english. I was to wear the armor of god and wage holy war against Satan. Ironically it basically meant my names were Genesis and Revelation, since revelation is often known as the dragon war. Which meant they named me Alpha and Omega, or god.\n\nOne day I stumbled upon a book in my father's study, where he kept his books from college. I read Nietzche's Beyond Good And Evil, thinking it was a christian book. When I finished reading it, everything changed. The things he said made too much sense for me to ignore.\n\nTHERE IS NO GOD kept flashing in my mind. I couldn't ignore it. I tried to force myself to believe in god and become christian again but it didn't work. I tried praying, but god wasn't there.\n\nI hid my new beliefs. I knew what would happen if my parents, who often told me that a wicked child should be stoned to death, found out. They often said they would rather kill me with their bare hands than raise an atheist.\n\nIt came to a head one day in middle school when I couldn't deal with a meaningless life anymore. I snuck away during worship and hid under a staircase, repeating to myself in shock \"what's the point?\"\n\nMy friend Katherine found me there. She understood. She was also dealing with hidden depression. We sat in our misery for hours. Before that moment, it seemed everyone was in paradise. That they were the dancing figures on the walls in Plato's cave that I was once a part of. It seemed all of them faced forward and that somehow I had looked backwards and found the void of nothingness behind their paradise that nobody else saw. But when I asked her what we could do, she didn't know how to answer either. We were blind leading the blind.\n\nToday I know this feeling isn't rare and that I wasn't alone. But because I was so isolated by christian rules, I didn't know of anything else in the world. I didn't know that the somber \"why bother\" of nihilism could be interpreted as the adventurous \"why not?\" I was an echo chamber of my own dark thoughts, with no-one to guide me. The only wise people were philosophers I read after Nietzche like Kant, and they were all dead. They couldn't talk to me. It was a long time before I would ever discover Nagel and Camus or the freedom of absurdism. Everyone I knew was christian. We had spent years shunning non-christians and the world outside my bubble was classified under a ubiquitous fog of war.\n\nWhen my father found me under the stairs he yelled at me for embarrassing him in the church and beat me when I got home. Slowly, they began to suspect that I was no longer christian. I remember making armor out of cardboard and wood in secret to protect against my father's blows. I remember making a runaway kit.  I remember running for my life up into the attic to keep my mother from killing me with a kitchen knife and calling the police while holding the door shut with my feet as she clawed at it. I remember fighting my father with a chair and cooking pot when he came for me with a metal bat.\n\nA friend of mine sent me the song Numb. I know that song saved me. It finally told me that someone else out there had dealt with this and come out with this beautiful song. It told me that the veneer of constant serenity of christianity I had forgotten I had even put up was a farce, that sometimes it was okay to be upset and mad and to punch a wall and let out all of these feelings instead of letting them eat me up. That it was preferable to feel anything, even bad things, instead of nothing, because then I valued the good more. The sonorific screams cut through my numbness.\n\nI remember sneaking up at 5am at night to play Morrowind to deal with stress while listening to Meteora on my cd player in secret and all the candy bars I had to sell at school to buy new batteries. I remember how when I entered portal temples Easier To Run would somehow always play as the sun rose outside my window, like it was telling me someday I would be free. To this day that song still pops up in my mind unbidden every time the sun rises. I listened to that CD player until it stopped spinning. I remember how I danced to Faint and went wild so I wouldn't be ignored anymore, how I longed for Somewhere I Belong and my heart soared when the ghostly echo of \"heal\" sounded. I remember being inspired to draw gothic art of monsters by Papercut, and how my mother poured oil on it and threw it in the trash. Years later when my sister took art lessons, I snuck something I drew to her teacher. He told me I had more talent than my sister did, said it to my mother's face. And my sister won the congressional national competition and her art is hanging in capitol hill. He made my sister use my other art pieces as the basis for her next few pieces, that I had given to my friend Annette in a folder so that it wouldn't be found in my house.\n\nToday, I'm a scientist and a breakdancer with zero signs of depression. I pushed through despite my parents not supporting my desire to be a biologist because they didn't believe in evolution, or thinking that breakdancing was just something that homeless black gangsters did while rolling around dirty floors. I taught myself bioinformatics in the kitchen, did research by hand that others did on computers or in the lab. I learned to do dangerous moves on concrete. Linkin Park saved my life. I have never cared for celebrity news before but somehow I am genuinely sad at Chester's passing because this man who saved me had no one to save him and I feel almost guilty."}, {"comment_id": "dkhojkn", "post_id": "6oi3gu", "comment": "I met Linkin Park in early 2001, when their tour came to my town. My local radio station had a meet-&-greet at a Blockbuster Music and barely anyone had heard of them.

I remember seeing a young guy with green hair come out of an SUV and we didn't even know what Linkin Park looked like really. No one clapped, no one really noticed until they went in and sat down. They had their CD, Hybrid Theory up for sale for $4.99 and they would sign it for free. Didn't want to buy it, but the radio station gave me a license plate for them to sign.\n\nI got to talk to Chester at the event a little bit, and he seemed like a really nice guy and was SUPER excited to have even 10 people show up for him. He shook all of our hands and him and Mike Shinoda were really gracious guys - the whole band was really. They were still SUPER new and being on a nationwide tour with P.O.D. was just a lot for them to process. I'll never forget meeting them, I still remember it fondly 16 years later. I've always been a fan, I even bought their songs for Rock Band 3 and bought the keyboard that goes with so I could play the Pro Keys for it, which was somewhat like actually playing the song. \n\nRIP Chester."}, {"comment_id": "dkhj49l", "post_id": "6oi3gu", "comment": "Everyone's fighting a battle you know nothing about.

This post is kind of a mess because I was trying to find information about this show while I wrote it and I kept going back and adding information.  Sorry about that.\n\nSo, I met these guys right before the release of Hybrid Theory.  They were an opening act...\n\n...I can't think of who the headliner was though...Found it!  Looks like I was there to see Twiztid and Kottonmouth Kings - no wonder I couldn't really remember that part of the show.  I was going though a juggalo phase, think of that what you will.  Oh yeah, ReHab was there and at that time they were this corny rap group who actually had strippers that toured with them.  Same songs, but they sounded completely different.\n\nRight - they were opening that tour (I don't think anyone was there to see them, in fact) at a little club in Winston Salem, NC:  Ziggy's.  It's closed now but they used to have some amazing shows.  I saw acts from Hank Williams III to Deftones to Weezer to ICP there, it was a really kind of \"close\" space - just about anywhere you were, it felt like you could reach out and touch the people on stage.\n\n...or at least get fully doused in Faygo\n\nAnyway, their show - this would have been around mid-to-late 1999 (found it!  Looking through setlist.fm - it was September 18th, 2000) was just amazing, partly because of the venue but largely because of their performance.\n\nThere couldn't have been more than a couple of dozen people in the place for their show, but it was probably one of the tightest live performances I've *ever* seen - and I've helped run sound for acts like MDC, Jucifer, Skeleton Witch, and plenty of others - not to mention the shows I've attended as an audience member.\n\nThe guitar player wore headphones.  I've never seen anyone else do that.  The \"DJ\" didn't just do the record-scratching that it seemed all other rap-rock-metal-alternative-Bizkit-bands did around then.  He was live-sampling and mixing the levels of the other members on stage.  The synergy between them was on another level.  The live sound was pretty much album-quality, but it was right *there*...\n\nI told them as much after the show.  They were humble, gracious, and extremely nice.  I told them straight up:  You guys are going to be selling out arenas before too much longer.  I'm paraphrasing here, but Chester said something like \"that would be amazing, but I don't really think so.  We've been doing this kind of thing for a while now and we just love going around and playing for people who are into the music.\"  It seemed like they weren't thinking \"what does the radio want, how can we sell a hundred million records?\" - they were more like \"this is what we sound like when we do what we love, enjoy it with us.\n\nChester and Mike signed two demo tapes for me.  I've still got them.  Besides tshirts, posters, and other random merch that I've been given by bands who I've booked or done stage work for, I don't really have any other \"memorabilia\" - just those two tapes.  I stopped paying attention to them well over a decade ago.  I just wasn't into the sound anymore, to be honest - tastes change.  I still think the first record is brilliant, and the second record is pretty great too - those songs will always remind me of my early years in the Marines.  Someone was almost always blasting one of those CDs during field day.\n\nI mopped so many floors to those tracks.\n\nI wish he hadn't gone so soon.  He was full of music, and poetry.  Maybe it was a bit on-the-nose, a bit too much angst...too much anger, resentment, and other vague but passionate feelings towards an undefined \"you.\"  Some might say that's simplistic, formulaic - but it allows for the listener to place themselves in the narrative of the song, and recognize the things that they're feeling - and know by extension that they're not alone.  As an angsty young guy with too many hormones and too little life experience, it was very therapeutic sometimes to just turn the volume up and scream along.  I know I'm not alone in this either - I've seen you doing the same thing when I drive by you in traffic, don't try to deny it.\n\nIt's just a shame that the man who wrote those words couldn't find the same solace in them that they conveyed to so many others.\n\nI could close this out with almost any couple of lines from one of their songs, but I don't want to pick just one.  So go hit up YouTube, dig deep into your mp3 library, or even dust off an old CD and play a song or two for yourself...and enjoy the music.  That's what he told me was most important, and I think that's the kind of farewell he would have wanted."}, {"comment_id": "dkhj31r", "post_id": "6oi3gu", "comment": "What's sad is Chester was lashing out at fans a couple months ago, because fans hated their new album for being over produced pop. He was angry at being called a sell out and was confrontational. He seemed genuinely angry and was lashing out constantly. A redditor below said that in recent shows, fans would throw bottles at them when they played their new singles.\n\nThen his best friend Chris Cornell dies, and it's his birthday today. I wonder if it was all too much for him. Since he took his life the same way Chris did, and on his birthday.\n\nAs someone that did not like their new album, I feel fuckin awful. I know I wasn't an asshole about it, and I have a right to be critical. But as someone that grew up with their music (Hybrid theory and Meteora were huge in middle school) - I can't help but feel awful.\n\n**EDIT:**\n\nI apologize if I opened up a debate about criticism. This is a touchy subject given Chester just died. But to be clear, I'm only talking about myself on a personal level in my post.\n\nI didn't mean to make others feel guilty for not liking an album. It's perfectly okay to not like art and to even be critical of it. I think we all know the difference between being critical - and being an asshole. Attacking him and yelling he's a sell out on twitter - because he made music you didn't like - that is not valid criticism. That is malicious. That isn't the same as not liking an album, and being critical.\n\nI'm sorry if I pushed this conversation into another direction. I've been crying non stop, and I can't help but feel a lot of emotions. I personally feel guilt - but it's not rational. It's just a personal thing I'm feeling. I didn't mean for others to feel that.\n\nI also wanted to say that, we fans (regardless if you hated some of their work) - should be supporting each other and not taking out our emotions on each other. At the end of the day, we all loved a piece of who they are. We all loved what Chester could create.

I gotta write this.\n\nHybrid Theory on CD was mine the week it came out, and Linkin Park immediately became a foundational pillar of my musical world. I was 13 at the time. Over the years, I have never lost faith in them or hated them. The only album I haven't loved is The Hunting Party. I adore every other main album of theirs for various reasons.\n\nI fucking LOVE One More Light. The band was never, ever afraid of exploring and trying new sounds. Sell outs? Nah, they morphed their music as they grew as people, and appropriately so.\n\nQuick story: my father was arrested for some real shit when I was in high school, and my family's perfect little suburban Americana life was irrevocably upended. This was soon after Meteora came out, and in my deep depression of immediate post-father-arrest, I became severely attached to the song Breaking the Habit. I would play it on repeat for days and days on my speakers, with my bedroom's door shut and locked (the key to open it always available on the door frame, of course - house rules). My poor mother was worried sick about my intentions, obviously. Back then, I wasn't even considering harming myself, but in retrospect it's completely understandable why she thought so, especially with that song. But goddamnit it helped me cope, and that song is the single most important song in my entire life, and a complete demonstration of how music can heal.\n\nWriting this post has reduced me to tears, and they aren't manly tears, they are pure tears of sadness and pain. I'll be selfish here, realizing his band mates (family of choice) and wives and children hurt so much worse, but goddamnit I lost something so special and dear to me today.\n\nI love you, Chester, thank you.

He bravely battled depression, body dysmorphia, shame, substance abuse and suicidal thoughts for nearly 30 years; and chose to channel that trauma and anger into his art - something I could certainly relate to (and admire) in my early adolescence. It was rare for \"Hybrid Theory\" to leave my CD player when I was 14/15. I felt less alone when I listened to that album. I felt understood. I skated to it. Linkin Park - along with Blink 182, NIN, and Marilyn Manson were much more the sound/a phase of my youth than Sound Garden, or Nirvana.\n\nWhen I look at Chester's life, the life of a tormented artist - who's effort was often ridiculed by people (including myself in my mid-twenties) who don't make anything other than critiques and criticisms - similar to Van Gogh, and David Foster Wallace (who also took their own lives) I am reminded of when I attempted to hang myself, in treatment, when I was nearly 26 years old - and ripped the lighting fixture out of the ceiling. I am reminded of the letter I had written my mother that stated \"I swear to God I tried\", congruent with Van Gogh's last letter to his brother, Theo - in which he wrote \"The sadness will last forever\".\n\nI think about how absolutely (for lack of a better word) *fucked* my life felt after overdosing, getting kicked out of grad school, and finding myself over 40k in debt. Stripped of the only coping mechanism (oxycontin) I had that worked at staving off the torment of just trying to survive. But when I thought I hit bottom, it started hitting back - and I know, from experience (I've broken a lot of bones), that there is no bruise like the bruise that loneliness kicks into your spine. Shame has an uncanny ability to warp/destroy any healthy perspective of ourselves, and our ability to be loved. It's like a shattered mirror. I thought that there was something inherently wrong with me - that I was broken/damaged - and that perspective dictated my behavior.\n\nA common misconception about \"why\" people chose to take their own lives is that they are \"weak\" or \"troubled\". And that couldn't be further from the truth.\n\nTo quote David Foster Wallace on the subject:\n\n> The so-called \"psychotically depressed\" person who tries to kill his/herself doesn\u2019t do so out of quote \"hopelessness\" or any abstract conviction that life\u2019s assets and debits do not square. And surely not because death seems suddenly appealing. The person in whom Its invisible agony reaches a certain unendurable level will kill themselves the same way a trapped person will eventually jump from the window of a burning high-rise.\n\n> Make no mistake about people who leap from burning windows. Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, the fire\u2019s flames: when the flames get close enough, falling to death becomes the slightly less terrible of two terrors. It\u2019s not desiring the fall; it\u2019s terror of the flames. And yet nobody down on the sidewalk, looking up and yelling \"Don\u2019t!\" and \"Hang on!\", can understand the jump. Not really. You\u2019d have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.\n\n\nHaving felt those flames - and making that choice to jump, I know (now - almost 7 years later) that it was definitively the wrong choice to make. I wasn't aware of any other option. I didn't know that if I asked for help - I wouldn't just learn how to fight those flames - people would meet me in them. I was terrified that if I was honest about how I felt, and what I thought about daily - that I'd end up in drooling in the corner of a padded room - pumped full of so many anti-psychotics that I wouldn't even respond to my own name. But what I was really afraid of was feeling the weight of everything. Of beauty, darkness, and trauma. I couldn't imagine, much less live in a world that wasn't curbed by something.\n\nThese days I'm not plagued, I still have intrusive thoughts, but I promise, it does get better. I got better because I got (and continue to get) the professional help I need(ed). I feel the weight of everything, in it's entirety, and it is more than enough. \n\nI am no longer sick, **I am infected with the tremendous excitement of living, because I believe that I have the strength to bear it. I believe that you do as well.**\n\nSo if you struggle with depression, substance abuse, and/or suicidal thoughts I want you to know you are not alone. I know that there is hope because I carry it with me. And I'm not going to yell up from the street asking you to hold on. I'll meet you in the flames every time they rise.\n\nAnd I know there is a chance that the worst day may still be coming, so let me say for the record \"I'm still going to be here, asking the world to dance - even if it keeps stepping on my holy feet\".\n\nFriend, if all we have to gain in staying is each other - My God that is plenty. My God, that is enough.\n\nThat is so, so much for the light to give.\n\nPS: Please consider giving a donation to https://www.rainn.org in Chester's Memory."}, {"comment_id": "dkiacb5", "post_id": "6oi3gu", "comment": "As a black man, born and bred in Atlanta Ga. surrounded by \"thugs\" and \"trap stars\" who's on the verge of 30 I have a lot to thank LP and Chester for.\n\nHybrid Theory was the first album I ever bought.

Democracies live and die by the quality of accessible information and understanding of current issues: illiterate and ill-informed voters make illiterate and ill-informed decisions, often voting against public interests because they are ill-informed, allowing outside influences to slowly disintegrate the very freedoms inherent in a democracy. Ensuring fair access to accurate information is a critical part of ensuring the survival of a democracy.\n\nHowever, since the removal of several regulations in the 1980s to make it more \u201cmarket-oriented\u201d, the FCC has gradually, systematically, and dangerously veered away from its mission to ensure equal access to reliable information. It has deeply wounded American democracy in the process, and seeks to wound it mortally.\n\nThe FCC was originally bound by a number of regulations - among them, The Fairness Doctrine of 1949. The Fairness Doctrine required television broadcasters, radio stations, and cable providers to both inform the public about important issues, and to do so in an honest, equitable, and balanced way - to expose viewers to opposing viewpoints in a reasonable and truthful manner. The FCC\u2019s enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine is responsible for Americans\u2019 trust of broadcast and television news. Legally obligating broadcasting license holders to both present critical issues to Americans and to do so in a way that accurately reflected reality ensured that citizens could reasonably expect that they were getting an accurate representation of a given issue when they watched the news. Consumers had no need to seek multiple sources, since those multiple sources would essentially be hitting the same notes on the same issues. Consumers could trust that broadcast networks were accurate, reliable, honest sources of information.\n\nThe Doctrine\u2019s removal, and the FCC\u2019s subsequent lack of responsibility to uphold broadcast standards, has destroyed the quality broadcasts that built trust in those institutions.\n\nWhen the Fairness Doctrine was effectively eliminated in 1987, and officially eliminated from law in 2011, the FCC was no longer obligated to issue fines to broadcast networks who intentionally represented facts in untruthful or misleading ways. When the Doctrine was eliminated, the FCC was no longer expected to uphold the high standard of communication that had built the American public\u2019s confidence and trust in broadcast networks. \n\nThe FCC\u2019s failure to enforce communication standards since the 1980s has allowed market pressures to contaminate the quality of news broadcasts. Moreover, broadcast networks became incentivized to ensure that they had the largest audience possible, by any means necessary. As a result, broadcast news networks have become more partisan, more extreme, more reactionary, and focus on their own agendas rather than public interest. This is demonstrated by the razor-sharp partisan divides exhibited by viewership at each of the major broadcast news stations, and the fervor with which those news stations present issues in ways that support their own avaricious agendas rather than the best interests of the American people.\n\nThe FCC ceased to regulate broadcast media against market pressures, and in return, broadcast news has been corrupted by those market pressures.\n\nWithout FCC enforcement of the Fairness Doctrine, TV news networks are now allowed to present current events with whatever partisan or corporate slant they deem most self-serving. They are allowed to misrepresent fact using both misleading \u201cexperts\u201d on two sides of uncontroversial issues, and one-sided presentations of controversial issues. They are allowed to not report on momentous news regarding American democracy, and instead discuss sensationalist accounts of news for the sole purpose of securing larger crowds of viewers. They are allowed to lie to their viewers in all but letter, and all in the name of profit for the companies that own them.\n\nThe FCC stood passively by and allowed broadcast networks to be corrupted by greed.\n\nBut now, the FCC is ACTIVELY ENCOURAGING corporate interests to corrupt the internet.\n\nIn December 2017, the Chairman of the FCC will hold a vote to overturn the principle of net neutrality. Net neutrality requires that all information be treated equally by internet service providers. In other words, net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging different amounts of money based on the websites a customer visits, the same way that an electric company can\u2019t charge a different rate for the electricity to power a microwave than they charge to power a light bulb.\n\nNet neutrality prevents ISPs from charging extra fees to visit certain websites. It prevents ISPs from slowing a customer\u2019s internet connection because the customer is using the services of the ISP\u2019s competitor. Net neutrality prevents ISPs from charging content providers (such as YouTube, Netflix, The New York Times, and IGN) exorbitant fees to ensure that their content is viewable in the \u201cfast lane\u201d. It prevents ISPs from blocking websites based on the consumer\u2019s ability to pay.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge fees for any imaginable reason.\n\nSince net neutrality is the existing paradigm, it may be difficult to imagine a world where fees are ubiquitous to internet use. Under net neutrality, you pay your monthly subscription fee for internet service. You connect to the internet, and can access anything you find without the ISP charging additional fees based on what you access.\n\nWithout net neutrality, ISPs could charge an extra fee unless you used their brand of modem. They could charge more to access certain websites, or offer subscriptions to the services that they own, so that you don\u2019t have to pay additional fees whenever you wanted to access their service. They could squash their competition by forcing content providers to pay exorbitant fees to be offered to the ISP\u2019s customers, preventing the growth of non-ISP businesses into the ISP\u2019s markets. ISPs could write clauses into their service contracts that terminate your service if you visit certain websites, charging exorbitant fees to reinstate your service.\n\nWithout net neutrality, there is no oversight for what ISPs can and can\u2019t charge for. \n\nThe FCC is not only standing aside to let net neutrality be dissolved, but are actively encouraging its dissolution.\n\nIn December, the FCC will hold a vote to to take away our equal access to information, and give that power to the ISPs themselves.

Period. End of story. ISPs are notoriously shady, but here are some reassurances Trump's FCC has given us**:\n\n**FTC Privacy Regulation, sec.177 aka Facebook, Reddit, etc. can't snoop on your privacy:**\n\n>Restoring FTC [Federal Trade Commission] jurisdiction over ISPs will enable the FTC to apply its extensive privacy and data security expertise to provide the uniform online privacy protections that consumers expect and deserve.651\n\n**Direct quote from Trump's FCC:  No throttling. FCC release, p.83**\n\n>Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content.507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508\n\n**b-but im an ISP I don't wanna be transparent I just wanna bait-and-switch my customers (FCC release p.82):**\n\n>The FTC\u2019s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority \u201cprohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,\u201d which makes voluntary commitments enforceable.502 The FTC also requires the \u201cdisclos[ur]e [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,\u201d so if an ISP \u201cfailed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC\u2019s deception authority would apply.\u201d503\n\n**Specifically good for new media ISPs cannot conspire. (FCC invokes Sherman Act Antitrust Laws, Section 144, p.85, FCC release)**\n\n>Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.518\n\n**UNLIMITED NETFLIX, and other video sources (Yes this includes porn) **\n\n>If an ISP that also sells video services degrades the speed or quality of competing \u201cOver the Top\u201d video services (such as Netflix),526 that conduct could be challenged as anticompetitive foreclosure.\n\n**Here's the big one.  Free Press was pushing hard to mess up the network's ability to regulate and wanted to censor it hard.  This won't happen under Trump's FCC (THANK GOD)**\n\n>We also conclude that the Commission should have been cautioned against reclassifying broadband Internet access service as a telecommunications service in 2015 because doing so involved \u201claying claim to extravagant statutory power over the national economy ...\"\n\n**And this is the big one.  Unlike Obama's net neutrality this new system would not only allow competitors to self regulate but if they *DO* misbehave the FTC would destroy them.**\n\n>176.We also reject AT&T\u2019s assertion that the Commission should conditionally forbear from all Title II regulations as a preventive measure to address the contingency that a future Commission might seek to reinstate the Title II Order.647 Although AT&T explains that \u201cconditional forbearance would provide an extra level of insurance against the contingency that a future, politically motivated Commission might try to reinstate a \u2018common carrier\u2019 classification [2015 Net Neutrality Regulations],\u201d648 we see no need to address the complicated question of prophylactic forbearance and find such extraordinary measures [are] unnecessary.\n\nTLDR\n\n*    Regulatory rollback throwback to 90's.\n\n*    FCC claims the 2015 Regulations gave the government \"extravagant statutory power over the national economy\". \n\n*    Regulatory oversight of the ISP industry shifts back to FTC (Federal Trade Commission) as it has been since the invention of the internet.\n\n*    FCC is enforcing against throttling, censorship, restriction, etc. by invoking consumer protection and anti-trust laws (via FTC).\n\n*    If ISPs collectively conspire to paywall a content-provider, they are subject to FTC anti-trust penetration.\n\n*    FCC has reduced its own jurisdiction, because they're typically geared toward stricter and narrower regulations (censoring profanity on the radio, cable, etc.) as opposed to regulating the entire internet service-provider industry.\n\n*    FCC repeatedly acknowledges that its new policy is deliberately business-friendly in hopes to expand the economy (internet plays a huge role obviously). Acknowledges that potential abuse of this friendliness will result in stricter policy.\n\n*    America has some of the shittiest internet in the world because our infrastructure is antiquated and fiber-optic trenching projects keep getting killed. Hopefully this provides the investment needed to fix that. Better infrastructure means faster speeds and cheaper service.\n\n*    [THIS IS A BIG ONE]  Remember all the Congressmen who wanted to sell out our personal information earlier this year?

Honestly, your system is beyond fucked up.\n\nI took a short time visiting nursing position at a small private hospital in California when I was fresh out of school.  The hospital was generally private pay and elite clients, but would occasionally take medicare clients when they had large amounts of unoccupied beds.\n\nThe majority of my rotation were run of the mill routine patients, but I had one Medicare patient who was terminal cancer and was not leaving that bed.  Going to leave it as vague as possible.  But lots of pain. They were up for their pain meds when another client rang (elective cosmetic procedure, day before surgery) and asked if someone could wash their windows. I advised that as soon as I was finished with one other client I would call to have housekeeping to come up.\n\nBy the time I had come back to the desk from the Medicare clients room I had a message to head down and see the floor manager.  There were two other hospital brass members in with her, I believe one was HR and one was a board member.\n\nWhat followed was one of the most surreal experiences of my life. Apparently that patient put in a complaint about the fact I didn\u2019t wash her windows immediately, and when I advised that I had needed to see another client, with terminal cancer, for pain management first, and it had been less than ten minutes since the request about the windows, I was advised that I needed \u2018to understand that this is a private pay client, not a Medicare patient\u2019.\n\nWhen I said; \u2018just to be clear, I\u2019m supposed to wash windows rather than treat the pain of a terminal cancer patient\u2019 I was not surprised at the response.\n\n\u2018Well we would never say that, you just need to understand what the priorities are\u2019\n\nWhen I said that I wouldn\u2019t prioritize a housekeeping responsibility over a dying clients pain I was given the remainder of the day off, followed by a notification from the agency I was employed through that they had cancelled my contract with four week severance.\n\nHonestly, it was helpful to me professionally as it led me to further education and I\u2019m now a primary care provider with a few reasonably nice walk in clinics in my hometown.\n\nBut seriously, get a single payer system. Fuck everything about your insurance system. It\u2019s insane.  Canada has longer wait lists for some procedures, but no one needs to worry about becoming homeless because they broke a leg.\n\nOh, and fuck your price fixing pharmaceutical companies as well.\n\n[https://youtu.be/CeDOQpfaUc8](https://youtu.be/CeDOQpfaUc8)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Responses to Common Single-Payer Criticism:**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Not everyone pays equally, so why do they deserve the same care:**\n\nIn the current American system in most cases everyone is getting screwed.  Costs are inflated anywhere from [500% to 2500%](https://youtu.be/CeDOQpfaUc8). I pay the highest level of provincial health tax based on my income, around [$900 a year](https://www.ontario.ca/page/health-premium).  On top of that, I pay around $2200 a year for private insurance for private hospital rooms or out of country medical insurance.  The average cost for an x-ray in our system is around $150 in the top end.  In the US, it could be $2000 to $15,000.  Nevermind the ethical concerns, which I'm not going to cover.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**It's socialism:**\n\nThere are some institutions that are beneficial for the public good; such as roads, police or firefighters; that are not in and of themselves profitable.  As such, it benefits the entire public to have certain resources in place.  Most countries include some level of essential healthcare in this envelope.\n\nAs for personal motivation; as a medical provider in Canada I'm a private professional medical corporation that sets my own hours and decide my own patient load.  I just bill a single source rather than a hundred different companies that all have their own pricing structures.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**You're a Liberal:**\n\nAs for personal political leanings, I'm a card-carrying member of the Conservative Party of Canada.

She only had great things to say about him, and reminisced sadly at the end how his health and mental state was declining.\n\nAccording to her they had a reunion a year or two ago, and its tradition for all the Bunnies to wait downstairs and greet Hef when he would appear at the top of the spiral staircase with his big red robe and pipe. This last year, they were all waiting at the bottom and Hef appeared, looking confused and said \"Who the hell are you lot!?\" and they replied \"We're your Bunnies Hef!\" He looked confused a bit longer and shrugged and said \"Wow I must have done pretty well in life\"\n\n**edit**\nLike I said it this was according  to her, like hearing any story from a stranger on a flight, or anyone from the internet, you gotta take things with a grain of salt. Just thought it was interesting to share, I'll never know if it was true or not, but I know she did really enjoy her time at the mansion and being a bunny, that's for sure.

My grandfather subscribed to playboy for decades.  When he was in his late 80's they upped the price quite a bit and he cancelled it.  Some poor woman called him to ask why he had cancelled, pointing out to him that the price may have gone up, but now he'd get a few videos included.  He told her that he was 80 something years old, had been getting the magazine for 40 years and at his age, he really did just read it for the articles and he didn't give a damn about any dirty videos.  She must have looked at his account and realized how old he was because she dropped the price back down to what he'd been paying.\n\nThen when i was in college, i'd come home to visit and before I left he'd call me over, slip me twenty bucks and some of those magazines in a bag telling me to bring them to my guy friends at school.  That may seem a little weird - giving porn to your granddaughter to give to her guy friends - but if you knew him you'd realize it was a good deed on his part - figuring my friends couldn't afford to buy their own.  Then again maybe he figured if they were busy with those they'd leave his granddaughter alone. LOL\n\n\nIn the last month of his life he was in a nursing home and showing signs of dementia.  I was going to visit him and wanted to bring him something but couldn't figure out what.  My uncle went into his attic and pulled out some old playboys from the 70's and gave them to me to bring to grandpa.  Some may think this is weird but i remember the smile on his face when he pulled them out of the bag.  He didn't know where he was or why he was there but those magazines he knew.  Was the last time I saw him alive and I'm glad that brought a smile to his face.  \n\nEDIT - since you are enjoying my memory of Grandpa - I should show you what a badass he was.  Here he is delivering milk in a flood in Lowell MA [My Grandpa - Gordon Cutler is the one standing](https://i.imgur.com/Da0nFVo.jpg)\n\nEDIT 2:  I appreciate and am overwhelmed by all the gildings. I'm so glad my grandfather has managed to touch so many people even this many years after his passing. If anyone else is thinking of gilding - thank you - but please don't.  Grandpa loved animals and helping those down on their luck so I'd much rather you spent your four dollars donating to a shelter for either people or animals down on their luck.

Turns out, that lady was Bettie Page. Once a week, Hefner would have his driver pick her up so they could hang out at his mansion and watch movies and shit. One day, she invited my friend and I to go with her. Hefner seemed nice. The mansion was pretty empty, though. It wasn't like naked women were randomly walking around or anything. After about 45 minutes, he asked his driver to take me and my friend back to his apartment. My friend was a bit disappointed we couldn't stay longer.

At the time, I was a virulent feminist and the Playboy building was in Chicago where I lived. I saw Hef standing at his residence in Chicago at that time . He was a short guy, holding a martini in front of his Gold Coast home. I was always appalled back then , and if you were a woman back then you threw your anger at guys like Hefner and other men who you thought were misogynistic fellows. Well, I mellowed with time, and I think of all of the great articles and brilliant essays that Playboy printed, and my feelings towards Hef and his magazine became more comical and I left that stage of anger to recognize the magazine as a terrific mouthpiece for the civil rights movement at the time, and the forum for writers and artists to show their ideas. I.E., I stopped disliking Hefner and saw him as just a person who had grown up, as I had, in the repressed 1950s, when it was taboo to be so many things. His porn is mild and silly to me now, and I recognize, despite his weirdness for dressing women as rabbits, his contributions to the world of literary brilliance. He published things no one would publish at the time. Believe me, you had to live in the 50s to see how daring his magazine was...including the porn, which now merely looks to me like any catalogue for Victoria's Secret.  So, well, good journey to you , Hef. Thanks for the articles. Yep , I bought your magazine for the articles...for real...signed, Grandmother now and former angry little feminist.

Some common questions:\n\n**How many are out of the cave/left in the cave?**\n\n15:44pm BST: All four remaining rescue personnel (three Thai Navy SEALs and a doctor) that stayed with the boys in the cave are now confirmed to be out too!\n\n12:55pm BST: CONFIRMED [all twelve boys and their coach](https://cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/180627111327-thai-soccer-teens-exlarge-169.jpg) are out of the cave. \n\n**How did they end up in the cave in the first place?**\n \nThe cave is a popular spot for exploring. It's normally safe to do so, apart from in monsoon season. Though the season wasn't due for weeks, there was flash flooding, leaving them trapped in the cave. They went further into the cave to reach higher ground and to be safe from the rising water level.\n\nThe football team (though not these exact boys) had been to the caves before, they had reportedly brought snacks and went exploring on this occasion to celebrate one of the boys' birthday.\n\n**When did the team go missing?**\n\nThe boys and their coach got stuck in the cave on the 23rd June. It is thought they entered the cave in the afternoon. They were reported missing by family the same day, and rescue workers were searching for them by the evening. News outlets state that their bikes were found outside, and there fresh handprints on the cave walls, which led the rescue team to believe the boys were still alive and inside the cave. They were located by rescue divers on the 2nd July. Removing them from the cave started on 8th July.\n\n**How did they survive for 9 days before being found?**\n\nThey retreated further into the cave to reach higher ground. They had brought snacks with them to celebrate one of the boys' birthday. The coach, who was a former Buddhist monk (very common for young men in Thailand), went without food so the boys had more, and taught them meditation to help them keep calm and conserve their energy. He also taught the boys to drink water coming through the ceiling of the cave, and not from pools on the ground. \n\n**How did they decide what order to rescue them in?**\n\nThe Navy SEAL medic who went into the cave evaluated their physical and mental fitness. There has been conflicting information; news sources first said they were being brought out weakest to strongest, and then the press conference on Sunday (after the first four were rescued) suggested strongest first, or those 'most ready', according to different outlets. They are shielding the identity of everyone that's come out of the cave, so it's likely we won't know until after the rescue mission has concluded.\n\n*\"Aussie doctor Richard has been in the cave with the boys three days in a row. He gives medical sign off before each boy swims and dives out, only leaves the cave AFTER the day\u2019s operation has been completed. Just, wow.\"*\n\n**How far inside the cave were they?**\n\nAround 2.5m/4km. [See this graphic](http://static3.uk.businessinsider.com/image/5b3ee1f27708e916461bda18-2400/how-far-thai-boys-soccer-team-cave.png). It initially took rescue divers an 11-hour 'round trip' to get to the location the boys were. At one stage, the passage is so narrow divers have to remove their oxygen tank and push it through the gap ahead of themselves.\n\n**How are they being rescued? Is Elon Musk's submarine being used?**\n\nElon Musk's submarine is not being used. The Rescue Chief has said: \"Although his technology is good and sophisticated it's not practical for this mission\". A spokesperson has [thanked EM for his offer to help](https://twitter.com/JeromeTaylor/status/1016615971258159107), however.\n\nAround 90 expert divers, from both Thailand and overseas, have been working in the cave system. The process 'includes a mixture of walking, wading, climbing and diving along guide ropes already in place. Wearing full-face masks, which are easier for novice divers than traditional respirators, each boy is being accompanied by two divers, who also carry his air supply'. [This picture illustrates the process](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/624/cpsprodpb/18063/production/_102430489__102389398_thai_cave_rescue_640-nc.png).\n\nExperts had suggested previously that the boys may have been lightly sedated for the journey. The Thai PM appears to have confirmed it today. From Michael Safi (Guardian correspondent): *'Thai PM was clear today the children were not given anaesthetic: \"Who the hell would give that to a kid?\" He says they were given \"something to make them not too nervous and panic\"'*.\n\n**Have there been any causalities?**\n\n[Petty Officer Saman Gunan](https://thenypost.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/180706-saman-gunan-feature-image.jpg) (also sometimes reported as Kunan), a retired Thai Navy SEAL who volunteered for the rescue operation, lost consciousness and died on his way out of the cave, after delivering oxygen tanks. [This](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dhip9QWUYAAoeVE.jpg) is the last image taken of him.\n\n**Where are the boys and their coach now?**\n\nAll of them are under observation at a hospital in Chiang Rai. They will be kept for at least seven days to check they are healthy and haven't caught any infections in the cave. Due to disease control protocol, families have only been allowed to see them through a window, and have to be at least 2m away from them for the first 48 hours. They are currently being given easily digestible food, like porridge, to eat.\n\nInitially two of the first boys that were rescued showed signs of pneumonia and had low temperatures. They are now reported to be doing well and don't have a fever. The first eight boys out are reported to be 'cheerful'.\n\n*Let me know if you think any more questions/detailed responses should be added*"}, {"comment_id": "e24fsdd", "post_id": "8xo9qj", "comment": "Universal Studios is there and helping the survivors sign their movie  rights away."}, {"comment_id": "e24fv1u", "post_id": "8xo9qj", "comment": "This is honestly amazing and the rescue efforts of the Thai people should never be forgotten.

I mean... COME ON!! Life just gave us the opportunity of witnessing an amazing... AMAZING story and we all need to stop and savor the taste of victory. For once, we got an end that actually gives us all a chance to feel proud for being a part of the human race. There are still millions of children suffering in the world but we really need to give what just happened the value it has cause if it happened once we can make it happen again!!

For those interested, I am an American lawyer and I can answer that question with some insight.\n\nYes, the Supreme Court does have the authority to make sweeping decisions that invalidate any and all state laws which conflict with its ruling. The Supreme Court finds this authority in the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and from the very significant court case of *Marybury vs. Madison* which more or less established the Supreme Court's absolute authority to literally \"say what the law is.\"\n\nStates do have autonomy to decide certain issues for themselves. These are judicial notions of 'comity' and 'parity,' the idea that state governments are better equipped to deal with local and regional issues rather than a distant Congress in Washington. In fact, the laws of contracts traditionally belong to states, which is why every state in the U.S. has slight legal differences in how contracts are formed, enforced, written, etc. Marriage, in its most basic legal form, is a contract entered into by two consenting adults, which is why marriage laws have been decided by state legislatures and state courts.\n\nBut there's an important amendment to the U.S. Constitution that (as of today) strips away the right of a state to define marriage in their laws as a union between one man and one woman: the Fourteenth Amendment (and more specifically the Equal Protection Clause) which states:\n\n> No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\n \nWithout getting too much into the nuances of the Supreme Court's varying standards of review (although I certainly can if you're interested), the Supreme Court traditionally reviews Equal Protection issues under what's called a 'rational basis review.' It is the most permissive standard the Court can adopt--that is, it is the least difficult standard to meet in order to successfully defend a law from being struck down. The review asks whether a law is rationally related to a legitimate government interest. With respect to the issue of marriage equality, the question is: Are state laws banning same-sex marriage rationally related to the legitimate government interest of protecting the institution of marriage?\n\nTo that question the Supreme Court has apparently said 'no.' The fact that the Supreme Court today could not find any rational basis for these state bans related to the stated goal of protecting the institution of marriage says *a lot*. The Court is literally saying there is no rational relationship between banning same-sex marriage and protecting marriage. Thus, same-sex marriage bans are unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment, and every such law in the United States is immediately invalidated.\n\nThe Supreme Court has made sweeping judgments like this before, although decisions of this magnitude are quite rare. For examples, see *Brown vs. Board of Education* (which held that state laws enacting racial segregation were unconstitutional) and *Loving vs. Virginia* (which held that state laws banning interracial marriage were unconstitutional).\n\nTL;DR: Yes, the Supreme Court has the authority to say what the law is for the entire nation. Yes, marriage is traditionally an area kept to state law, but only up to a limit until a law runs headlong into the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.\n\n**Important Edit:** It appears I've disseminated some amount of disinformation for which I apologize (I did not get around to actually reading the full opinion until now). As pointed out to me by /u/Armonster20, the Supreme Court **DID NOT** review this case under rational basis. Rather, it was decided under a strict scrutiny review. The majority opinion does not even make much mention at all of the words \"sexual orientation,\" instead focusing on the fundamental right of marriage. A lot of you have asked about the varying standards of review, but I must confess that constitutional law is outside my usual day-to-day practice and I'm doing the best I can to remember the basics I learned in law school. I could try to explain the standards of review in detail but I'm afraid of saying something inaccurate. The least I can do is direct you **[here](http://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2014/01/challenging-laws-3-levels-of-scrutiny-explained.html)**.\n\nBut to go into just a little more detail, the strict scrutiny test is the most demanding standard of review to which the Supreme Court can subject a law. The reason the Supreme Court chose to review this case under this very exacting test is quite logical actually: the Supreme Court has previously said that any law that abridges a \"fundamental right\" must meet the most demanding scrutiny, and the Supreme Court has previously deemed the right to marry as a fundamental right. Thus, because any state law that excludes an entire class of people from participating in marriage obviously implicates the fundamental right to marry, we get strict scrutiny. (FYI - Another fundamental right under the Constitution is the right to have an abortion.)\n\nWhat this means is that the majority made it damn-near impossible for the respondents (i.e., the states defending their same-sex marriage bans) to win in this case. What this does NOT mean is that any future LGBT issues will be given the same standard review, unless they of course deal with marriage. Most likely, any future litigation on LGBT issues will be subject to rational basis review or something that's informally been called \"rational basis review with a bite\"--a standard somewhere between normal rational basis and intermediate scrutiny."}, {"comment_id": "csjech3", "post_id": "3b6zln", "comment": "That's it, my wife and I are getting a divorce."}, {"comment_id": "csjeb6w", "post_id": "3b6zln", "comment": "Opinion [here](http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf) (pdf)."}, {"comment_id": "csjfwlg", "post_id": "3b6zln", "comment": "This is destroying the sanctity of Bristol Palin's marriage.\n\nEDIT: more gold pls"}, {"comment_id": "csjerzg", "post_id": "3b6zln", "comment": "RIP pastor in texas who said he would light himself on fire when this day came.."}, {"comment_id": "csjenw8", "post_id": "3b6zln", "comment": "Finally, 50 states of gay!"}, {"comment_id": "csjed0m", "post_id": "3b6zln", "comment": "The final two paragraphs of the Court's opinion:\n\n> No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies\nthe highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice,\nand family.

When new insight reveals discord between the Constitution\u2019s central protections and a received legal stricture, a claim to liberty must be addressed\n\n> * Many who deem same-sex marriage to be wrong reach that conclusion based on decent and honorable religious or philosophical premises, and neither they nor their beliefs are disparaged here. But when that sincere, personal opposition becomes enacted law and public policy, the necessary consequence is to put the imprimatur of the State itself on an exclusion that soon demeans or stigmatizes those whose own liberty is then denied. \n\n> * No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family.

But those whose views do not prevail at least know that they have had their say, and accordingly are\u2014in the tradition of our political culture\u2014reconciled to the result of a fair and honest debate. ... But today the Court puts a stop to all that. By deciding this question under the Constitution, the Court removes it from the realm of democratic decision. There will be consequences to shutting down the political process on an issue of such profound public significance. Closing debate tends to close minds.

What I just wrote was the truth, and for whatever reason, this was incredibly important info for the public to know. The president was going to have a press release to reveal this info.\n\nImagine Press Group A. PG A wants to report the facts, and also spin this info in Suzie's favor.

PG B wants to report the facts only. They would report \"Suzie eats apple\". \n\nPG B did not spin this info either way, supports neither side. \n\nImagine Press Group C. PG C wants to report the facts, and also spin this against Suzie. They would report \"Suzie eats apple, spends 100k on private estate.\" (This is a true statement) \n\nPG C has intentionally worded their news to make Suzie look worse, and bolster the Anti-Suzie side of the argument.\n\nImagine Press Group D. PG D wants to *dystroy* Suzie. They're looking for a fight, not a conversation. They don't really care about \"facts\"- if they can get people to believe it, they'll print it. They would report \"Suzie throws apple at homeless man, spends 100k on kicking puppies\" (This is an outright lie- the only truth in their statement is that Suzie at one point was holding an apple. )\n\nPG D has intentionally written sensationalist nonsense in order to dupe and rile up people against Suzie.  They did not show the parts of the truth that suited them- rather, they invented a new truth that suited them.

This is a deliberate manipulation of the 'truths' released to the public, and is a disservice to every American citizen, reguardless if they agree with the topic or disagree with the topic at hand. The President should not get to decide what version of the truth the people get to see. They should not get to censor the argument by only allowing the people they agree with to report on it, end of story. \n\nThis is a disgrace.\n\nEdit: added to the top"}, {"comment_id": "de698rp", "post_id": "5vznv8", "comment": "Had to create a safe space so the delicate snowflakes running this administration didn't have to answer difficult questions.

Britt found 14 defining characteristics common to each:.....and now trump lol\n\n 1. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere, as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays.\n\n 2. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights - Because of fear of enemies and the need for security, the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of \"need.\" The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture, summary executions, assassinations, long incarcerations of prisoners, etc.\n\n 3. Identification of Enemies/Scapegoats as a Unifying Cause - The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe: racial , ethnic or religious minorities; liberals; communists; socialists, terrorists, etc.\n\n 4. Supremacy of the Military - Even when there are widespread domestic problems, the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding, and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized.\n\n 5. Rampant Sexism - The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively male-dominated. Under fascist regimes, traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce, abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution.\n\n 6. Controlled Mass Media - Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government, but in other cases, the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation, or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship, especially in war time, is very common.\n\n 7. Obsession with National Security - Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses.\n\n 8. Religion and Government are Intertwined - Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders, even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the government's policies or actions.\n\n 9. Corporate Power is Protected - The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power, creating a mutually beneficial business/government relationship and power elite.\n\n 10. Labor Power is Suppressed - Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government, labor unions are either eliminated entirely, or are severely suppressed.\n\n 11. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts - Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education, and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked.\n\n 12. Obsession with Crime and Punishment - Under fascist regimes, the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations.\n\n 13. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption - Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders.\n\n 14. Fraudulent Elections - Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates, use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries, and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control election \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "de692fl", "post_id": "5vznv8", "comment": "So when exactly do we, as citizens, draw the line?

Because of it's classification, it hasn't been studied or examined in any long term sense, which is absolutely needs to be.\n\nEpilepsy is a diverse and complicated medical disorder, and the ways we treat it are still being fine tuned. Does cannabis cure it? No, but can it treat it? We are not sure, because it's not being studied in labs the way it should. Lots of neurologists I've talked to still treat it mostly by trying different meds and hoping for the best. \n\nTLDR: Epilepsy is complicated. Use of cannabis oil hasn't been shown to help it, except in anecdotal cases, like this one. Should it be studied? Absolutely. Is it a miracle cure all? No. Can it improve some people's quality of life? Yep. So let's find out. \n\nedit: grammer."}, {"comment_id": "dmpbev4", "post_id": "6yp82o", "comment": "Weed improves test scores, cures cancer, and will make your penis *bigger.* There is literally no reason to not LEGALIZE IT."}, {"comment_id": "dmpcyc0", "post_id": "6yp82o", "comment": "Can we cut the foreplay and just decriminalize?

As a parent a child wth severe epilepsy, I can tell you cannabis oil is not a global solution for all people that have seizures. Epilepsy is a very complex disease, and medications that work for one person will not for another, even with identical seizure presentations. Additionally, it is very rare for one seizure treatment to be a magic bullet solution. Many people with epilepsy have to adjust, tweak, and change medication and treatment as they age and grow. \n\nWith that being said, I'm so happy that this boy was able to find a treatment that has worked so well for him.

People need to be very careful with CBD oil as many children suffer huge side effects ON TOP of their existing epilepsy when parents start CBD oil. I encourage everyone to take this with a massive grain of salt and please let the doctors in the field make the appropriate decision when to start CBD oil. There are many wonderful medications on the market right now that can keep children seizure free for a lifetime. CBD oil only is factored into the equation when many medications fail. There is no known mechanism of action and just like any medication this NEEDS TO BE STUDIED MORE INTENSIVELY. As a disclaimer I am in this field and am for the use of CBD oil in appropriate cases.

I tried getting *multiple counsellors* from high school over the years to find help for me, (one in particular to call cps, but, I was almost 18 (when I was 16-17) and she essentially said it would prove futile even if she called) but all of them really didn't seem to care. One of them felt like my suicidality was less important than kids trying to get scholarships, because she told me she'd check up on me again after the first time we met, but she never did. I saw kids with money take up more of her time in her office than I ever did. But, honestly in the ends, I didn't need any of their help.

I watched several of the videos on the archive and many YouTube videos where others analyze or talk about what's going on.\n\nAs a loving father, I have to say that this has really affected me today. I have two young boys, my oldest is five and is special needs. I love both of my boys more than anything in the world. I just can't imagine ever treating one of my sons the way this man treats his boy, Cody. \n\nWhile watching these videos, I see glimpses of my own son in Cody. He's sweet, intelligent, and emotionally advanced for his age, like my son is. Maybe he does have behavioral issues, but that is nowhere near a worthy excuse to put any child through the kind of abuse this poor, sweet boy has been through. Plus, Cody is a special-needs child! His poor brain is already having a hard enough time processing the world, and now this father is making things way worse by inflicting this abuse onto the poor kid. Cody knows he is being treated unfairly, but he doesn't know what to do about it, and in fact there's not much he can do. And that's what makes this so hard for me. I'm tearing up now just writing this. All those times he is left to himself crying and shouting that his family doesn't love him or like him. I just want to hug him and let him know he is loved, and I'm sorry he's been treated this way.\n\nI also feel for little Emma. I hope her and Cody will get the help and love they need now that they are back with their biological mom. Maybe that's not a perfect situation either, but nothing ever is perfect. And hopefully if there's any silver lining to this situation being so public, it's that the mom may now get the resources she needs to help the kids cope with the abuse and give them a good upbringing.\n\nI feel for the other kids too. They are just kids, even the teenager. Kids can be cruel, but it's up to responsible, loving parents to be the moderator and the filter that processes things when others are mean to them, not to contribute to the meanness or create it to begin with.\n\nThese people, Mike and Heather, are truly despicable. The emotional abuse they have caused those poor kids is heartbreaking, especially Cody. I will hug my boys extra tight tonight."}, {"comment_id": "dh1a4cz", "post_id": "68syyv", "comment": "Geez, my heart goes out to Cody. He is the only level headed and emotionally more advanced person in that home. He is very sensitive and can't be numbed or become as easily oppressed. He knows when he is being abused and he can't numb the pain and he can't accept that it is the same people who are supposed to be his big protective loving humans. The parents act like middle school bullies and manipulative idiots. They definitely should be prohibited of having custody of any child ever in their life. In fact the father deserves to go to jail for the way he just bumped Cody into the fucking bookshelf and made him bleed out of his nose(who knows if the injury was even worse than it seemed). And they want to say it was just acting/just a prank? Oh shut the hell up that is just about the weakest most elementary justification ever. All of those things screamed child abuse and obviously someone who abuses a child and thinks/pretends it is normal is someone who is all around 100% unfit to be a parent, ever. Call me extremely judgmental/harsh I don't give a damn, I draw the line when it comes to children being abused. The saddest part is that those kids don't even realize it to it's full extent how bad and stressful their daily living situation actually is. They are children with developing minds and bodies growing and changing constantly. As the stronger and more experienced adults we should protect and help them flourish not break them. Seeing it from a third person point of view just makes it crystal clear and being able to process it exactly for what it is(no ifs and buts about it) just makes it feel worse.

Anybody who knows me knows #CarrieFisher was my first love. I thrilled to the adventures of #princessleia in the @starwars movies, but from '77 to '84, I was in love with Carrie Fisher herself. My bedroom was filled with Carrie Fisher pictures from any movie she was ever in (including Polaroids I took off the TV when #thebluesbrothers hit cable). I was jealous of Paul Simon when he was dating Carrie Fisher and wouldn't listen to his music until they split up. I paid to see Carrie Fisher and #chevychase in Under the Rainbow nine times when it was in theaters (mostly because Carrie Fisher was in underwear in one scene). In childhood, I committed myself to Carrie Fisher without ever meeting her the way novice Nuns commit themselves to Christ without meeting Him. Decades later, I got to tell her this when Carrie Fisher and @jaymewes were in a station wagon on the set of #jayandsilentbobstrikeback. She was gracious about hearing it for the zillionth time from the zillionth man or woman who grew up idolizing her, but wickedly added \"I'm glad to know I helped you find your light saber.\" And with that, she stopped being Carrie Fisher to me and just became Carrie. That's the Carrie I'll always remember: the dutiful standard-bearer of childhood dreams with a the wicked sense of humor and a way with words. She didn't want to get paid for her role in @jayandsilentbob Strike Back; instead, she asked that we buy her these antique beaver chairs. Her reason: \"Beaver seems an appropriate currency for this movie.\" When she was a guest on Season 1 of our @hulu show #Spoilers, Carrie curled up in the throne like she belonged there. And she did: after all, she was royalty. As a boy, I dreamed of marrying Carrie Fisher. As a young filmmaker, I dreamed of casting Carrie Fisher. As an adult, I dreamed of being as sharp-witted and prepossessed as Carrie Fisher.

Trump (\"Trump Campaign\") and disparaging Hillary Clinton. Defendants made various expenditures to carry out those activities, including buying political advertisements on social media in the names of U.S. persons and entities. Defendants also staged political rallies inside the United States, and while posing as U.S. grassroots entities and U.S. persons, and without revealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation, solicited and compensated real U.S. persons to promote or disparage candidates. Some Defendants, posing as U.S. persons and without revealing their Russian association, communicated with unwitting individuals associated with the Trump Campaign and with other political activists to seek to coordinate political activities.\n\n* In order to carry out their activities to interfere in U.S. political and electoral processes without detection of their Russian affiliation, Defendants conspired to obstruct the lawful functions of the United States government through fraud and deceit, including by making expenditures in connection with the 2016 U.S. presidential election without proper regulatory disclosure; failing to register as foreign agents carrying out political activities within the United States; and obtaining visas through false and fraudulent statements.\n\n* Defendants and their co-conspirators used their fictitious online personas to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election. They engaged in operations primarily intended to communicate derogatory information about Hillary Clinton, to denigrate other candidates such as Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio, and to support Bernie Sanders and then-candidate Donald Trump.\n\n* On or about February 10, 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators internally circulated an outline of themes for future content to be posted to ORGANIZATION-controlled social media accounts. Specialists were instructed to post content that focused on \"politics in the USA\" and to \"use any opportunity to criticize Hillary and the rest (except Sanders and Trump- we support them).\"\n\n* From at least April 2016 through November 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators, while concealing their Russian identities and ORGANIZATION affiliation through false personas, began to produce, purchase, and post advertisements on U.S. social media and other online sites expressly advocating for the election of then-candidate Trump or expressly opposing Clinton. Defendants and their co-conspirators did not report their expenditures to the Federal Election Commission, or register as foreign agents with the U.S. Department of Justice. The political advertisements included the following:\n\n>April 6, 2016 \"You know, a great number of black people support us saying that #HillaryClintonlsNotMyPresident\"\n\n>April 7, 2016 \"I say no to Hillary Clinton / I say no to manipulation\"\n\n>April 19, 2016 \"JOIN our #HillaryClintonForPrison2016\"\n\n>May 10, 2016 \"Donald wants to defeat terrorism ...

Defendants and their coconspirators also paid for other political advertisements using PayPal accounts.\n\n* Beginning in at least 2016, Defendants and their co-conspirators used, without lawful authority, the social security numbers, home addresses, and birth dates ofreal U.S. persons without their knowledge or consent. Using these means of stolen identification, Defendants and their coconspirators opened accounts at a federally insured U.S. financial institution (\"Bank l \")\n\n* Defendants and their co-conspirators purchased credit card and bank account numbers from online sellers for the unlawful purpose of evading security measures at PayPal, which used account numbers to verify a user's identity. Many of the bank account numbers purchased by Defendants and their co-conspirators were created using the stolen identities of real U.S. persons. After purchasing the accounts, Defendants and their co-conspirators submitted these bank account numbers to PayPal.\n\nI assume the spin from the right will involve pointing out that the Russians ran ads supporting Bernie to foster the dislike for Hillary on the left (according to these indictments) and start their standard obfuscation where they conflate random things and conjure up false equivalencies.\n\nRan ads against Trump's challengers in the primaries and against his almost-guaranteed challenger in the general election? Tried to make liberals stay home on election day by using the bad blood from the primaries? Don't you mean *theytriedtosupportliberalstoobothsidesarethesamethisisabignothingburger*?\n\nThat, or they'll look at the part where it briefly mentioned that these specific Russians (who seem like they're just the lower-level ones running some of the Russian ads in America) were in contact with the Trump campaign without disclosing their actual Russian identities and say \"maybe the Russian interference happened, but no collusion!\" ignoring the guilty pleas from multiple Trump advisors for lying to the FBI, the repeated undisclosed contacts with Russian officials they tried to cover up, the Trump Tower meeting, the secret backchannel Kushner tried to set up, the fact that Trump himself won't even acknowledge the Russian interference and has refused to implement the overwhelmingly popular bipartisan sanctions, the constant dodging from Trump as Mueller tries to interview him under oath, and 50 other things I don't have the time to type out.\n\nEDIT: Also from today, another guilty plea from someone:\n\n[Mueller Announces Guilty Plea of California Man in Investigation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-02-16/mueller-announces-guilty-plea-of-california-man-in-investigation)\n\nEDIT 2: You can already see the spin coming from these comments from Rosenstein:\n\n>There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity. There is no allegation that the charge conduct altered the outcome of the election.\n\n*In this indictment* is the key phrase. Mueller's very expansive investigation at this point covers Russian interference, possible collusion from the Trump campaign, and obstruction of justice. The indictments today are pretty much just focused on the first of the three. You can't pick and choose which aspects from Mueller's investigation you want to believe, because he's already indicted multiple Trump campaign officials, received multiple guilty pleas from Trump campaign officials for lying to the FBI, and flipped multiple people. That's not \"they definitely 100% colluded!\", but it *is* way closer to that than the \"they concluded no collusion, shut down the investigation!\" angle.\n\nAs to the second part, we have already heard from multiple IC officials that none of them are commenting on whether or not this interference had an effect on the outcome of the 2016 election. \"There is no allegation of it affecting the outcome\" != \"it did not affect the outcome\". Their role as investigators is to provide factual information on who did what, not speculate on alternate timelines. Since it's near-impossible to accurate predict those outcomes, any conclusion would just be accused of partisan bias and met with cries of \"how could they possibly know what would have happened?\" regardless of which way the conclusion fell."}, {"comment_id": "ducw5lo", "post_id": "7y0phb", "comment": "Lord, give me the strength to read some of the comments.

About ten years ago, we had some deep, dark conversations about his philosophies about aging and suicide, and he was rational, calm and serious about it. \"I don't want to live past 50... I don't want to be old and be a burden on those around me, like my parents have been on me...  I'd be surprised if I make it to 50\" was what he said, generally.\n\nGuess who committed suicide last year at 47?

Thank you for the internet hugs, those who offered them.\n\nOf course, there are details that would probably be identifying, but you can also figure into the mix that there was some family issues going on, bordering JustNo-subreddits territory. But the end point is that he was coldly rational about it, calm, reasonable, and could even be humorous about it. I never said I liked it or agreed with it - I just said I knew how he felt about it, and was unsurprised once my shock wore off that he actually did it.\n\nNo, he was *not* responsible for paying for his parents' debts and poor money management. But the house they lived in was his, the car his parent(s) drove was his, etc., because they wound up not having money in retirement to pay for housing and transportation or be independent in health care. His life wound up being tethered to their needs, and he didn't see any way out of it until one or both passed. It killed his social life, hemmed his freedom, shrunk his friend circle, curtailed his career, and so forth, with no end in sight. He said that the only way he wouldn't do it is if he had certain career and relationship things going on, but if it continued the way it was going, well....\n\nNo, he was not depressed or psychotic. It was a calm discussion and assessment of the physical and mental hell his parents were going through in their sixties, and the bottom line was that he never wanted to live like that.

I was fortunate enough to be able to work remotely for almost our entire 10 week stay.  Relative to other NICU families our daughter had few problems besides being small and needing to grow, so aside from the life flight and birth and NICU costs there were no other procedures or things that cost anything above and beyond, and we were not separated for the duration of that time as most families are.  To this day it's the most difficult circumstance I've ever faced but we're all happy and healthy today.\n\nNow here's the fun part.  We jokingly refer to our daughter as \"The 3 Million Dollar Baby\", because before insurance, that was the total cost billed between my wife and her for everything altogether.  Yes, you read that right - 3 million, as in *$3,000,000.00*!  For one baby's birth.  Of course insurance negotiated prices and such and our total out of pocket ended up being around $10,000.  Still pretty fucking expensive but not 3 million dollars expensive.\n\nI'm telling this account of my experience for anyone reading who thinks our current US healthcare system is the best, or the most affordable, or that there's nothing we could do to make it better.  There is.  It's socialized medicine, and it's better in almost every way to the system we have now.

However, I do love strategy, so here's my take on the impeachment proceedings:\n\nI think the top politicians in the country have more guile than you or I. I think the Democratic leadership wants to time the impeachment proceedings to have maximum impact during the 2020 campaign trail. They know they can't get a conviction in the Senate because it's Republican-controlled. I'm not even claiming obstructionist or biased Congress, that's just the reality. But, what they can do is make political hay out of an impeachment proceeding.\n\nI think if everyone was 100% fair, impeachment should have started 2 years ago with the repeated breaches of the Emolument Clause, but didn't for the reasons above. Another thing that happened in the last two years is that Democrats were given the chance to observe the Republicans to see if they rally behind Trump or eat their own and promote Pence.\n\nImagine if there was a nasty impeachment in 2017, and then the Republicans turn on Trump and oust him, leaving Pence in charge. Then, all that wraps up by 2019, clearing the road for Pence to lead and the Republicans to campaign that behind the slogan that they're the responsible ones and moral leaders for doing what's right, even when it means turning on their own party to do what's right for the country. The campaign slogans write themselves! They get all their policies and none of the dirt.\n\nI think the wildcard in all this is the fanatical Right. The political hay might not matter to someone who is die hard red. In that sense, maybe the only people to whom this matters is Democrats themselves for the best fundraising efforts. This way, Democrats are kept on message by a concerted effort to fight Trump as opposed to shooting each other in the foot with the Bernie Bros vs the \"I'm With H(illary)\" group. If Trump had been removed by now, then the Democrats would have already started in-fighting about the next presidential election.\n\nSo, the timing now optimizes for:  \n1. Divide trump's attention. campaign or respond to the impeachment?\n\n2. The discovery process will make continual news. leak more and more information so that the impeachment will continually be in the news\n\n3. Force the Republicans to double and triple down on Trump, creating the most amount of political strife\n\n4. Rally the Democrats behind a central goal, something that Democrats have been historically bad at, especially when ahead"}, {"comment_id": "f1cspj5", "post_id": "d8tfpw", "comment": "Pelosi held off on impeachment proceedings as long as she possibly could.  Her master plan was to let the administration self destruct to the point where Trump would be unelectable even in a school board election.

Now this doesn't necessarily guarantee that the House will vote to send it to the Senate for trial, but it will use the full power of the U.S. Government to investigate this matter.  Now, Pelosi is no idiot and was playing this the way she thought was best to get him out of office in an election.

Another 24 hours wasted but it would put it to rest.  \n\nBut, Trump could not help himself and tweets this morning saying I can tell anyone whatever I want so I did it for humanitarian reasons.  No you idiot - we just went through this with Comey's firing.  McMasters went out and said he was there and you did not say anything revealing.

You read that right. THIRTY years. I have tried year after year to get her to switch to someone else, but she figures she has been with them so long and she's doesn't want to go through the effort switching, and the only other option is AT&T anyway. \n\n\nSo last Thursday on Thanksgiving the power goes out, surges the whole neighborhood and everything within 3 or 4 miles around our house. It's out for a couple hours. Bummer since it's Thanksgiving but not the end of the world. Power comes back on, but the cable doesn't work as the box can't seem to get a signal. The issue wasn't the fact that it wasn't working. The issue was how my mom was treated over the phone with Comcast support. \n\n\nMind you, this is a THIRTY YEAR customer -- do the math on how much she has paid over the years. She gets on the phone with support about the box not working, and the lady explains that my mom's issue is her power being out, not the cable, and that my mom needs to hire an electrician. The issue though is that the power has been back on for a couple hours now, and my mom is even using her landline phone to call support. She explains that the power is back on and has been for a couple of hours but the cable box still isn't working. \n\n\nThe lady then goes on to try to convince my mom that only her house's power went out, and no one else's (how would she know anyway?), and that, again, she needs to hire an electrician. I'm literally listening to this lady try to convince my mom that no one else's power went out except for hers. My mom is relentless so the lady finally agreed she would send someone out on Friday. \n\n\nGuy shows up the next day and spends literally half the day (felt bad for the guy) trying to fix the cable. No go. Finally he goes to my mom and says that she has a bad cable line and that, surprise surprise, she needs to hire an electrician to fix it. We're talking hundreds of dollars, if not thousands, to replace this cable line. \n\n\nMy mom is so aggravated that after the guy leaves, she calls support again. This time the person lets her know that since the problem wasn't with their service but is with her wiring that an electrician needs to fix, that she will be needing to pay for the Comcast service guy coming out and spending half a day with her. Unbelievable. \n\n\nIronically, my sister was messing around with the box that night and saw in the settings that there was an upgrade option that needed to go through. Clicked that and amazingly the box worked instantly. 2 minute fix to a problem the tech spent all day on. \n\n\nMy mom called back and I have never seen her so irate at another person in my life. Basically accused them of sending someone out who didn't know what he was doing and also pointing out that they tried, multiple times, to try and dump her off and then even billed her for the guy's time. \n\n\nFortunately she got the bill waived, and in good faith, the customer representative offered to send out one of their own contractors on Saturday, the next day, to check the cable line for free. The only requirement would be that she needed to be at the house from 8AM to 8PM. My mom is an empty nester and all the family is in town, so obviously she wanted to spend time with everyone but instead had to house sit (which we were happy to hang out with her). \n\n\nNow the kicker. The service guy never showed, so my mom waited all day for no reason.

For legal reasons, both need to cooperate very well, exchanging information, from warranted spying to bulk data collection, to looking for words that 'flag' emails and searches. ISP's need government support, and the government needs ISP's to maintain online internet dominance globally and locally. \n\nUp until this point, there has been no legal means to censor the internet. Websites that have terrorist activity, or activity that is not in line with the _state's objectives_ need to be censored. Part of that global dominance from a military perspective is not only piracy and ddos attacks on anti-state websites, but censorship.\n\nRegardless of what America wants, it's part of National Security to find means and ways to legally censor the internet. Suddenly, the fact that Black men were injected with syphallus in the 60's suddenly vanishes. The fact that Reagan sold crack cocaine to fund the Contras and buy weapons, vanishes. Terrorist websites also take forever to load. \n\nThis is the next step that must happen. Otherwise, the FISA court will do what it did to Yahoo: set up a million dollar a day fine until it complies with the NSA directive: military dominance over the internet.\n\nI am not sure if anyone realized but when Egypt toppled over a Facebook video, suddenly every government stood up globally and took notice of the power of Facebook. The power of sharing video and information. Suddenly, the internet became something that could create massive problems for sitting governments. A kill switch had to be installed. Censorship had to be installed. A way and means to force ISP's to do the government's bidding had to be coming.\n\nThis repeal does all of those things. \n\nSuddenly, access to websites that don't support the state will take a very long time to access. The Pirate Bay will be inaccessible. Chinese servers will be inaccessible. Muslim websites will be inaccessible. They will just take hours to load, or not load at all. \n\nLooking for data that Climate change is real? It might take an hour to load, if not more. Looking for data that the Dakota Pipeline leak caused massive environmental damage might take longer than normal. Netflix might take a little longer to get your videos, and your price will go up, as Comcast will now be in the Netflix Business. \n\nThis on the surface is about fast lanes. Underneath, it's about censorship, and enemies of the state. Because of that, it's doubtful your opinion matters to those in power."}, {"comment_id": "dqjrxcy", "post_id": "7gfs84", "comment": "I got news for all these motherfuckers: I'll just read books. \n\nI was born before the internet motherfuckers.

Let me spell it out for you in the simplest, clearest terms:\n\nFor many of you who are younger than 40, 2018 is the single most important election of your lives.\n\nIt is your last chance to end the republican cleptocracy and give control of the republican party back to moderate, sane conservatives. It is your last chance to protect the artifices of government that make the good parts of life in America possible. What is happening politically in this country today is NOT. NORMAL. This is not business as usual. We are experiencing an ideological insurgency that is profoundly anti-humanist and it will impact literally everything. If these people are not primaried in 2018, they will install Supreme Court justices who will dictate the direction of the US for decades to come; for many of you, for the rest of your lives.\n\nMany of you are too young to have voted in a serious election like this. You weren't around during the world wars, nor for the civil rights revolution. The stakes have never been this high for you. Formative moments in national history are not common. They don't necessarily even come around once a generation.\n\nAnd this generation isn't ready for it. You are on the eve of blowing it for yourselves and your countrymen. You have one year to unfuck yourselves and learn the importance of engaging the process or you lose any remaining access to the America you were promised, along with any hope of rebuilding what was lost.

I had barely a scrap of ground under my feet and was feeling like I could fall off the deep end at any moment. In a moment of clarity I decided I should watch some documentaries about real people in the world, to try and keep me grounded. So I searched Netflix, and The Layover came up. I had never heard of it, or Bourdain. But I watched an episode, and then another. And for months every morning I would wake up and watch another Anthony Bourdain episode. There was something about it that helped me keep it together, and it ultimately made me realize I didn't have to stay where I was, that I shouldn't feel afraid to go somewhere else, which I did, which was the best thing I could have done. An added benefit was that I also learned how to cook, and his beef bourguignon and roasted chicken are staples for me.

Sure we deal with a lot of pain and suffering, but it's the pain and suffering that we end up causing others, due to our mental illnesses, is what is unbearable.  Dealing with people like us is exhausting.  We know - we have to put up with ourselves everyday.  We know it's not easy and we love you for it, but, there may come a time, for some people, where they feel ending their lives will end up causing their loved ones less pain in the long run.  If we kill ourselves we know it would hurt those around us, but, if it makes sense that ending our lives would be statistically beneficial to those we love most it may be enough to give the individual the rational that they need to go through with it.  \n\nSo the next time someone kills themselves - think of the pain that they are trying to protect their loved ones from.  We know our mental illnesses wreak havoc on those around us and it torments many of us to the point of separation/no-contact or even death/suicide.  \n\nSo if you really want people to \"reach out\" be prepared for what that means.

It breaks a lot of stereotypes you may have about the region and explores the culture in detail.

I became obsessed. This guy was a character! He had his demons, just like me, but he still found beauty amidst it all. In the littlest things you\u2019d never even think of as a kid growing up in Jersey. And his confidence, wow.  The guy was surrounded by an aura of bravado. I could only dream of being that confident. Watching his show transported me. And, in my own way, I decided to join him.\n\nI packed up all of my possessions into a small suitcase and moved to Spain. I ended up meeting my soul mate, and we now share a beautiful life in sunny California with two incredible little girls. I don\u2019t like giving credit to others for my own success in life. Coming to terms with my OCD took 30 years and a lot of hard work. No one gets credit for that but me and my girls. But I can\u2019t doubt that Bourdain inspired me.\n\nA couple months into my relationship with my wife we got on a train with a friend and headed to a little town north of Barcelona called Villasar de Mar. I drug them away from the beautiful beach to walk aimlessly through this little coastal village until we found a tiny tapas bar. We went in, had some tapas and a beer or two, and chatted with the owner. Then, my wife and I stood outside, the sea at our backs, and my friend took a picture of us. Why this small spot amongst thousands of others in Catalunya? Because I had seen it on No Reservations. It was my homage to someone who helped me when I needed it.

To steal a meme from one of Verne\u2019s movies: \u201cI drink because I\u2019m depressed, and I\u2019m depressed because I drink!\u201d.  If you\u2019re depressed and you relapse, the addition of alcohol is going to stoke the flames of your depression and trap your mind in a vicious downward spiral that can be very difficult to escape.  Once you\u2019re deep enough into it, you kinda stop being yourself.  I\u2019ve been there a few times before, and I\u2019m pretty lucky to be alive still.  If you suffer from depression or alcoholism ask for help.  Doesn\u2019t matter if you ask a friend, family member, coworker, professional or a stranger like me on Reddit, just ask someone.  It\u2019s really hard to deal with either of these illnesses on your own.

Ignoring the scientific arguments over climate change, and the actual legislation of the agreement and how effective/realistic its lofty goals are, the agreement doesn't 'start' until November of 2019. After 2019, the Paris Climate Accords state that the withdrawing of a member cannot actually start until a year after that, which is right after the 2020 Presidential Election.\n\n\nHowever, the United States could pull out of the 1992 U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change treaty [UNFCCC] as early as next year [2018]. The Paris Accords are built off this treaty that has already been ratified. A way to understand this would be to think that the UNFCCC are the objectives, and the Paris Climate Accords are a set of annual guidelines and goals to meet those objectives. The Paris Climate Accords' goals and guidelines were 'approved' by Obama via executive order [i.e not a treaty]. \n\n\nWell, the UNFCCC is a Senate-approved treaty, and good luck getting that through the Senate. You might hear today from Trump that he will pull out of the UNFCCC, with or without the Senate. If the Trump Administration was so bold [stupid] as to unilaterally pull out of the UNFCCC...well, that would be a massive violation of US Constitutional law, international laws, norms, and precedence. This would undoubtedly result in massive financial repercussions and deal an irreparable blow the the international reputation of the USA.\n\n\nAnyways, this treaty is basically pointless today, as market forces [i.e. consumers] are already driving energy efficiency and lowering emissions. Coal is less popular because gas, wind, and solar are so prolific in 2017. Sorry coal. Helloooo free market. Electric cars are booming and even my humble Kansas City's energy company KCP&L is leading the country in charging location for E-vehicles to sell underutilized energy. There are a dozen of these bad boys my work's parking lots and are usually in use. Battery technology is getting better and the cars are getting cooler.\n\n\nLast, State governments have proposed/are proposing their own plans that are even more ambitious than the Paris Climate Accords. California has a 50% energy from renewable-sources by 2030 goal and 100% by 2045 and these larger states tend to drive the future policies of smaller states. Tax-credits and government-funded retraining opportunities have made wind and solar very profitable and have generated hundreds of thousands of new, high-paying labor jobs in the US that do not require blowing up mountain tops, getting cancers, or getting policed by corrupt unions.\n\n\nTrump's move to withdraw is purely political; another inadvisable move with questionable optics to please his increasingly-shrinking base, and fulfill yet another campaign promise. The Paris Climate Accords and UNFCCC did their job: Planting the seed of industry moving to new energy sources and standards, as businesses and governments have been anticipating the treaty for decades in conjunction with increasingly-effective energy technology and demand. Don't be upset to see them go away [in 2020].\n\nSources: \n\nhttp://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2017/02/14/514517425/in-americas-heartland-a-power-company-leads-charge-for-electric-cars \n\nhttp://www.snopes.com/2017/06/01/authority-paris-agreement\n\nhttp://www.npr.org/2017/05/31/530929869/president-trump-expected-to-make-decision-on-paris-climate-accord\n\nhttp://fortune.com/2016/05/17/california-50-percent-clean-energy-goal"}, {"comment_id": "dibyy7b", "post_id": "6ep9fd", "comment": "\"When the last tree is cut, the last river poisoned, and the last fish dead, we will discover that we can\u2019t eat money.\" - Alanis Obomsawin"}, {"comment_id": "dibyvlm", "post_id": "6ep9fd", "comment": "Jesus.

That might mean that Rosenstein viewed it as unrelated to the Mueller jurisdiction, or it might mean something else caused it, we don't know. We also know its Federal, so its not a State-crimes that people are always going on about. \n\nThey raided Cohen's home, his hotel and his office for documents. (Much like with Manafort) Some of which related to Stormy Daniels. Its unclear what was obtained, if anything, related to Mueller's work. If something IS obtained related to Mueller's work I imagine that will be handed off to Mueller. [This was a court authorized search, meaning there was sufficient probable cause for a federal judge to agree that a search involving the President\u2019s personal attorney could occur without any advance notice to Cohen.](https://twitter.com/S_Fitzpatrick/status/983445154056073221) FBI is currently [reported to still be on-scene at Cohen's hotel. ](https://twitter.com/kylegriffin1/status/983453302305296385)\n\nNow with Stormy they [could be looking into Cohen possibly hire people to threaten her](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/982599066260353025), they [could be looking at the financial involvement of payments](https://twitter.com/jimrutenberg/status/973217581409632256) or also [try to determine if Trump himself knew. ](https://twitter.com/MichaelAvenatti/status/983080338057580544)\n\nOn the Russia side of things, if this is actually related to Mueller then it could be about the [Peace Plan with Sater and Flynn](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/us/politics/donald-trump-ukraine-russia.html), or it could be about [the Trump Tower Moscow deal that never took off](https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2017/08/the-curious-link-between-trumps-moscow-tower-deal-and-a-ukraine-peace-plan/) or it might even be related to the claims in the Steele Dossier, that he was paying off hackers. At the very least the recent news of Stormy payments adds plausibility to the idea that Cohen pays off Trump's problems. An odd coincidence if Steele wasn't aware of Stormy or other situations of Cohen doing this.\n\nWhether crimes are related to either of those, both, or neither, the evidence gathered can be used for either case if its related. And any new crimes that turn up might lead to completely different problems for Cohen/Trump. \n\n[Trump's been watching the reports, so it'll be fun to see his reaction either way.](https://twitter.com/stevebruskCNN/status/983444351660560384)\n\nBonus note : [Attorney-client privilege is voided in an investigation when you use that privilege to further a crime or fraud.](https://twitter.com/Tom_Winter/status/983448336970764291), and the FBI strictly sets up teams to avoid causing problems with Attorney-Client privilege situations. \n\nUpdate 1 : [The firm Cohen partnered with last year has dumped him and is fully cooperating with the FBI. ](https://twitter.com/dfriedman33/status/983457389126078464)\n\nUpdate 2 : [Michael Cohen is under investigation for possible bank fraud and campaign finance violations, a person familiar with case tells WaPo.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/fbi-seizes-records-related-to-stormy-daniels-in-raid-of-trump-attorney-michael-cohens-office/2018/04/09/e3e43cf4-3c30-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?utm_term=.8d5a1c72dcfe)   \n\nUpdate 3: \n\n[Trump goes on a rant which you can watch here](https://www.cbsnews.com/live/video/20180409222835-senior-military-officials-brief-trump-about-the-incident-in-syria/) \" So I just heard they broke into the office of one of my attorneys, good man, and its a disgraceful situation its a total witch-hunt I've been saying it for a long time I've wanted to keep it down, we've given, I believe over a million pages worth of documents to the Special Counsel. They continue to just go forward and here we are talking about Syria, we're talking about a lot of serious things with the greatest fighting force ever and I have this witch-hunt constantly going on for over 12 months now, and actually much more than that you could say it was right after I won the nomination it started. And its a disgrace its frankly a real disgrace. Its an attack on our country in a true sense its an attack on what we all stand for so when I saw this and when I heard it - I heard it like you did, I said that is really now on a whole new level on unfairness. \n\n\"So this has been going on, I saw this on one of the reporter's who was not necessarily a fan of mine, not necessarily very good to me he said in effect that this is ridiculous this is now getting ridiculous. They found no collusion whatsoever with *Russia* the reason they found it is there was no collusion at all no collusion.\"\n\n\"This is the most biased group of people - these people have the biggest conflicts of interests I've ever seen. Democrats all - or just about all, either democrats or a couple of republicans that worked for President Obama. They are not looking at the other side, they are not looking at the Hillary Clinton horrible things that she did and all of the crimes that were committed. They are not looking at all of things that happened that everybody is every angry about I can tell you from the Republican side and I think even the Independent side. They only keep looking at us. So they find no collusion and then they go from there and they say well lets keep going and they raid an office of a personal attorney early in the morning and I think its a disgrace. \"\n\n\"So we'll be talking about it more. But this is the most conflicted group of people I've ever seen. The Attorney General made a terrible mistake when he did this and when he recused himself or he should have certainly let us know if he was going to recuse himself and we would have used a-put a different attorney general in. So he made what I consider to be a very terrible mistake for the country but you'll figure that out. All I can say is that after looking for a long period of time and even before the Special Counsel because it really started just about from the time I won the nomination and you look at what took place and what happened and its a disgrace. Its a disgrace.\" \n\n\"I've been President now for what seems like a lengthy period of time we've done a fantastic job we've beaten ISIS we have just about caliphate or the land. Our Economy is incredible the stock market dropped a lot today as soon as they heard the noise you know of the nonsense that's going on, it dropped a lot, it was up, way up and then it dropped quite a bit at the end, a lot. But that we have to go through that we've had that hanging over us for now from the very very beginning and yet the other side they don't even bother looking. And the other side is where there are crimes. And those crimes are obvious. Lies under oath, all over the place. Emails that are knocked out, that are acid washed and deleted. Nobody has ever seen. 30,000 emails deleted after getting a subpoena from Congress and nobody bothers looking at that, and many many other things so I just think that it's a disgrace that a thing like this can happen. \"\n\nQnA portion related to Cohen : \n\nQ:  \"Any Concerns about what the FBI might find Mr.President?\" -   \nTrump : \"No\"\n\nQ: \"Some question about firing Mueller, inaudible- \"           \n\nTrump : \"Why don't I just fire Mueller? Well I think its a disgrace what's going on and we'll see what happens but I think its really a sad situation when you look at what happened and many people have said you should fire him, again, they found nothing and in finding nothing that's a big statement. If you know the person whose in charge of the investigation you know all about that deputy Rosenstein, Rod Rosenstein, he wrote the letter very critical of Comey. One of the things they said I fired Comey. Well I turned out to do the right thing because you look at all of the things he's done and the lies and you look at what's gone on at the FBI and the insurance policy and all  of the things that happened it turned out I did the right thing. But he signed, as you know he also signed the FISA warrant. So Rosenstein who is in charge of this signed a FISA warrant and he also signed a letter that was essentially saying to fire James Comey. And he was right about that, he was absolutely right. So we'll see about that. I think its disgraceful and so do a lot of people this is a pure and simple witch hunt.\n\n\nA Legal analysis thread can be read [here](https://twitter.com/renato_mariotti/status/983468444212482048) hopefully answers some questions people asked me. \n\nI'll add to this if more useful information comes up, or try to fix stuff I got wrong.

The reason being that the technology for them isnt capable for their high prescription flow. (Eg, 6lpm and above) Also in Canada only two provinces still use liquid oxygen. Those provinces are Alberta and Ontario. I live in Ontario so I do the liquid o2 deliveries as you. Also in the province of Ontario, you have to qualify for a poc.

You can hear them mention PBG and Pappy Gang in the video they streamed. \n\nI'm pretty sure they made the victim yell \"Fuck Munchie\" at one point near the end. That's one of the dead gang members of an enemy gang (Loyalty Over Cash IIRC.. Munchie was killed at age 19, I think, and was rumored to have killed or ordered the hit on Pooh Bear. Pappy, in turn, claimed to have had a part in killing Munchie before he was himself killed. And so the cycle continues..)\n\n(One of the accused in the video is an aspiring drill rapper who I won't name due to fear of misidentification and out of respect for the rules.)\n\n**Nothing can ever explain or excuse what they did to this poor young man.**\n\nBeating him, making him drink toilet water, cutting him with a knife, slapping him, repeatedly saying they'd kill him, etc, all while forcing him to repeatedly denounce Trump and carrying on with racist screeds. \n\nIt's interesting to note that at least some of the people in this video deal with violence and death _constantly_, and have done so from an early age. When people say there is a _cultural_ problem of violence and a moral vacuum in some inner cities, this is what they are talking about. \n\nThe casual way they engage in their evil and violence is shocking enough. But the laughter, all along assuming that anyone who saw the video would be impressed (their own gang) or terrorized (their enemies) is just unbearable to witness. .\n\nJust so sad to see this happening in our nation. \n\nThey held this poor fellow for 24-48 hours, and it's reported one of them was his classmate. How terrifying for him, and such betrayal from someone he thought he knew. He is reportedly mentally ill as well Just tears in my eyes. \n\nThis is never going to stop until we realize that _most_ people, of all races, colors and creeds, just want to live their lives and get along. \n\n*Endlessly dividing us through identity politics and dehumanizing \"the enemy\" doesn't solve anything. Please, please stop it.*\n\n**THE WAGES OF IDENTITY POLITICS IS HATE.**\n\n----\n\nEdit: \n\nI should be really clear about this in this post (as I've explained elsewhere). I don't know what life was like for the four perpetrators featured in the video. Given what I know about PBG and at least one of the individuals, I do feel confident saying that they were probably surrounded by violence and violent role models for a long time now.\n\nBut they are adults. They have free will. They are responsible for their decisions and the evil they commit. \n\nMy point is that the _cultural_ problems aren't going to go away on their own. There are thousands of other children and teens in our nation who, tonight, will walk the streets selling drugs, watching the shadows for enemies, desperately thinking about whether there is any hope or future for them at all. \n\nReductive \"solutions\" like \"gun control\", \"get tough on crime\", etc, aren't likely to fix a problem whose root is at least partially cultural and economic. \n\nAnd things like \"blame institutional racism\" actually make the situation far, far, worse, IMO. \n\nWe need to be willing to stare into the face of evil and find out why it manifests in this way, sometimes just a few blocks away from relatively \"normal\" areas.

These sentencing guidelines are a good thing, numbers aside.]\n\nI see a bunch of comments from people that don't get the \"and/or\" thing.  I want to clarify it, because it's important to understand how it works and why it's there in the sentencing guidelines.  At the Judge's discretion, he can use use either punishment, or both. This is a good thing. Mandatory sentences are not a good thing, in my opinion. Flexibility is important. Circumstances and intent matter. Look at these two examples:\n\nscenario#1: Joe, a steelworker in Irontown, leaves for work on Monday. Distracted by fatigue, a hangover, and his pressing credit card debt, he backs out of his driveway without first doing a 360 check and he kills a pedestrian. He's wrought with guilt and remorse, drowning in more debt from legal fees and from being fired well before his trial. The Judge, when considering Joe's sentence, decides that jailing Joe would serve no purpose, but that a moderate fine, some community service and a criminal record will be a just punishment.\n\nscenario#2: The situation in Flint, where a handful of people knowingly poisoned a large community. The Judge could decide that some of the defendants are more culpable than others, and levy fines on some and lengthy prison sentences on the others.\n\nI'm not a lawyer, and I guess that vehicular manslaughter is different than 'regular' manslaughter, but you get what I'm saying? It's not like the defendants get to pick between jail or a fine.  The Judge chooses a combination of both, or just one.  It gives them a lot of latitude in sentencing.

They turned the beautiful library into a gym and cut art and music programs to build a massive football stadium. \n\nEdit*** ok wow I didn't expect this comment to explode!  I'm not saying I don't think a good athletics program isn't important folks, my problem is that it's going straight to the boy's football team and not much elsewhere.  \n\nA bit of backstory, in 2001 the school used tax money to build a multimillion dollar stadium, but they ALSO built that awesome library at the same time.  Fair enough, right?   Well I'm guessing that big stadium brought in enough money to do the big remodel that happened around 2011.   However, they cut a shit load of arts, music, language and drama programs while I was in high school between 2005 and 2009.  Then they go and turn that sick af library and computer lab into a fucking gym.  We already had 3 gyms, including a soft floor wrestling gym that was put in during that first remodel. \n\nSo here's the boy's football team getting bathed in money, yet the girls' teams and the less popular boy sports teams are out begging for money along the roads every weekend during their seasons as fundraisers.  It's not okay to lift up one tiny, tiny percentage of students but ignore the rest of the population.   They also cut a lot of AP science  and language programs too, that's not cool!  I had to go from French III to French V Honors because they cut languages and didn't have enough teachers for every level.  That sucked, I struggled keeping up with the more advanced students but I really wanted to learn French and I'd already devoted several years to it. \n\nJust because some kids might not be interested in science, languages or music, doesn't mean you should punish the ones who are.  We're all in school to learn and develop interests that will build us into adults, how can all kids do this if they're blocked from participating in things they're interested in?

It was CHAOS and we are still dealing with the effects.  \n\nMy school was broken up into three small schools located in the same building.  The idea was to give students smaller learning communities so they have more support.  Great idea in theory, but when you add in the legal requirements certain groups of students have (i.e. special education and ELL students) small schools do not have the capacity to address those needs AND provide a range of course selections and opportunities for students.  Also, the administrative overhead for each school was astronomically expensive and inefficient and not sustainable.  Naturally funding ran out, scores were not improving as desired, and they (Gates Foundation and school districts) dropped the initiative. However, once you break up a school into different schools, re-merging the schools back together is not as simple as it seems. It is a messy process where the students generally bear the brunt of the harm. \n\nI am glad that the new funding will be given with the expectation that those within the school and school district will mandate the changes.  Hopefully that will actually help solve some of the very real problems on the ground.  This will be a departure from reforms that make a bunch of changes that sound good in a press release, but actually screw over students or are ineffective.

The international community began stopping and detaining their ships as they tried to make trades in Russia and Syria.\n\nIn previous engagements European leaders were very anti-American. New leadership since then (especially France) were much younger and were willing to take a new approach.

I'm talking about the criminal justice system as a whole in the US. \n\nMost of the time, a prison sentence is not what these people need. They need reform, which doesn't come with sitting in a prison. They need to be institutionalized for their mental illnesses, because that's what pedophilia is. A mental illness. Harming children in any way is an unforgivable act, and we should be making these people less dangerous to society; less likely to repeat the same crimes. That is not what our prison system encourages, for any type of criminal. \n\nThe prison system is a money making machine, its not actually set out to help the criminals or help to keep society safe from them. If it were, prison terms would be spent in reform, getting intensive psychiatric care, with a focus on lowering the risk of repeat offenders. But that's too expensive and not financially lucrative enough, so it doesn't work that way here. Instead our government encourages the cycle of violence to continue, and they bank on the fact that criminals will end up back in jail. \n\nThis is what causes guards to feel justified in assisting in the beating/killing of a child molester, and prisoners to feel justified in doing the beating. They know better than anyone that these criminals will likely end up doing the same evil things over again. \n\nNow once again I'm not stating whether or not I agree with the sentiment that he should have died, I'm simply criticizing the justice system for its shortcomings and lack of concern for the population by not doing everything they can to make sure these criminals don't repeat their crimes, and why that might push inmates and guards to behave this way toward child sex criminals.

Moderately sized facility run by a family of deeply devout Christians. The job was full of spiteful \u201chun\u201d women who would relentlessly try to defend their \u201cmain jobs\u201d (ie and MLM, like Lularu (sp?) or Herbalife). Aside from the occasional \u201cfuck you\u201d from cold calls the job wasn\u2019t half bad and it gave some insight into an industry I was relatively unaware of. The biggest caveat was they had a weekly \u201cbible lunch\u201d where food was bought like pizza or street tacos. Enough for everyone that worked there, but, (and this is a big but) you had to eat the food sitting in the same room with the most annoyingly pushy Christian women, the company\u2019s very elderly owners, and their eldest son who ran  the day to day operations. Anyway it would open slowly the CEO would say hello to new faces and welcome returning employees, then bam! He would start with a chapter and verse and lay right reading directly from the King James version of the Bible...out loud. At one point we where subjected to the most depressingly sad films to ever exist, \u201cThe Bible\u201d, one hour segments a week plus a 10-15 break/post discussion all...paid! Now you might think,\n\n \u201cHey free food, a movie, and a dedicated weekly book club all rolled into one experience, at work, for one hour or more, paid?! Oh sign me up!\u201d \n\nWell slow down there high-speed. Let me remind you the company owners are there in the room and the CEO. And they don\u2019t just want to talk to you about this book. They want you to agree with their interpretations of it too. Even when those interpolations are against everything in your core that would tell you otherwise. Disagreement, (specifically over a woman\u2019s right to wear \u201cskimpy\u201d clothing, a man to have his ear\u2019s pierced,  or if \u201cthe gays\u201d should marry (hadn\u2019t become a right yet).  \n\n\u201cRotten,\u201d is the term I think the old hag used and I a straight, 30 year old, budding atheist, disabled, Naval submarine vet, who lived through both the don\u2019t ask don\u2019t tell policy as well as it\u2019s repeal couldn\u2019t help but disagree with the gays are rotten comment. I love the gays! Some of my best memories in the service, and since I\u2019ve been out are meeting with, and spending time getting to know the most wonderful gay men, and women, of all shapes, colors, and sizes. All any of them ever wanted was to just live and love to their fullest potential. I see nothing wrong with either of those things. Now, after months of listening to this old boomer blabber on about gay agendas, and the impending apocalypse I\u2019d had just about enough. She said \u201crotten,\u201d and I snapped\n\n\u201cTheir isn\u2019t anything rotten about gays!....\u201d I said. \n\nYou could hear a pin drop.\n\n....\u201dWell\u201d said the CEO awkwardly...\u201dI think we\u2019ve about covered (insert whatever passage no one really gives a damn about). Next week we\u2019ll cover...(insert chapter and verse of book blah here).\u201d Then people start cleaning up the plates and left over food to be placed in the employee Lunch/break room ( I feel like I should also add the \u201cbible studies\u201d took place in the room they did the focus groups in). Anyway the next week they ordered pizza, and I just so happened to be behind on making my call quota so I wanted to just eat real fast and get back to work. So I went and helped bring the pizza and soda in, then grabbed a few slices of pizza, ate them in just a few minutes standing up, and then started to head back to my desk. As I was leaving the old female owner shuffles in as I\u2019m trying to go out. I step back suddenly remembering last weeks awkward meeting and I say (nervously), \u201c Well hello Mrs. Crabappletreeson.\u201d \u201cShe just nodded and said hello.\u201d Now she knew my name and had always called me by my full name, Matthew. But no hello Matthew today, just a short dismissive hello. The very next day I was asked to come to my bosses office. He told me that the original full time position the company offered me was no longer available as they where \u201cdownsizing.\u201d However, a part time position is available and I was welcome to have it. The PT shift was the evening shift so I wouldn\u2019t be around when the owner was and no more Bible lunch. I worked during the day, had my own desk, full benefits. Now suddenly half pay, just over half the hours, no benefits. I was SOL for another job cuse I wasn\u2019t expecting to be suddenly demoted. I stuck it out on the PT schedule. Wound up sharing a desk with the most obnoxious woman on the planet who heard all about my bible lunch theft and would regularly end our nights with a \u201cI\u2019ll pray for you.\u201d Or \u201cI just know Jesus has a plan for you.\u201d Stuck it out for a few more weeks until I got a new job, but damn they didn\u2019t make it easy, Plus I found out from my new boss that the place I was working at currently didn\u2019t give me a good reference. But they hired me anyway cuse all my other references where supportive and I was the best candidate.

Second, illegal traders, were able to sneak their poached ivory into the legal supply, which reduced their risk.\n\n3. The end, *unintended* result was a lot more dead elephants.\n\nSo to summarize, this is China rolling back a well-intentioned but bad policy decision and returning to their original official position, which is that ivory is bad.\n\nTo make it actually stick and make a difference, they need to enforce the ban consistently and roll out a big education campaign to teach people why ivory is unethical."}, {"comment_id": "drzz96z", "post_id": "7n8lz5", "comment": "Very good news.
