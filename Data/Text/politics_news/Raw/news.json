It has to do with McCain\u2019s military background and Vietnam combat and the five-plus years he spent in a North Vietnamese prison, mostly in solitary, in a box, getting tortured and starved. And the unbelievable honor and balls he showed there. \n\nIt's very easy to gloss over the POW thing, partly because we've all heard so much about it and partly because it\u2019s so off-the \u2013 charts dramatic, like something in a movie instead of a man's life. But it\u2019s worth considering for a minute, because it\u2019s what makes McCain's \"causes greater than self-interest\" line easier to hear.\n\nYou probably already know what happened. \n\nIn October of '67 McCain was himself still a Young Voter and \ufb02ying his 23rd Vietnam combat mission and his A-4 Skyhawk plane got shot down over Hanoi and he had to eject, which basically means setting off an explosive charge that blows your seat out of the plane, which ejection broke both McCain's arms and one leg and gave him a concussion and he started falling out of the skies right over Hanoi. \n\nTry to imagine for a second how much this would hurt and how scared you'd be, three limbs broken and falling toward the enemy capital you just tried to bomb. His chute opened late and he landed hard in a little lake in a park right in the middle of downtown Hanoi, \n\nImagine treading water with broken arms and trying to pull the life vest's toggle with your teeth as a crowd of Vietnamese men swim out toward you (there's film of this, somebody had a home \u2013 movie camera, and the N.V. government released it, though it's grainy and McCain's face is hard to see). The crowd pulled him out and then just about killed him. \n\nU.S. bomber pilots were especially hated, for obvious reasons. McCain got bayoneted in the groin; a soldier broke his shoulder apart with a ri\ufb02e butt. Plus by this time his right knee was bent 90-degrees to the side with the bone sticking out. Try to imagine this. \n\nHe finally got tossed on a jeep and taken five blocks to the infamous Hoa Lo prison \u2013 a.k.a. the \"Hanoi Hilton,\" of much movie fame \u2013 where they made him beg a week for a doctor and finally set a couple of the fractures without anesthetic and let two other fractures and the groin wound (imagine: groin wound) stay like they were. Then they threw him in a cell. Try for a moment to feel this. All the media profiles talk about how McCain still can't lift his arms over his head to comb his hair, which is true. \n\nBut try to imagine it at the time, yourself in his place, because it's important. Think about how diametrically opposed to your own self-interest getting knifed in the balls and having fractures set without painkiller would be, and then about getting thrown in a cell to just lie there and hurt, which is what happened. \n\nHe was delirious with pain for weeks, and his weight dropped to 100 pounds, and the other POWs were sure he would die; and then after a few months like that after his bones mostly knitted and he could sort of stand up they brought him in to the prison commandant's office and offered to let him go. This is true. They said he could just leave. They had found out that McCain's father was one of the top-ranking naval officers in the U.S. Armed Forces (which is true \u2013 both his father and grandfather were admirals), and the North Vietnamese wanted the PR coup of mercifully releasing his son, the baby-killer. \n\nMcCain, 100 pounds and barely able to stand, refused, The U.S. military's Code of Conduct for Prisoners of War apparently said that POWs had to be released in the order they were captured, and there were others who'd been in Hoa Lo a long time, and McCain refused to violate the Code. \n\nThe commandant, not pleased, right there in the office had guards break his ribs, rebreak his arm, knock his teeth out. McCain still refused to leave without the other POWs. And so then he spent four more years in Hoa Lo like this, much of the time in solitary, in the dark, in a closet-sized box called a \"punishment cell.\" \n\nMaybe you've heard all this before; it's been in umpteen different media profiles of McCain. But try to imagine that moment between getting offered early release and turning it down. Try to imagine it was you. \n\nImagine how loudly your most basic, primal self-interest would have cried out to you in that moment, and all the ways you could rationalize accepting the offer. Can you hear it? It so, would you have refused to go? You simply can't know for sure. None of us can. It's hard even to imagine the pain and fear in that moment, much less know how you'd react. \n\nBut, see, we do know how this man reacted. That he chose to spend four more years there, in a dark box, alone, tapping code on the walls to the others, rather than violate a Code. Maybe he was nuts. But the point is that with McCain it feels like we know, for a proven fact, that he\u2019s capable of devotion to something other, more, than his own self-interest. So that when he says the line in speeches in early February you can feel like maybe it isn't just more candidate bullshit, that with this guy it's maybe the truth.\n\nOr maybe both the truth and bullshit: the guy does \u2013 did \u2013 want your vote, after all.\n\nBut that moment in the Hoa Lo office in '68 \u2013 right before he refused, with all his basic normal human self-interest howling at him \u2013 that moment is hard to blow off.\"\n\nFrom Rolling Stone \nby David Foster Wallace, 2000"}, {"comment_id": "e4udn67", "post_id": "9abi3e", "comment": "You have me crying.

Some accounts from fellow prisoners even went so far as to say that, if other prisoners were targeted for interrogation and torture, he would deliberately act aggressively, creating outbursts so that the attention would be drawn to him, and he would be beaten instead. His limbs and ribs were broken and re-broken constantly, and he was never able to completely recover. He endured daily rope beatings for two hours, all the while suffering from dysentery. And yet still, he made sure that the men he was with were taken care of. When his father, John McCain Jr. was named commander of all US forces in Europe, the North Vietnamese attempted to make a deal with him in order to release his son. John McCain III refused, saying that he would not leave the NVA prison unless every single soldier that was there with him was release as well. And then the beatings continued. To this day, he is incapable of raising his arms above his head due to the torture he endured.\n\n>At this point he could have left the military and still been a hell of a war hero. But he didn\u2019t do that. He endured grueling physical therapy all in the hopes of staying in the military, so he could ensure that other members were taken care of. He stayed in the military for 22 years.\n\n>He could have retired to a nice quiet life again at this point, but he didn\u2019t. He still had a desire to change the world. McCain ran for the Senate in 1982, at one point delivering the most devastating political response ever to someone who accused him of district shopping:\n\n>\u201cListen, pal. I spent 22 years in the Navy. My father was in the Navy. My grandfather was in the Navy. We in the military service tend to move a lot. We have to live in all parts of the country, all parts of the world. I wish I could have had the luxury, like you, of growing up and living and spending my entire life in a nice place like the First District of Arizona, but I was doing other things. As a matter of fact, when I think about it now, the place I lived longest in my life was Hanoi.\u201d\n\n>And he stayed in, still championing various bills which he believed would better the world. Now, history has shown us that some of these ideas obviously weren\u2019t the best in retrospect, but he still wanted to leave the world in a better state than he found it.\n\n>In 2008, he ran against Barack Obama for President. I need to note that at this time, he vehemently opposed any notion that he would run ads, or stand on a platform that mudslings. His mentality was that he would run his campaign on a foundation of voters choosing which ideals they wanted represented in office. No cheap shots or insults would be allowed in his campaign. There\u2019s a video on YouTube where he invited an elderly woman on stage who accused Barack Obama of being Arabic. His response? \u201c \u201cNo ma'am. He\u2019s a decent family man, citizen, that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues.\u201d\n\n>And in 2010, while the Republican party was staunchly entrenched against the President, filibustering as much as they could against his policies, one of which was the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t ask, Don\u2019t tell,\u201d it was John McCain who said that, consequences be damned, I\u2019m not going to sit here and try to win a political trench war against everything. This guy has some good ideas, and I\u2019m not going to stop everything he says on principle, I\u2019m going to have some discourse.\n\n>I would also be remiss if I did not mention the fact that he spent his whole life believing that homosexuality is immoral. He was even against the repeal of \u201cDon\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell\u201d But in 2013, he totally reversed his opinion of it. Think about that for a moment. at 76 years old, this man said \u201cyou know what? I was wrong my whole life about something.\u201d That takes mental fortitude that I\u2019ve never personally seen in any individual. Even now, he is a champion of LGBT rights in both the military and America as a whole.\nTo this day, John McCain is the poster child of bipartisanship in politics. He is a man who lives by the phrase \u201cWe might disagree on some things, but we can agree on some things in order to make this world a better place.\u201d\nJohn Sidney McCain III is the the person I strive to be as a soldier, an American, and a human. If I grow to be but a fraction of the person he is, I will consider my life an accomplished one indeed.\n\n>Edit: Holy wow this blew up. Thank you all for the love and gold that's come my way! I want to use this temporary platform to talk about something just as important to me as John McCain is: you. Please don't just read this and forget it. Follow the legacy that he has led his whole life. Go out and be selfless. Be kind. Call your mom. Say hi to your neighbors. Offer to carry groceries for the lady struggling to push a buggy at the grocery store. Go volunteer at the local animal or homeless shelter. I guarantee you, 5 minutes of your time can change someone's world. It's the best way you can honor someone like Senator McCain.

Proponents of net neutrality provided numerous examples of specific anti-consumer practices that ISPs could undertake without net neutrality like throttling traffic to competing streaming services, blocking content outright, charging companies money for fast lanes, etc.\n\nIf the instant net neutrality was repealed, ISPs did the exact opposite of what they promised, and did exactly what proponents of net neutrality warned against, then of course their legal argument falls flat on its face.\n\nSo no, in the short term, nothing is likely to change. When the legal battle starts, opponents of net neutrality are going to say \"See, look, everything is still fine, right? Net neutrality was never needed!\".\n\nWhat we're likely to see instead are very slow and very subtle changes that move more towards the anti-consumer behavior proponents of net neutrality warned about as time passes, and they'll try to do them all as invisibly as possible.

Expanding America\u2019s promise to new immigrants and people with disabilities. Reducing the scourge of nuclear weapons and building a broad international coalition to expel a dictator from Kuwait. And when democratic revolutions bloomed across Eastern Europe, it was his steady, diplomatic hand that made possible an achievement once thought anything but \u2013 ending the Cold War without firing a shot.*  \n>  \n>*It's a legacy of service that may never be matched, even though he\u2019d want all of us to try.*  \n>  \n>*After seventy-three years of marriage, George and Barbara Bush are together again now, two points of light that never dimmed, two points of light that ignited countless others with their example \u2013 the example of a man who, even after commanding the world\u2019s mightiest military, once said \u201cI got more of a kick out of being one of the founders of the YMCA in Midland, Texas back in 1952 than almost anything I\u2019ve done.\u201d*  \n>  \n>*What a testament to the qualities that make this country great. Service to others. Commitment to leaving behind something better. Sacrifice in the name of lifting this country closer to its founding ideals.
