Alone, head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers, Mike Tomlin, strode confidently towards the alien spacecraft currently docked in Washington DC. The invading army had forced humanity to surrender in less than a month, and by this point, humanity was hoping their savior could at least negotiate for guaranteed survival.\n\nThe aliens, which were monstrous creatures that stood around 8 feet tall and wore their power armor at all times, waited for him around a table. Once the alien leader was sat at one end, his guards gestured for Tomlin to take a seat. Instead, he reached into his suit. Laser guns and disintegration rays were instantly pointed at him. Calmly, Mike Tomlin pulled out a camcorder and set it down on the table, and began to speak.\n\n\"Now gentleman, I expect these talks to be short and fruitful, as we are both civilized races. As such, no one needs to be exterminated.\"\n\nThe alien leader looked disgusted as he spoke: \"You know, we expected someone important, like a world leader. Not the captain of some entertainment 'team'. It took my men *minutes* to discover your identity. How DARE they insult us by sending you.\"\n\nMike Tomlin, his once calm face turned cold. His eyes bulged slightly, he formed a frown, and he leaned forward in his seat. \"Insults are the game of boys. We, on the other hand are men. Now talk to me like a man, or I will find someone who will.\"\n\nThe leader, enraged from being passively insulted (by humans not even sending an official diplomat) and directly insulted by Mike Tomlin's words, sprang from his chair and sprinted towards Tomlin. Tomlin didn't flinch as he tried to throw him to the ground, but instead, he found Mike's hands around his own throat.\n\n\"I thought we could do this the easy way, but I guess not.\"\n\nMike Tomlin, before any guard could react, shoved his hand through the leader's armor. Once he was elbow deep into the chest of the alien, the leader began screaming in pain, but it was fruitless. Tomlin removed a handful of guts, and tossed them on the floor as the light from the alien leader's eyes retreated permanently.\n\nTomlin sat back down quietly.\n\n\"I'm sorry that your teammate needed to be punished, however,  my response was swift and appropriate, and I hope we can avoid further conflict. Now that that is over let us return to negotiations.\"\n\nThe guards shuffled quietly, turning their heads away from Tomlin. Tomlin just needed someone to talk to, to negotiate a peace! Was no one up to the job here? He yelled in frustration:\n\n\"Men! You are at the table of the most important event in human history, and here you are closing your eyes to it. Don't you *dare* even fucking blink, or I will rip your eyelids off. Come on. Next man up to the varsity table. No more JV action. I will accept nothing less from you.\"\n\n/*********************\n\nAs Mike Tomlin walked away from the spacecraft, it rapidly floated away from DC. In fact, reports were coming in from all over the world that their ships were leaving. The cheers were deafening.\n\nReporters only had time to ask Tomlin a few quick questions before he was whisked away for debriefing: \"How were the negotiations? How did you convince them to leave? Are we safe?\"\n\nTomlin smirked. \n\n\"I need to review the tape before I can appropriately answer your questions. However, based on the preliminary results,\" he gestures to the lack of the spacecraft, \"I would think that we won the negotiations. Again, let me review the tape and I will get back to you guys on Tuesday.
