The very same behavior he has criticized so many for when it was an issue that mattered to him.\n\nNobody needs a politician here LeBron, they need you as a role model to just say what you believe whether its the perfect thing to say or not, because THAT is what is important.\n\nNobody learns anything from hiding. You say what you believe in, and ask honest questions about what you dont know about, and everyone has a chance to grow and learn.\n\nHiding to try and protect your brand is the EXACT thing that will devalue it and make you look like a cheap phony. It weakens your stance on *everything*, even the things you do know a lot about and want to champion. It's just a weak move to not say what you think. Accept the possibility that you can be wrong or ill-prepared or less informed, because that is the only way you can grow. Nobody says the right thing every time, but I can guarantee you that trying to say nothing is almost always the wrong move. You rob others of a chance to hear a powerful opinion, or on the other hand rob yourself of a chance to learn and be humbled.\n\nSome things are bigger than basketball, and even bigger than a single important event. Some things set a precedent for how a platform is used for *all* events going forward. Dont set the example that you hide from things and only support causes for things that you can see yourself in, because that is not how any type of unity spreads. Expand your horizons, and stand up for your values. Especially when it is difficult and you aren't so positively sure that you're right.

Lot easier to get veterans to want to come for you for the minimum now at the beginning of FA than if you wait till most of them have already signed lol \n\nAlso the fact this is 4 years when LeBron has just done a ton of 1-2 year deals in the past is v interesting. Shows you how little faith he had in Dan Gilbert to pay that absurd tax bill otherwise unless he held leverage of potentially leaving. Because he's not doing that here. If there isn't already a big deal in place he's also clearly willing to trust LAL's FO that they will be willing to trade some of those young players for win now help and spend as much as it takes.
