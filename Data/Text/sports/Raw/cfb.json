At first I kind of assumed that all athletic departments would do due diligence before scheduling their games, I realized that games are scheduled years in advance and scholarship numbers are constantly changing, and given the wild bowl eligibility scenario Florida State had to go through with rescheduling ULM, thought the story would be too great to ignore if it turned out Delaware State wasn't countable.

[FBS]** A contest shall serve the purpose of providing a national contest between deserving teams. A \u201cdeserving team\u201d shall be defined as one that has won a number of games against Football Bowl Subdivision opponents that is equal to or greater than the number of its overall losses. Tie games do not count in determining a team\u2019s won-lost record. Further, when forfeiture of a regular-season football victory is required by the Committee on Infractions or a conference, or is self-imposed by an institution as a result of a violation of NCAA rules, neither of the competing institutions may count that contest in satisfying the definition of a \u201cdeserving team.\u201d (Revised: 10/18/89, 10/12/93, 4/20/99, 12/15/06, 4/29/10 effective 8/1/10, 7/30/10, 10/27/11 effective 4/1/12)\n\n**18.7.2.1.1 Exception\u2014Football Championship Subdivision Opponent.

[FBS]** The Football Issues Committee may approve a waiver of the 90 percent requirement to permit a Football Bowl Subdivision institution to count a victory against a Football Championship Subdivision opponent toward meeting the definition of a \u201cdeserving team,\u201d if a unique or catastrophic situation affects the Football Championship Subdivision institution\u2019s ability to average 90 percent of the permissible maximum number of football grants-in-aid per year during a rolling twoyear period.

[FBS]** For a period of four years beginning August 1, 2016, if an insufficient number of institutions meet the definition of a \u201cdeserving team\u201d pursuant to Bylaw 18.7.2.1 to participate in postseason bowl games in a particular year, an institution that meets a condition set forth below shall be eligible to participate as an alternate in such a bowl game. All deserving teams must be selected before an alternate may be selected. The terms of participation in the bowl game shall be the same for the alternate as the terms that were applicable to the originally contracted conference participant. All institutions that meet the first condition below must be selected before an institution that meets the second condition may be selected and so forth in descending order: (Adopted: 8/2/12, Revised: 5/2/13, 8/4/16 effective 8/1/16, 12/1/16)\n\n**(a)** An institution that would have met the exception in Bylaw 18.7.2.1.1 but for the fact that one victory was against a Football Championship Subdivision opponent that had not averaged 90 percent of the permissible maximum number of grants-in-aid per year in football during a rolling two-year period and the institution\u2019s waiver request, per Bylaw 18.7.2.1.1.1, was denied. \n\nPage 212: \n\n**15.5.6.2 Championship Subdivision Football.
