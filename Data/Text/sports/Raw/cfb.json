[FBS]** A contest shall serve the purpose of providing a national contest between deserving teams. A \u201cdeserving team\u201d shall be defined as one that has won a number of games against Football Bowl Subdivision opponents that is equal to or greater than the number of its overall losses. Tie games do not count in determining a team\u2019s won-lost record. Further, when forfeiture of a regular-season football victory is required by the Committee on Infractions or a conference, or is self-imposed by an institution as a result of a violation of NCAA rules, neither of the competing institutions may count that contest in satisfying the definition of a \u201cdeserving team.\u201d (Revised: 10/18/89, 10/12/93, 4/20/99, 12/15/06, 4/29/10 effective 8/1/10, 7/30/10, 10/27/11 effective 4/1/12)\n\n**18.7.2.1.1 Exception\u2014Football Championship Subdivision Opponent. [FBS]** Each year, a Football Bowl Subdivision institution may count one victory against a Football Championship Subdivision opponent toward meeting the definition of a \u201cdeserving team,\u201d provided the opponent has averaged 90 percent of the permissible maximum number of grants-in-aid per year in football during a rolling two-year period. (Adopted: 10/28/97 effective 8/1/98, Revised: 4/28/05, 12/15/06, 4/29/10 effective 8/1/10, 7/30/10)\n\n**18.7.2.1.1.1 Waiver. [FBS]** The Football Issues Committee may approve a waiver of the 90 percent requirement to permit a Football Bowl Subdivision institution to count a victory against a Football Championship Subdivision opponent toward meeting the definition of a \u201cdeserving team,\u201d if a unique or catastrophic situation affects the Football Championship Subdivision institution\u2019s ability to average 90 percent of the permissible maximum number of football grants-in-aid per year during a rolling twoyear period. (Adopted: 8/11/98, Revised: 4/28/05, 12/15/06, 4/29/10 effective 8/1/10, 7/30/10)\n\n**18.7.2.1.3 Exception\u2014Insufficient Number of Eligible Institutions. [FBS]** For a period of four years beginning August 1, 2016, if an insufficient number of institutions meet the definition of a \u201cdeserving team\u201d pursuant to Bylaw 18.7.2.1 to participate in postseason bowl games in a particular year, an institution that meets a condition set forth below shall be eligible to participate as an alternate in such a bowl game. All deserving teams must be selected before an alternate may be selected. The terms of participation in the bowl game shall be the same for the alternate as the terms that were applicable to the originally contracted conference participant. All institutions that meet the first condition below must be selected before an institution that meets the second condition may be selected and so forth in descending order: (Adopted: 8/2/12, Revised: 5/2/13, 8/4/16 effective 8/1/16, 12/1/16)\n\n**(a)** An institution that would have met the exception in Bylaw 18.7.2.1.1 but for the fact that one victory was against a Football Championship Subdivision opponent that had not averaged 90 percent of the permissible maximum number of grants-in-aid per year in football during a rolling two-year period and the institution\u2019s waiver request, per Bylaw 18.7.2.1.1.1, was denied. \n\nPage 212: \n\n**15.5.6.2 Championship Subdivision Football. [FCSD]** There shall be an annual limit of 30 on the number of initial counters (per Bylaw 15.02.3.1), an annual limit of 63 on the value of financial aid awards (equivalencies) to counters, and an annual limit of 85 on the total number of counters (including initial counters) in football at each Football Championship Subdivision institution.

Auburn ran a simple RPO (run pass option) out of a doubles set with a QB option to pull the ball and throw a screen to the outside. They consistently threw the screen over and over to start the game and it was easy to see why. Bama was beaten on alignment every time. They ran one press corner over the front receiver and a safety with inside leverage 8-12 yards off the secondary receiver to help with the run. There is no way for the safety to make a play on the screening receiver due to being caught in the middle of the field. Stidham simply threw the ball and forced the safety to make a 1 on 1 tackle in space.

He leans forward as if to tell me something wonderful and whispers almost inaudibly, *\u201cBoiler the fuck up\u201d* then kicks me right in the balls and shoves me off the edge to fall into a black and gold room, tied to a chair with my eyes stapled open and Rondale Moore repeatedly spinning a scooter around into my ankles all while mumbling *\u201dSpoilermakers, bitch\u201d* while I\u2019m forced to watch this fucking game on repeat for the rest of eternity.

I don't think the college-style OT would be good for the NFL, though. Kickers are way too accurate to even start with the ball on the opponent's side of the field. At that point, why not just start them at the 25 as if they had a touchback and see what they can do? You're bound to have some inept offenses that _cannot_ score, or some inept defenses that _cannot_ stop the other team.

I failed my first two semesters in college, but I turned it around and got my GPA up to a 3.6. I had excellent grades in calculus, and I was looking at a good engineering program to. The natural choice is UF, duh. They declined me - on a technicality. I needed to finish two more prerequisite classes. Due to the fact that I rely on financial aid, I couldn\u2019t do that, because once you finish a degree, you can\u2019t seek financial aid without a declared major. So I couldn\u2019t take that extra class because I had no financial aid to pay for it. Thinking \u201cTHIS can\u2019t be the reason I don\u2019t get in, right?\u201d I call the UF admissions office, and after some shuffling on the phone, one of the admissions people for their engineering department picks up the phone. She condescends the shit out of me, makes me feel like my GPA ain\u2019t shit, and basically says nice try better luck next time. I was devastated. It felt like my hard work was for nothing\n\nUCF, say what you want about why they do it, they accepted me. They accommodated me. They made sure I could get financial aid while I was undeclared. They accepted me when other, more pretentious schools, wouldn\u2019t.

His O Line besides playing out of their minds, used some great circular protection with the H Back to hold off a defensive line that is one of the best in the country, we got more sacks on Alabama. \nFire the committee or go to an 8 team playoff with a designated g5 slot, you guys deserved a shot in the playoffs \n\nEdit: just wanted to add an addendum, I\u2019m sure some of my terminology is off I\u2019m still learning this stuff but it doesn\u2019t take away how impressed I was "}, {"comment_id": "ds1vavo", "post_id": "7nhtbs", "comment": "[I pure straight hate you, but god damn do I respect you](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/DeliciousHelpfulBoutu-size_restricted.gif)"}, {"comment_id": "ds1vc3s", "post_id": "7nhtbs", "comment": "Auburn wasn't ready for that AAC Speed"}, {"comment_id": "ds1vqcv", "post_id": "7nhtbs", "comment": "Well fucking done UCF. 2017-2018 champions as far as I'm concerned."}, {"comment_id": "ds1vavn", "post_id": "7nhtbs", "comment": "Congrats UCF.

Perhaps it's yours. The college football world goes on discussing it's fake problems (\"will our young defense prevent another title game appearance?\" says the Bama fan), while we sit here with real problems. And nothing, absolutely nothing, seems fair.\n\nI got an email about BTN Tailgate being in Champaign on Saturday. That's BTN's own \"College Gameday\" show where they go to a campus and do a live show at 9:00 am. It was announced before the season that they'd be in Champaign for the Wisconsin game but I forgot about it until this email. Now, it just seems cruel. Why put our faces on TV? Haven't we suffered enough?\n\nI'm probably already losing you. Let me try to explain.\n\nEveryone around our football program, including those at Big Ten headquarters, act as if it's a football program. They pretty much have to. The Big Ten has to spread the love evenly, so if Penn State gets a pregame thing on BTN, Rutgers should get the same thing.\n\nThis is seen on social media as well. Northwestern might go 3-9 this season and Ohio State might go 12-0, but when they play in Evanston on Friday night, the people who run Northwestern's social media are going to behave the same way that the Ohio State social media people will behave. Pregame, act like it's going to be a game. The game might be 48-3 by the end, but pregame, the tweets will be the same (go team, let's do this, \"fight, boys\"). Has to be done. I get it. Everyone behaves as if they have a winning program. You can't have the official Twitter account tweet \"destruction is at our door, gentlemen\".\n\nFor me (and probably for some Rutgers fan out there), that kind of thing feels increasingly insulting. For the other 12 fanbases in the conference, \"fight, boys\" is more or less true. Northwestern might go 3-9 this year but last year they were in the Big Ten Championship Game. Even schools like Indiana have climbed to a \"at least competing for a bowl game\" rung on the ladder. Everybody fights. For us (and for Rutgers), we increasingly have zero chance on Saturdays.\n\nWhich means that when BTN blasts out \"heyyy Illini fans we're coming to your city!\", I want absolutely nothing to do with it. I'll likely time my drive on Saturday so that there's zero chance I'm anywhere near this BTN Tailgate thing. I'm sick to my stomach just thinking about it. My overwhelming emotion is \"please, for your sake, keep your cameras away from us\".\n\nLike, they're going to ask a bunch of Illini fans to stand in the background and hold up signs and wave orange and blue flags (or whatever). Do they not understand how hard this is? We have three (THREE) seasons above .500 in the conference since I arrived on campus in the fall of 1991 (and the one where you're saying \"what was the third?\" was 1993 where we went 0-3 in the non-conference and missed a bowl at 5-6). We've been beaten down for nearly three decades now, and you want to prop us up in the background and act like we're Wisconsin fans or something? \"Stand there and cheer and hold some signs - it looks good for our show\".\n\nI need you to know something about those of us who still show up every Saturday (and there aren't many of us left). We do it out of loyalty to our school and to our players. The administration has made nearly 30 consecutive years of bad decisions and left us without a program to support. But we do it anyway, because they can't make us quit. We have vowed to be there when the corner is turned, so we're going to keep showing up and keep showing up.\n\nBut when you shove a camera in our face and ask us to act like we're enjoying this, it's hard, man. Yes, this is homecoming, but please realize that, at least for me, this is the most difficult build-up to homecoming in any of those 28 years I mentioned above. 31-point underdogs on homecoming. It's so hard to drag ourselves to Champaign for that. The smiles are only going to be quarter-hearted.\n\nLook, I know that it's not possible to cancel Homecoming nor is it possible to cancel a BTN Tailgate asking Illini fans to dance in the background and pretend like everything is OK for two hours. I'm just saying I want everyone to understand where we're at: leave Britney alone.\n\nHere, I'll give you some perspective, since this has apparently become an \"open letter to BTN and other Big Ten fanbases peering in on Illinois football\". Attendance on Saturday was 37,275. For Michigan. Thus far, the average attendance this season is exactly 36,800 through four games. Here's some perspective on that.\n\nThe 2017 season dipped below the 1998 low water mark (1998 average attendance: 39,590; 2017: 39,429) to be the lowest average (paid) attendance since 1970 (37,659). Then, last season beat that number (36,151), meaning it was the lowest attendance since 1962 (35,295). If this year dips below that (and it's quite possible, with Rutgers and Northwestern still on the schedule in November - the last Saturday-after-Thanksgiving Northwestern game in 2017 drew 30,456 paid, so this one will almost certainly be less), then this season will be the lowest attendance in Champaign since World War II.\n\nI need to put that in one paragraph for emphasis. The post-war low mark is 1962 when the average attendance was 35,295. That's one year after the winless season (1961) that Dick Butkus was talking about on stage last Friday. Right now the average attendance is 36,800, and that average will get a boost from a homecoming crowd on Saturday but a dip from both Rutgers and Northwestern, and if it dips below 35,295, it will be the lowest since 1945. And the 1945 attendance was war-related. 1946 saw an average attendance of 59,437, but the year before, in 1945, it was 24,011. So \"since the war\" will be accurate.\n\nSince the war.\n\nThat is the fanbase you're encountering when you pull up to Champaign on Saturday. We're beaten and bludgeoned, man. Those of us who still drag ourselves to Champaign for seven Saturdays every fall completely understand why the other tens of thousands decided to quit. \"Diehard\" means exactly what it says, and this been hard enough that even diehards died.\n\nSo just know that you're filming a funeral, not Mardis Gras. Sure, it's an Irish funeral (heh), and the tailgating is great with so many grass fields immediately around the stadium (and so few people, meaning we can spread out and really flex our tailgating muscles), but this is not Iowa or Penn State (or even Minnesota or Purdue). This is a group of people who watch football games through their middle and ring fingers while covering their eyes.\n\nI can't speak for all of us, but for me, I mostly want to be left alone with my grief. I'm a St. Louis guy, so I want to see the Cards win, but I could barely handle the last week. The Cardinals are in their 10th (tenth!) NLCS since 2000 and the fanbase is in an uproar. I get that fans are going to be fans and getting swept without ever having the lead in any game is bad, so I understand the immediate anger, but it's so hard for me to see a fanbase complain that much (especially before the series). I would give anything - seriously anything - for a 6-6 season and an insignificant bowl. And here's a fanbase angry during their 10th Final Four in the last 20 seasons. I just can't be around it.\n\nI'd imagine, say, a Reds fans would feel the same way. The Cards have won 18 playoff series since 1996; the Reds haven't won a single playoff series since 1990. This win over the Braves last week where the Cards scored 10 in the first inning to take the NLDS? That would have been the single greatest Reds game in 30 years. Yet there was still so much angst among Cardinals fans.\n\nAgain, I get the immediate fan reaction. If it's Nats/Astros in the World Series and the Astros win, Nats fans will be angry immediately afterwards and then look back in a few months and say \"greatest season of my lifetime\". Everyone wants to win it all, and the losses hurt immediately, but with time, there are levels below \"win it all\" which are satisfying.\n\nFor me, I just want a few years at the absolute lowest level of \"success\". I'm a fan of the sport that gives out more participation trophies than any other sport (I believe the bowl game total moves to 41 this year, which means that 82 out of 130 teams get to go), and we haven't been since 2014. I don't even want that filet - someone, anyone, just give me some porridge. I'll love it I swear.\n\nThat's the fanbase you're peering in on this Saturday, BTN. We're as defeated as any fanbase you've ever seen. According to this email here, you're setting up a \"sign making station\" where fans are encouraged to create signs which can be held up in the background.\n\nI'm not sure \"I AM DEAD INSIDE\" is going to make for great television."}, {"comment_id": "f4biajv", "post_id": "dk8cyq", "comment": "Illinois football teams and ruining my weekend.

I posted that in dismay as I saw the final scenes of OU losing. I'm very heart broken by this game because I feel like *we had it won!* Kudos to Smart for bringing pressure early on in the 3rd, essentially telling Riley \"if you try to get comfortable with these offense plays, we'll fuck you up\". And after that big sack, Baker didn't seem the same as well. But Riley's youth and inexperience really showed after halftime. He started to get cute with his playcalls, and that's a big no no against a top 5 defense. Had Riley played a bit more traditionally, we'd have the W in regulation.  \n  \nThis loss stings even more because Baker Mayfield is the greatest OU football player ever. There I said it. And it's gonna be tough to cock back and fire again the way we did this year.   \n  \nNevertheless, this was an *amazing* game to watch as a football fan. I think we'll be talking about this game for years to come. And hey, at least we were able to prove that our defense isn't *as* bad as people made it out to be.  \n  \nBut it has to be better if we wanna win a natty again. Mike Stoops won't be fired, but he should be. I hope that some school picks him up, but I doubt that'll happen. I hope that Riley at least promotes McNiel or someone else to co-DC, and lets him call the plays.  \n  \nTim Kish needs to go. Like right fucking now.  \n  \nBut I wrote this comment giving props to the Dawgs and I'll end it with that. A ton of teams can be considered \"good\". They can be athletic, talented, hard-willed, and fast. But what makes UGA different is Kirby Smart's ability to adjust. It's like he fielded an entirely new team that second half. It seems like Bama will beat Clemson, and I think that this ability by Smart will be their xfactor to winning the chip. Go get em Dawgs, you guys really earned it.  \n  \nOnto 2018-19 Sooners."}, {"comment_id": "ds28thw", "post_id": "7njfyo", "comment": "And now Georgia has home field advantage for a championship game.

I'll tell you a motherfucking NCAA story.\n\nHere I am, 4 years later, and NCAA 14 is still one of my favorite video games. The most fun I have had is with Road to Glory.\nYears ago I had this idea to create a player, but I didn't simply create a version of myself, oh no. Instead, I decided to create a new character with a complete backstory created in my brain.\nThis character? QB #1 Axel Haze.\n\n\nAxel Haze grew up in the middle of nowhere in Texas. With a demeanor and attitude not unlike Matthew McConaughey (actually, just fucking picture a young Matthew McConaughey), this young man was destined for football greatness. He was the ultimate duel-threat QB. First choice? The bastard would run the option unlike anybody else. Faster'n all hell and tougher than nails, Axel Haze may have been the first QB to wear a bullbar RB facemask. He'd juke you, hurdle you, and, if you were in his way, truck your ass. However, he wasn't just a running QB. The bastard had a cannon so fucking gnarly he could just chuck a pigskin a quarter-mile.\nAfter leading his team to a state championship in a 70-0 blowout, every single D-1 team had his number. Where would he go? Bama? Ohio State? Texas? A&M? Oh no.\n\n\nAxel Haze chose Air Force.\n\n\nAxel Haze grew up in a working-class family. He spent his youth working with his father tending to the Texan crops. He harvested, planted, but more than anything? Axel loved flying the crop dusters. Despite never having obtained a pilot's license, Axel began flying these simple planes at age 10. Work was hard, and his studies always game first (no surprise, then, that he scored the highest SAT scores in Texas history), but Axel never felt quite as free as he did when he flew. So, with the pick of the litter Axel chose Air Force.\nMuch like the tumultuous skies to which Axel was so drawn, his initial time at Air Force was a bumpy ride. Though a model student in the classroom, Axel Haze's superiors found it difficult to wrangle the young man, both on the field and in the skies. Improvisation and disregard for procedure was the complaint of both his coaches and his superiors. On the field, Axel was unpredictable, calling audibles to his liking, and sometimes even calling long pass plays with the sole intent of scrambling immediately. In the air, Axel's unpredictability was matched only by his recklessness. His complete disregard for standard operating procedure made him dangerous.\n\n\n\"Dammit, Haze!\" a caption once told him. \"This isn't a fucking crop duster in bumfuck Texas! This is the United States Air Force! There are rules! Procedure!\"\n\n\nAxel, remaining calm, simply replied, \"With all respect, sir, I've been flyin' my whole life. Flyin' a bird, to me, is like being with a woman. You give me enough time, and a little creativity, and I'll make her purr. Alright alright alright.\"\n\n\n\nAs time went on, Axel Haze's superiors had no choice but to let the man do things his way. He quickly became not only the finest Airman in the Acadamy, but the most prolific QB in both school and NCAA history. He shattered records across the board, became the first 3-time Heisman Trophy winner, and brought 2 National Championships to the Air Force Academy. Upon graduation, Haze didn't even consider playing for the NFL.\n\n\n\n\"I figure I came here to serve, and by God that's what I plan on doing. My time in the 'Force was the best goddamn time of my life, and I thank God for the opportunity. But now? I reckon I have a chore or two to do for Uncle Sam. After that? Hell. If that big hoss from the Steelers can play after serving, I reckon maybe I can too. Alright alright alright.\"\n\nSo... that's my NCAA 14 story.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dpstil1", "post_id": "7cv0ga", "comment": "We should be getting the opportunity to be getting pissed off at them, too!

I have no doubt in my mind that some of the injuries on D for LSU were real. I see that 3 guys are out for their next game. I recall when Texas played Cal, Goff freaked out when one of our players went down because it looked like he flopped. Well he did flop because he tried to stay on the field then realized he was hurt, and missed the next 6-8 weeks with a shoulder injury. \n\n2. I also have no doubt that some were fake to stop the clock/slow down our O. Several times, guys would walk off, and then immediately run back on the next play without getting IV/taking a break/whatever. Supposedly Chaisson winked at our sideline after going down according to the Thamel article, who knows if thats real, I'd probably lean towards not. I was at the game and there were several LSU fans in my section that thought some guys dropping was BS. It's not like LSU would be the first team to do it.\n\n3. All that being said, you should never boo an injured player whether they could be faking it or not. I held the Horns up every time until they were helped off the field. I won't excuse people who booed.\n\n4. I have a hard time buying the AC deal. If true, its bullshit and we should be ashamed. But La Tech didn't say anything about it publicly, and not a single LSU player/coach says anything until today's PC?  I don't buy it. Read another poster claims someone from Texas Athletics on Austin radio claimed the AC is fully functional and we provided an extra generator for their sideline, but I'd like to hear this from Del Conte or someone officially."}, {"comment_id": "ezrh0f5", "post_id": "d1uwvr", "comment": "I am calling BS."}, {"comment_id": "ezqflqw", "post_id": "d1uwvr", "comment": "Is there no A/C system installed in the visitor's locker room?

Orgeron did not \"confirm\" that the A/C didn't work for LSU. Read the quote in the article: \"So we did some things in the dressing room that were better. It wasn't great, but it was better. At least we had air in there. [Louisiana Tech] didn't have air. We had some blowers in there. I don't think that caused as much as going out there and having to play 93 plays on defense. I think that had a lot to do with it.\" Honestly, his wording is pretty vague, so I'm not ready to pass judgement yet.\n\n2. Louisiana Tech said the A/C wasn't working for their game. After years of this never being an issue at DKR--even in some really big games--do people really think we're going to start intentionally pulling that level of bullshit against Louisiana Fucking Tech of all schools?\n\n3. Regarding people bitching about the placement of the band: that's where the visiting band sat when I was a student there 10 years ago. Also, that was negotiated between the two schools prior to the event, in order to increase revenue from those tickets. I would imagine UT's band will probably be in a similar spot at LSU next year.\n\n4. Regarding people bitching about how Texas only allotted LSU 3,000 tickets: LSU agreed to that, and that is exactly how many tickets LSU is allotting Texas for the game in Baton Rouge next year.\n\n**Now, with all that being said:** IF Texas intentionally didn't provide A/C for the game, then that's abhorrent and heads need to roll."}, {"comment_id": "ezqrdm8", "post_id": "d1uwvr", "comment": "Call me skeptical but this is the kind of thing that, if true, would have been made known immediately and very publicly.

I think the fans were skeptical of some injuries that were actual injuries. But after seeing the \"cramping\" issues repeatedly, I don't blame them. \n\nHowever, the allegation alone is enough to warrant an investigation into it and IF true, it is complete chicken sh\\*t by the UT Athletic Department and someone, if not multiple people, should be fired over it. \n\nI'd be curious if someone asks Skip Holtz if he called Ed O (or anyone on his staff) to warn him."}, {"comment_id": "ezq326j", "post_id": "d1uwvr", "comment": "If ASU did this the entire visiting team would melt during half time"}, {"comment_id": "ezqp38s", "post_id": "d1uwvr", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ezq7hjs", "post_id": "d1uwvr", "comment": "Bush league from Texas.

Maybe they just like football a lot and don't want to find a new team to root for.\n\n2. An even bigger group of ex-fans still watch because of a combination of habit, nostalgia, the satisfaction of watching something you hate, or liking a few older players. Philip Rivers is still playing at a high level and while he may not be as beloved in San Diego as LT is, he gave it his all for over a decade and really embraced San Diego as his home. It's hard to completely turn your back on guys like Rivers and Antonio Gates when the shitty ownership decisions have nothing to do with them. Most of my family falls into this group, having been Chargers fans since they moved from LA to SD over 50 years ago.\n\n3. And then there are those ex-fans that basically hate the Chargers and have either moved on to a new NFL team to root for, have focused more on CFB (the SDSU football team has regained some prominence recently), or are done with the sport in general. \n\nHowever, even if a new owner could wrangle all these groups back together, an NFL franchise in San Diego will probably always have below average attendance compared to the rest of the league, because the rest of the county offers too many fun things to do at a much smaller pricetag.

I'm already off work, she's at work so I'm home alone watching the game. There are boxes everywhere. \n\nOnce I realize the game is going to OT, I say fuck it, get up and go pee, then start making a sandwich. I'm watching the kick from underneath the cabinet above the bar in the kitchen, but I wasn't really concerned about it because come on, it's an Alabama kicker. I saw the kick was clearly way short.\n\nI shrugged and started spreading mayonnaise. \"Chris Davis fields it in the end zone.\" I look up and see the play moving to Davis' left and just kind of assume he'll be forced out of bounds. \n\n\"He's to the 30...35...40...45...50!!! 45!!!\"\n\n\"Wha...???\"\n\nI look up and see no one between Davis and the end zone. It finally breaks through in my mind what is happening. \n\nMy butter knife clatters to the floor, sending mayo flying. I sprint into the living room, obliterate a toe on a box, and go flying to the ground in front of the TV. Not to be deterred, I mat kick off the floor. \n\n\"YES!!! GO DAVIS GO!!! GO BABY YEAHHHHHH!!!\"\n\nI don't even really hate Bama like the rest of you. But on that day, I felt the hate.

They had to hold nearly every play to keep the defense back. Not to mention their run game was non existent because of this.    \nEvery pass for Texas also felt like a home run attempt throughout the game. Sure they had some nice short passes, but it felt like every time a play had a deep route the ball went deep. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nTheir defense was asssss. Coverage sucked, tackling sucked, struggled to move the offensive line, and committed penalty after penalty.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nHave fun with Tim Beck. His play calling showed. Find success in one place, don't go to it again. Have a lot of short routes that go no where. Pass, pass, pass, qb run, pass. Easily recognizable 4th down plays.    \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI would not go to Texas if I was a coach or recruit. The expectations ruin everything. Come off a 5-7 year and haven't  had a 8 win season in 5 years. They expect you to win the b12. Lose a dissapointng one to a smaller meh team. Fans play the field with trash and boo. Any rebuild would be derailed by this. College players are moody guys. Your own fans don't support you will get you down. Make you want to quit. Not meeting the high expectations are a failure. Texas casual fans are toxic and will keep Texas from succeeding.

This allows the thread to be seen (in contrast to removing it entirely), and is not an ideal solution, but is largely a stopgap measure to rule breaking comments surfacing faster than our volunteer team can moderate. Two rules in particular tend to get broken a lot in Baylor threads (see **/r/CFB/w/rules**):\n\n**Rule 2: No flamebait, personal attacks, or harassment**\n\n>-- Flamebait is any post that is designed to get negative reactions from a particular user or fanbase. You might also call this \"trolling\".\n\n>-- Personal attacks - If you're having to resort to calling someone names, you're doing it wrong. (Yes, this includes things like calling people idiots, questioning their intelligence, etc.)\n\n>-- Harassment can take many forms, from post-stalking to unwanted private messages; it will also result in a very quick ban (and you may get reported to the admins for good measure).\n\n>-- Friendly ribbing and trash talk is part of sports fandom, and is fine. This can be a narrow line sometimes, so if you're not sure, tread carefully.\n\n**Rule 3: No racism, homophobia, sexism, rape jokes, or other bigotry**\n\n>-- We want /r/CFB to be a friendly place for everyone. Even if you're joking, you never know when someone might misunderstand. This also applies to overly sexually- or racially-charged comments that may make groups of people feel uncomfortable or unwelcome. It also applies to jokes about sexual assault and rape, as well as mental and developmental disorders.\n\n**You can communicate any opinion you like, but you do have to do it in a respectful way that abides by the rules of our community.** We recognize that locking a thread is far from an ideal solution, but it can often be the least bad solution available.\n\n### Things You can Specifically Do to Help\n\nIf you read nothing else, please read this:\n\n* **Read /r/CFB/w/rules** thoroughly and make yourself familiar with our rules.\n* **Click Report** under comments and posts that violate our rules to help us moderate more efficiently.\n* **Encourage people** to respect the rules and upvote insightful commentary.\n\nThis is a story that needs to be told, and unfortunately this forum was not an effective place to have that discussion past the first ~270 comments.

Other than the obvious QB passing disparity without Milton, they really suffered from some poor plays in every facet of the game. The offensive line was consistently giving up pressure to four man rushes all game; the WRs had critical, critical drops on good throws; 10+ penalties on both offense and defense, often on critical downs; the defensive line failed to get pressure on Burrow without blitzing; the secondary missed tackles all game; LSU absolutely dominated time of possession AND offensive yards (seriously, LSU more than doubled UCF\u2019s time of possession, with over 40 min of ToP of the 60 in game minutes, AND nearly doubled their first downs).\n\nObviously a lot of that comes back around on the UCF offense for failing to sustain drives...but LSU dominated every facet of this game and their gameplan worked to perfection.

Depression is so drastically different from one person to the next, and I wish people understood that. One might be from sadness/loneliness, one might not have any motivation to live, one might be looking at their life and seeing no future, one might question what's the purpose of life, one might hate society, etc. I still laugh and smile plenty and am always polite. It doesn't mean the darkness isn't still there. Same with my wife. We joke on that's why we found each other and belong together. \n\nRIP Tyler.

Many of them were probably looking forward to seeing each other, since their Thanksgiving break was cut short due to the game. There are traditions between some sections in the two bands that had been going for decades when I was there. I'm sure they still exist. \n\nBut instead they heard of a horrible accident, didn't know if their friends were okay and then came out and learned a new tune the day of the game, a busy day for a normal game but even more so for Apple Cup. \n\nThe CMB deserves every ounce of credit they are getting, but I want people to know it was more than just playing a rivals fight song.
