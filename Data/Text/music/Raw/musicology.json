You can actually just google it and \"Krell Music\" and get a good idea of what a husband and wife team of composers thought music of an alien culture would sound like.\n\nI think most of your \"fantasy\" genre stuff tends to be connected pretty well with our history, and as such a lot of times the music will just sound like \"Early Music\" - Renaissance music, Troubadours and things like that.\n\nI think music-makers are within their rights to assume that any culture that evolves similarly to us (since usually in movies the characters have to be played by actors, at least pre-CGI days) will also evolve instruments similar to us.\n\nThough it may certainly be a little \"western centric\" to assume that they'd develop music less like Africa or Asia, and more like Europe. But since they usually model clothing and everything else again it seems like the logical course.\n\nIt also makes it easier to compose because you don't have to be historically accurate ;-)\n\nI've always found the few examples in the Star Trek universe interesting - Spock's lyre-like instrument - in some of the newer things Klingons sing/chant, and there are references to the music of other species - Klingon Opera I think is mentioned. In Voyager, the Doctor becomes a virtuoso singer for a culture. In a DS9 episode they had a player who played an instrument kind of like what we'd consider Clarinet-like.\n\nBut, Strings, Drums, Pipes, and Metal/Wood - what do we have, Chordophones, Membranophones, Ideophones, Aerophones...am I forgetting one...? Anyway, those sort of basic \"sound making\" physical objects would be likely in any culture.\n\nBut it would be intereting to see how far away you could get from tradition. Wouldn't it be cool for a culture to have a plant with a seed pod that when blown into, produces a note and rattles the seeds at the same time!\n\nOf course I suppose it also depends on how advanced your culture is.\n\nIt would be even more fun to do like alien cultures where they have 3 legs so their \"marches\" are in 3/4 and their dances are in 3! or something."}, {"comment_id": "e2dnep2", "post_id": "8yqdbw", "comment": "The local arts group broadcast an abridged reading of A Wizard of Earthsea and asked me to create some background music for it.\n\nTo a certain extent, I had to do what I was told, but they didn't give me a lot of instructions: they wanted something similar to the Enya songs in LOTR and that there's an overarching concept of light/dark balance, so the music had to portray that somehow.\n\nThe attemps to clone Enya were deleted.\n\nFor the \"balance\" concept, I made rhythms in 7/4. A common thing I noticed in progressive rock music in 7/4 is that if you divide the measure in half, you get two 3.5 beat measures so you have something that sounds syncopated but is balanced at the same time.

There are two sets of opposite tendencies that act on that particular musical style, and when that style is in the middle, it arrives at the top.\n\nThe first set is one of chaos versus order applied to sociology, so marginalised groups and central institutions. The second set is one of complexity versus simplicity, again applied to sociology, which means music specialists versus the masses.\n\nEach type of the eight types of music shown in the graph has its explanation and a few examples.\n\n[The full post detailing each explanation can be found here] (https://yohaciendomeelculto.wordpress.com/2016/12/02/social-hegemony-of-musical-styles/)\n\nThis is the explanation for Industrial Music:\nIndustrial music, on the other hand, is comprised of a set of musical styles that don\u2019t have a social base naturally attached to it. It can acquire it with time, though. It\u2019s comprised by forms of music that are created mainly for the purpose of making money, or providing a service. Musical scores for movies or video games are the main examples. Music for television shows, announcements, or trailers. Sometimes, if the institutions and atmospheres that comprise this way of music making are sane and powerful enough, they can attract individuals from the creator minority that produce music of great quality able to connect to a wide audience. Examples of this kind of phenomenon are great and famous film composers like Hans Zimmer or John Williams, whose compositions are able to transcend their primary capitalist functions and become cultural icons, like the Star Wars themes, between many other movies. Another example is the style of what was known firstly as \u2018industrial\u2019 music per se, and now called popularly \u2018epic\u2019 music, which is a style that existed in the shadows for a long time, comprised of production tracks and sounds sold to movie trailers and TV series. They took classical music harmony and orchestral wisdom and applied it very successfully with modern techniques, creating a very advanced and genius style of music, which caught on with lots of music-loving people outside the entertainment industry.

I then generated wordlists out of these themes, as indicators for a certain ideology in a song. In the second part, I analysed the database above using a script for the occurence of these words, weighted them accordingly and used this data as a means to make assumptions about the quantity of these ideologies in the genre of black metal. \n\nThe results were that folklorism and cultutal pessimism were the topics that occured the most, followed by satanism and then national socialism.

Composers like Schutz recognized the need for a firm grounding in counterpoint, even if one's compositional efforts were more homophonic.

So I think that anyone who was a contemporary of Wagner or who came later could hear movie themes and feel fairly comfortable with the musical language. \n\nHowever, 18th century musicians would have had a much different idea of what a melodic line should do, how it should be harmonized, and what instrumentation would work well with it. As an example, let's think about the [\"Force Theme\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gpXMGit4P8) from Star Wars. Now there's a lot about the melodic line that would work in an eighteenth century context, but a lot would need to change about how the line is treated to bring it in line with eighteenth century aesthetics. \n\nTo illustrate what I mean, I have turned the basic melodic line of the force theme into an idiomatic eighteenth century \"ritornello\" (which is the music that an orchestra would play before a singer's entrance in an aria).\n\n[[midi mockup](https://soundcloud.com/nmitchell076/force-theme-ritornello) | [score](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9wYtm5NwTTVc3FoX0pRV1kyejA/view?usp=sharing)]\n\nThe first 7 seconds I pulled from the first 7 seconds of the force theme, though I alter the melodic figuration, give a full orchestral harmonization rather than the \"eerie strings\" of the recording, and repeat the last bit.\n\nThe next bit (from :7-12) is wholly my own. I just couldn't find a way to work the stuff from :7-:12 of the actual force theme into something that sounded convincing and stylistic.  An eighteenth century musician would have most likely moved onto a new idea here, whereas Williams lingers on the first idea a bit more. So I decided to try to stick with the eighteenth century mindset and do something new.\n\nThe rest of it is all Williams' melody, which I harmonized and repeated in certain ways that makes more sense to the eighteenth century.\n\nHopefully that example gives you a good sense of where eighteenth and 20th century \"thinking\" in music is similar and where it is different."}, {"comment_id": "d2q7aeb", "post_id": "4hjhcb", "comment": "> So I think that anyone who was a contemporary of Wagner or who came later could hear movie many themes and feel fairly comfortable with the musical language.\n\nSince you were specific about harmony later in your post, I think it's appropriate to point out that there is a huge difference between how Wagner tended to harmonize and how it works in most Hollywood (especially more recently). His technique of extending dominants with (half) diminished chords and moving rapidly between keys via voice leading contained in these unstable chords is very rare in contemporary film music, which tends to have little to no dominant function at all, be more modal, not have diminished chords in general, modulate directly etc.  And Wagner's motifs tend not to be the full blown melodies common to Hollywood \"themes\". While it might be easier to make the comparison to some iconic scores like Star Wars (here's the leitmotif for X, here's loud brass, etc), I think on the whole the connection between Wagner and Hollywood is overstated and the differences understated.  \n\nOr at least, the comparison worked much much better a few decades ago and even further back.\n\nSorry if that was a little off topic, but hey I'm really into these things."}, {"comment_id": "d2qlx0a", "post_id": "4hjhcb", "comment": "Wow, brovo.

So the musical language was developed about 150 years after the period you're talking about.\n\nJust one example of Star Wars differing from Mozart: listen to the part of the main theme called the \"Rebel Fanfare\" (the blaring trumpets part)--the harmonization here is what is known as \"parallel major triads\"--this type of harmony would've been considered totally incorrect by Mozart and his contemporaries."}, {"comment_id": "d2qs6eb", "post_id": "4hjhcb", "comment": "I've used him cause he's the oldest composer I remember having orchestra with orchestra that *sounds* like a modern orchestra, same instruments and tempo. Even with a basic knowledge I can see that modern soundtracks are more similar to Wagner or maybe Dvorak. Naturally I understand you can sometimes hear folk music dating thousands of years back in modern music, I'm interested in, so to say, possible scientific classification of modern orchestra music and classic one."}, {"comment_id": "cftrkxm", "post_id": "1zhq1x", "comment": "That's my professor or was.
