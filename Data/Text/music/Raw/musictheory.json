This is directed at the new person (\"\"I see you driving 'round town with the girl I love.\"). So, we've established that his ex is a girl, but's not clear at this point if that someone is male or female.\n\nNext up is the first verse. He's changed focus now (mostly), as the other person, now clearly male (refered to as \"he\"), is discussed in the third person.  (\"He's an Xbox, I'm more like Atari\").  The background singers do direct their lines at new guy though \"Oh shit she's a golddigger, just thought you should know...\".\n\nAnd so the song repeats.\n\nSorry man, I don't think there's any hidden meaning here.

Then you get to the involved part- In my experience, since you're not going back to any Low-UR notes after the Eb its possible to go 1234 and halfhole the 5 with the bottom halfholed. After that it's a question of un-holing each subsequent UR note until you get to just 13 for high Bb. \n\nI'm assuming you're playing recorder because that's the only REAL instrument besides triangle and you can't do scales on a triangle.\n\nGood day and good luck!"}, {"comment_id": "dpdbmy8", "post_id": "7aus4m", "comment": "Well, you have to start by getting a Bb harmonica, and then just play a major scale, and use your fingers to hold it."}, {"comment_id": "dpdmgk5", "post_id": "7aus4m", "comment": "The best fingering for playing a Bb major scale is to use no fingers.

Beethoven didn't learn music theory without ear training.  *Nobody* does, except perhaps some self-taught dabblers who learn teach themselves from books without listening to examples and internalizing them.   Music theory is a *language*, and as you learn new musical vocabulary, you learn to read it, write it, hear/recognize it, play it, and sing it.  At least when you learn it in a formal setting, as Beethoven did.  \n\nSure, there are plenty of incredibly brilliant musicians who learn entirely by ear and never learn to read/write.

I have incredible respect for these types of musicians, but they don't really contradict the OP's point, because Beethoven *was* formally trained and *could* read/write music.  And while I deeply respect gifted \"by-ear-only\" musicians, I think going deaf would present them a significant compositional hurdle--they would struggle to communicate their inner-ear ideas to other musicians.

Maybe--since there was no hate for you--there will be hate for me instead!\n\n Music theory, some people in this threat are saying, is descriptive and not prescriptive. That is supposed to mean something like: music theory describes how music works but it is not supposed to tell us how music *should* or *must* be.\n\nHowever, music theory does not merely describe music. It describes *good* music--or, at least, musical features that are in some way aesthetically valuable. \n\nThat means  it also prescribes:    if you want to make good music, do such-and-such and avoid such-and-such.\n\nWe don't craft music theory around mediocre or bad music--we don't seek to theorize the harmonic structure of that stuff. (Or if we do it's only to understand what to avoid.) The whole point of music theory is to explain what is good in music.\n\nThis makes me a traditionalist, I know. Much of the history of music theory is an attempt to explain what makes amazing music amazing. Why is J.S. Bach's work so good? How can we tell whether this is Bach or some amateurish rip off? \n\n\nSome people are saying that there will be exceptions to theories that we develop, and that if this happens then we should go with our gut and reject the theory. I agree with all of that--all of that just proves that we haven't  discovered the correct theory yet. It doesn't prove that there's no such thing as \"correct\" music anymore than disproving a theory in physics proves that there's no such thing as \"correct\" physics.\n\nI'm not saying that composers should consciously try to follow music theory. That would be a huge mistake for many reasons. For one thing, contemporary music theory is probably wrong. We haven't figured out how good music works yet or even what good music is. So music based on contemporary theory will suck. (Hindemith anyone?) Second, even if we did have a true theory of good music, it would be really distracting to write music based on it--kind of like how it's really distracting for athletes to think consciously about which muscles they should flex while they're trying to play. Third, it's not necessary to know a theory in order to do what the theory says to do. I don't know anything about linguistics or the physiology of how the brain produces sentences that come out of my keyboard--but I don't *need* to know that stuff in order to write sentences on reddit.\n\nFinally, some people say that theory can't be like a \"law\" because music is about feelings, and if you like how something sounds/feels then you should just go with it. But there can be a law of feelings--that is, there can be a theory that is based on how our feelings work. That, in my opinion, is what the true music theory will tell us: the laws of how sound reliably produces feelings. \n\nOnce we develop these laws, we'll be able (in theory) to make a computer algorithm that makes perfect music.

At the same time I think it would possible to get your point across more effectively, so here are a couple aspects I think you could improve on for future videos.\n\nYour core thesis is a good one. I think it would help if you took all your biggest points and summarized them in one explicit thesis statement. You could start by playing Shapiro's statement and then saying something like:\n\n*There are lots of issues with Ben Shapiro's statement. A) Ben Shapiro's definition of music was pulled out of his ass and has no basis in reality; B) even so, actually hip hop does satisfy Ben Shapiro's definition of music; C) Ben Shapiro is not a trustworthy source of information, particularly in this case since he has made no attempt to understand the subject matter. Now let's break these  points down one by one.*\n\nI think you could make your point more forcefully if you tightened your script so that you could get your point across faster. There were a few times where you went off on tangents, it would help if you kept the tangents short and tight. For example, you dedicated a big chunk of time to showing a clip of foli and saying \"look here's a genre of music with no melody or harmony\" (btw I had never heard of foli before so thank you for putting me on). Whereas with the same amount of video time, you could have played, say, foli, kumi-daiko, and Detroit techno for a few seconds each, and then say \"look, here are three vastly different genres from three vastly different cultures, none of them have melody or harmony, but all of them have their own musical tradition and composition rules\". \n\nOne thing I liked was the part about T.I., because you showed that his position is inconsistent with itself. This is a strong debate strategy when it works and I think it would be helpful to deploy it more often. There's another big opportunity to make a similar argument. At three different parts of the video, you point out (a) Shapiro said one of his favorite musical genres is jazz, (b) Shapiro also said the value of music is tied to how much time goes into creating it, and (c) all the complaints Shapiro makes about hip hop echo the things past conservative critics said about jazz. All the points you made here are good in their own but they are even stronger if you tie them together. Put (a) and (b) together to say, *how can someone call themselves a fan of improvised music and also say improvisation isn't music? The only possible answer is that he's applying a double standard.* Just like the T.I. thing, he's twisted himself into a logical contradiction trying to invalidate hip hop. Then adding (c) leads straight to my favorite argument you made, when you said (paraphrasing): *the reason this guy doesn't see a contradiction is because he is arguing from the conservative cultural space; the real reason he's going after hip hop is because he is a tool of the capitalist status quo and he has a vested interest in discrediting the voices of oppressed communities; and the crap he's saying about hip hop is exactly what people like him were saying about jazz before it got gentrified.*\n\nI'm going to stop now because I'm spiraled out of control and written way more than I meant to. One final note, I think it would engage the listener more if you could pick up the energy level of your voice. Talking faster, and exaggerating the pitch variations in your voice as you speak, will get you most of the way there. This is something that that 12tone video did well, compare your narration to their narration to see the difference. \n\n**TL;DR: It would improve the video if you restructured the argument to get to the point faster.**\n\nApologies if I went overboard with the criticism here, I hope this doesn't overshadow the fact that you made a lot of good points and I like what you had to say."}, {"comment_id": "f53ius6", "post_id": "dmjrtq", "comment": "How do you arrive at the conclusion that film scores don't have rhythm?"}, {"comment_id": "f53yr7w", "post_id": "dmjrtq", "comment": "Don\u2019t feed trolls"}, {"comment_id": "f545ua6", "post_id": "dmjrtq", "comment": "I ain't taking nothing he says seriously"}, {"comment_id": "f51w3lk", "post_id": "dmjrtq", "comment": "Shapiro's points were dumb.

A large portion of the video isn't even about music (which is why I don't think it belongs in this subreddit), it's about dropping as many buzzwords as possible. Alt-right? Really? MLK would be against a border wall? Guess you haven't bothered to pay attention to Obama calling for increased border protection... Inciting gun violence? Did you know that his news site is one of the few that omits mass shooters' names and pictures due to a link between the infamy it leads to and rising mass shootings?\n\nYou make a lot of big assumptions on his motives. I don't agree with everything Shapiro says, but I also don't think he's a racist bigot. But, assuming he were 100% racist, to assume that his reason for saying that rap isn't music is racist, ignoring his given reasons, is still a pretty big assumption. Racist people can do things for non-racist reasons. It's logically inconsistent to say that he doesn't think rap is music because it's made by black people, but then to ignore the fact that he obviously considers jazz music. IMO, if anything, this speaks more to classical music elitism rather than anything else.\n\nI don't have time to go into all that's wrong with this video, but it lacks any intellectual honesty for me to take seriously.

My point being that if we are setting the bar at music that changes the world and the history of music, then, no, rap is not that movement. We might remember Tupacs name in 100 years but I'd be surprised if we are still playing his music and selling his records at the pace which Mozart performances are sold. I agree rap is music. I also agree it's on a lower level of artistic expression. But the great thing about music is it doesn't matter what I think.

Great work OP! As a music theory 'cheat sheet' this works really well, but if this is all really new to you then it definitely requires a bit of annotation.\n\nThe rows running across the top explain [scale degrees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degree_(music\\)). Basically this is how we refer to each note in the 12-note [chromatic scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_scale). This is the core of the vast majority of the rest of the stuff on this page, so it's really important to understand these. So as an example, if C is your tonic, then C#/Db is your minor 2nd, D your major 2nd, Eb/D# your minor third, E your major third, etc. You can then apply this to any key (e.g. if G is your tonic, then G#/Ab is your minor 2nd, A your major 2nd, Bb/A# your minor 3rd, B your major third, etc.). It's important in music theory to use relative terms like this, rather than use absolute note pitches. Relative terms can be applied to any key, so it's much more flexible to think that way rather than pigeonholing yourself to a single key.\n\nEach degree of the scale can also be referred to by its [harmonic function](http://sites.fas.harvard.edu/~earlab/tutorial/tut6.html), which are listed directly below that on the middle of the page. In musical shorthand, a capital Roman numeral denotes a major chord, and a lowercase Roman numeral denotes a minor chord. Note that this only shows the functions for a major key, [the functions in minor keys](http://www.teoria.com/en/tutorials/functions/intro/08-minor-keys.php) are named the same but follow a different pattern of which degrees are major/minor.\n\nTo the left are the [different kinds of scales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scale_(music\\)). The numbers used here relate to the scale degrees bit at the top of the page. \"w\" refers to a whole step (e.g. moving from a C up to a D), and \"h\" refers to a half step (e.g. moving from a C up to a C#). A particular scale will always follow the same pattern of 'steps' - that is what makes it a scale, not the notes but the relative distance between each note.\n\nBelow that is a list of [modes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mode_(music\\)). Modes are most easily visualised as a scale on a piano from a note to the same note an octave above or below, but using only the white keys. The Dorian mode, for example, is not the same as a D major scale, but a sequence of all the white keys from D to D. Therefore the pattern of 'steps' is different for each mode, meaning each mode has different melodic characteristics. Modes are an incredibly important concept to understand in music theory.\n\nTo the right of that are [parallel modes](https://music.stackexchange.com/questions/20196/what-is-a-parallel-mode), which are explained in the text in parentheses - modes and scales that share the same root note.\n\nTo the right is something instantly recognisable to anyone who has studied any music theory - [the circle of fifths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_fifths). It's an incredibly useful graph that shows the relationship between all 12 tones of the chromatic scale. People have written entire books on the circle of fifths alone, if you can take anything away from OP's resource then this should probably be it. There's too much to explain in detail, but basically the red numbers are the keys (start at C in a clockwise direction and notice that each key goes up by a fifth, and each time you go up by a fifth you gain a sharp in the key signature or lose a flat). The number in the grey ring indicates how many sharps or flats there are in that key signature. The green number indicates the relative minor key. B/Cb and Db/C# are enharmonic - essentially the same notes, but expressed differently.\n\nTo the right of the circle of fifths, that big list shows the degrees of the scale that are present in each [chord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_(music\\)). This is especially useful to people who follow [lead sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_sheet). So a major chord is the 1st, major 3rd, and 5th degrees of the scale played together (e.g. C is C, E, and G). A minor7 chord is the 1st, minor 3rd, 5th, and minor 7th degrees (e.g. Cm7 is C, Eb, G, Bb). And so on.\n\nGoing back to the left side, the \"common progressions\" shows common [chord progressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_progression) in music. That is, chords that are commonly played in a particular sequence. Knowing these is helpful.\n\nTo the right of that shows modal interchanges, also known as [\"borrowed chords\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borrowed_chord). This basically means using chords that are outside of the key you're in. Borrowed chords sound colourful because they borrow notes from different modes. It's easier to think of these as key changes that aren't actually key changes - you're suggesting notes from other modes, without actually switching to another mode.\n\nAt the bottom are [chord substitutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chord_substitution). Chord substitutions are a great way to make your music sound more dynamic and less samey - what you're doing is replacing a chord with another chord that serves the same function. These are used a lot in jazz music and they're great for subverting the expectations of the listener. Honestly, the best way to learn how to use these is to understand the theory and experiment with them yourself. The explanations that OP gives for each one are pretty helpful."}, {"comment_id": "err3q1a", "post_id": "c3hf89", "comment": "This rocks hard. Thanks for taking the time to make this.

Some are very feelsy, like romanticism, extremely expressive, like expressionism (and kind of impressionism) but some types of atonalism and serialism doesn\u2019t not convey feeling, at least as a first priority (maybe also some forms of minimalism).

This would probably mean a staggered pattern for walking to minimize head-bobbing, leaving the possible measure up to your whim.\n\nLet's say you had three legs abreast, and kept a standing balance by having big feet. You might move forward in steps using the left and central legs, then right and central, i.e. basically like having two legs; since if you went left-central-right you would wobble and create lateral movement to impede your forward momentum.\n\nHow about having two forward legs and one hind leg, so as to give yourself powerful forward momentum but also an ability to change direction quickly. You might come out with a shuffle rhythm, or in a marching context perhaps a quarter note on the back leg, and sixteenth notes on each front leg.

You see, in the early to late centuries, the violin was growing increasingly discontent with its rather harmono-melodic dichotomy, and composers sought to alleviate this, because if you've ever met a violin you know how annoying they are. Ludwig can Beethoven (an otherwise unremarkable blind composer who mostly did jingles for Sunday morning television) came up with a rather staggering new chroma-temporal revelation for the role of strings. He proposed that, rather than leaving the fiddle's lowest string unused, as was custom for the time in favor of the more screechy cat-summoning upper strings, that you actually play it. This practice became colloquially known as \"screwin' wit' da' G-string, yo.\"\n\nMassive social uproar resulted within the musicology community, which at the time (and to this day) consisted of ten or twelve unemployed, smelly, but otherwise good-intentioned outcasts. Never matter, after a few years it was clear that a directly indirect result of this breakthrough was a widespread fluctuation in the aural vocabulary of observational Neoclassicism - no longer was the bass figured, but rather the figures were the bass, so to speak. So we began to see far more composers use the eighth rest as a tool for expression, rather than simple notation of pitches, for one.\n\nThis is perhaps best seen in the work of Johan Christian Bach, a prolific late Romantic composer and more moderate brother to the infamous man who nearly ruined all music, J.S. Bach. Fuck that guy. Sorry. Anyway my man J.C. could spit, I'll tell you. I don't know how keys work, but I ripped these chords off Ultimate Guitar and they sound legit.

This is where you really start to feel the flavors of the modes.\n\nAlong those lines, a super helpful exercise is to learn to sing all your modes from the same pitch center.   Like, learn to sing Ionian (major) up and down an octave from whatever note you want.   Then sing Aeolian.   Then Phrygian.   Then Lydian.

It gives you a framework for using concepts that you may or may not have ever been able to come up with yourself (or even \"hear in your mind\") and use them because you know how they work despite the fact that they may not be totally innate to your inner ear (yet).  For example, if you understand voice leading, you will end up coming up with some cool chords that you hadn't heard in your head but now they exist because they are an emergent property of your understanding of things on the *conceptual* level.

And I was explaining something simple about scales and intervals, basically saying \"It's more about the relationships between the notes that determines that it will make a certain sound,\" and I was at a keyboard and she basically was like \"Yeah but how come even though when you're doing different shapes in different keys it all still sounds major?\" and I was like \"... Because they still have the same relationships which make the same sounds\"\n\nAnd I'll never forget her honest response was \"Theory is about the SOUND?!\" It was too abstract for her to grasp  that the focus of music and theory had nothing to do with notation but was in fact just a system to organize sound. By the way, this was a girl who played saxophone and flute in high school.\n\nI'm not trying to talk negatively about her, what I'm saying is that we have a cultural problem with the way we teach music in the Western world. We have such a focus on notation that many people (myself included) take a long time to realize what it is that you're saying which is that the whole POINT of theory is to internalize the music in your EARS. This is where music actually happens, in your ears. Notation is a great system to immortalize music in a certain way, but it is NOT music. If you hear a song on the radio and you can grasp immediately what the tonality is, understand the harmonic changes and mentally construct or hum an appropriate Melody, then you're really doing theoretical work in a way that's in conjunction with you're hearing. You should be able to understand music and theory without an instrument or paper. For all kinds of music by the way, atonal classical music, jazz, pop music, funk, etc. They all have different sorts of musical languages theory-wise but it's all just organizations of sound.\n\nAnd to respond to the people who are angry with the poster because apparently you don't have pristine and perfect ears, he's saying the point of learning this stuff is to improve your ears and make sure you're internalizing the sound of these theoretical ideas, in the context of real music. That's when theory will become practical to you in writing and improvisation.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "e1tql79", "post_id": "8w37na", "comment": "I think a big part of the problem is that a lot of people these days think that just about any skill can be *read*. There are a lot of disciplines where this is true, but there are also a lot where this is not true, and you have to physically practice just as much as you have to read.\n\nThis attitude is particularly common on sites like reddit, where the user demographics often skew towards tech types (of which I am one!). You have a lot of people coming from backgrounds where reading actually is what you need to do, just read and apply the concepts in your head and you've got this new skill or talent that you can apply.\n\nSo these types then get interested in music, but they try to apply the methods that work best in other fields to the field of music, not respecting that music has been studied all across the world, in all manner of ways, for literally thousands of years. At this point, the western world has come up a with a decent approach to music education, and teenagers/20-somethings who come from other disciplines do *not* have some unconsidered perspective that is the *one weird trick* needed to unlock the mysteries of music knowledge.\n\nSo you end up with people who can tell you all the rules of species counterpoint, but struggle to write a simple melody. People who can sit down and come up with a really complex cluster chord progression, but struggle to write an actual nice sounding song. Or my favourite; The people who instead of learning to read music, instead think notation is too \"inefficient\" so they try to invent some entirely new system of notation that doesn't even convey everything traditional notation already contains, but they don't even know that its missing *because they couldn't read the notation in the first place!*\n\nOf course, all this isn't to say that there is something wrong with choosing to only approach music from a written, theoretical view.

That's the weird thing about music, you would think if someone could hear something and know immediately what it is they could assimilate a TON of music really fast and they would end up producing something great....yet, there are countless people with incredible ears that don't.  It's the same reason not everyone with perfect pitch is a great musician.  Music skills are a complicated equation.  I liken it to a car with the best set of tires you can buy....without the other components it's not going to suddenly go a lot faster.  You have to up the performance of a lot of components, not just one.\n\nOne of the main reasons I advocate learning by ear to my students is because at some point the memory bank runs out with repertoire/notes/etc.  The more you can depend on your hearing, the less you have to depend on memorizing.  At some point, you hear or hum something in your head and just know where the notes are.  Extremely important if you want to expand your repertoire beyond say 50 songs.\n\nSomething like functional harmony liberates your hearing if you not only study it but use it to figure things out on recordings by ear.  Personally I didn't naturally have good ears, I had to work my tail off at it.  Without understanding functional harmony my ears would have reached a plateau.  The theory allowed me to go beyond. Theory was simply labels and by having nice little labels for things it can help me see and hear them.  An organization principle.\n\nOne problem I have with theory is it often does not accurately represent what is in the scores or recordings.  Which is why everyone should go to the scores or recordings to find the theory of the music they enjoy.\n\nAnywhoo, In summary- Get your ears as far as they can go but realize that 10 mins a day with some ear training app isn't going to suddenly revolutionize your guitar or piano playing.

The apps are very much drudgery to me, whereas figuring out a song by ear, while moderately difficult, is something I do when I'm too lazy to get the sheets, and it is definitely a lot easier for me than using apps for ear-training.

I did my dissertation on music that couldnt be analyzed by normal means and honestly couldn't be understood aurally unless you had perfect pitch (and even then it would be a stretch since seeing it numerically mattered more). Not all music fits into your common practice/jazz theory box where listening to it is how you understand it.\n\nMusic theory is just a set of tools with which we can understand the music placed in front of us.

I feel that there is a lot of knowledge I can share, but there is also infinitely more that I can learn. We're lucky to have some really knowledgeable people around here who are willing to share their expertise and insight without resorting to the usual internet \"you're wrong, and this is why you're wrong\" mindset.\n\nMusic theory is in many ways just a common language, a framework that people from any musical background can pick up and apply it to their own points of reference. So the usual elitism, gatekeeping, fanboyisms etc. that you get throughout different musical *genres* aren't really present when you're talking purely about music *theory*. It's similar to the difference between studying a language and studying linguistics.\n\nAnd this may be a controversial opinion, but one of my absolutely favourite things about this subreddit is rule 3 - *\"no memes, image macros, rage comics, Facebook screenshots, or other similar low-content material\"*. That rule means that this subreddit stays pure content, whether it's people asking questions, sharing resources, discussing what they think are interesting facets of music theory.

I'll also say that this subreddit has evolved tremendously in the decade plus I've been on reddit.   It used to be way much head in the sand the way much of general academia is... totally out of touch with the realities not only working musicians, but the contemporary theory language that those musicians use.  Most programs still seem to pretend that music just stopped changing around 200-250 years ago.\n\nBut I've definitely seen a change.  I think just the pure visibility of *other* music concepts on reddit and youtube make it harder than it used to be to ignore those concepts as being of lesser importance for those nasty jazz and pop musicians.\n\nNow people can earnestly see someone like Adam Neely or just see a conversation on reddit and legitimately think, \"What the fuck is a Cmaj13#11 and why the hell is nobody teaching me about this in the classes I'm paying out the ass for!?\"\n\nI've been preaching the idea that people need to widely broaden their awareness of theory and honestly scrap paying attention to some of the stuff that many music schools still focus heavily on for years now.  I had to come to a person very harsh reality check about my musical knowledge once I started freelancing and I just wanted to warn others.\n\nBack in the day I would just get dismissed.  People still thought Kostka & Payne was a great text and that everything from common practice period theory was all they ever needed.\n\nIt's usually current music student who think they know everything because they haven't had to put their very abstract knowledge of 18th century counterpoint and microtonal systems to work... where they would realize nobody gives a shit.\n\nNo doubt those people grew up and out of college and found out the hard way.  I used to get guff from performance majors who thought I was wrong about the realities of getting a job in an orchestra or in classical only performance in general.  I mean, I still do, but now I see people going down the path I warned them of... that over specialization for a field that has no demand... no matter how good you are and how hard you work, it's just not enough.  You're unlikely to be employed there.  And yeah, so many posters actually ended up going back and getting a masters in something else when their career path wasn't viable.\n\nI'm finding that most of the music subs I'm involved in are just more hip to these realities.  I'm not trying to crush dreams... just give real perspective from actual experience.\n\nAnd I think it's working.  Not my rants in particular, but I feel like I'm seeing a slow sea change in online music communities where they really area taking these ideas to heart.  In theory for an example people really are willing to look at concepts they don't understand as opportunities to learn rather than doubling down on their insular, narrow academic music ideas.\n\nI think a lot of interesting youtube channels like 8-bit music theory using the language that most working musicians use yet far too many schools still don't... and it really stirs people's curiosity.  I think this particular community, which I don't spend that much time in these days, has gotten a lot of very high quality contributers ( /u/65TwinReverbRI comes immediately to mind).

Some have potential, but you have composed yourself into a corner and can't see which darlings to kill to make it work. Letting it simmer on the backburner is the best way to figure it out IME.\n\nOther stuff you could try:\n\n- Make a different version of it. So you've written a jazz tune that feels a bit off? Try playing it as a country song, a piano ballad, a reggae tune, make it death metal, elevator muzak, bossa nova, pretentious postmodern classical, whatever, go crazy.\n- Delete what you think is the defining idea in your composition, the first thing that started the whole piece, the thing that you bootstrapped from. This defining idea is very likely to be a darling, and clinging to it might blind you to the other good stuff you have in there.\n- Throw the entire thing away. As in, physically destroy all the material you have - sheet music, recordings, sketches, everything. If the ideas were any good, they'll come back when there's a use for them.

The entropy of a single chord does not mean anything. Rather, the entropy of \u201cmajor-mode tonal music\u201d measures how equally the various scale degrees are used in this music. Also, entropy 0 (for V7/IV) is an exceptional case.\n\nWriting this, I realize that the problem probably lies in your definition of entropy, and that you probably meant \u201centropy of the next chord, knowing that the current chord is V7/IV, is 0\u201d, which means that the next chord is fully determined \u2013 but then, in practice this is not the case (V7/IV can be followed by IV, iv, V/V7, or even ii)."}, {"comment_id": "eeasykh", "post_id": "agzy41", "comment": "This is scary cool!

Academically better than average (at least in my state, which is one of the worst for education in the US).  Taller than average.   Etc.

I've really had to work at music to get where I am, and having put the last 5 or 6 years HARD into music (I'm 35), I'm coming to realize I'm nothing special in music.

Or are their gifts balanced out in some ways?   Do you ever find that musicians without such freakish gifts are generally better musicians/composers/etc (whatever that means to you)?   Genuinely curious about that!

Over the past couple weeks, right after waking up, I've accurately sung an A with no reference pitch.\n\nI can accurately hear an A, G, and F in my head but have to use interval knowledge/ear training based off of the ones I have in my head to get the other pitches. (I check by singing into a tuner)\n\nI developed this by finding two or three songs that are in the key of A or start with an A in the first one or two pitches and only listening to these songs literally all day every second I can. Once you can recall the note, feel free to ditch the songs as long as you test yourself a couple times a day. (Make sure you have no reference. You're only cheating yourself lol)\n\nWarnings: Make sure the songs use an IN TUNE A. It will fuck you up to listen to slightly out of tune pitches. So for the most part that just means avoid lo-fi. Unlike PP, it's also important to continuously test/push yourself to remember pitches for aural recall, or you'll start to lose it.\n\nEdit: another warning"}, {"comment_id": "emd82xx", "post_id": "bk26eh", "comment": "Nice write up!"}, {"comment_id": "emdspz9", "post_id": "bk26eh", "comment": "Interesting. I don't consider myself to have perfect pitch, but I do use the trick of recalling music I know of. In particular, I remember the first note or a memorable note in music I know and use it as an internal reference. But since I don't really know what to call the note by itself, I don't really use that information. In my mind, it's just \"the first high note of Chopin's 'Raindrop Prelude'\", or \"the note of the extended I in the 'I'm on a hiiiiighway to hell' of AC/DC's Highway To Hell\"\n\nSo I decided to try it out one day to see if this actually worked. I wrote some code to generate random pure tune for some note frequency, and I tried to relate it to some song I know. Then I opened the music in an audio program and looked at the frequency spectrum at the relevant portion of the audio. If that frequency is right, there'll be a sharp peak in the spectrum.\n\nI usually got pretty close. But I have a really hard time breaking apart chords, because I always hear one note dominating it, and I never found a pattern for which note dominates in my mind.\n\nSo to me, it seems that perfect pitch is more of a \"conceptual naming\" skill. It's no wonder it has to be developed earlier in life. There have been experiments where people's perception and naming of colors is tightly related to their language and terms they have available to distinguish the colors. It makes perfect sense, at least to me, that perfect pitch would also be related to this feature of the human brain.\n\nAll that being said, I'd recommend you guys try the \"reference music\" experiment. If you don't want to mess around with an audio program (I used Audacity, it even shows you the note), you can just look up the sheet music or something to see if it matches."}, {"comment_id": "emdsxvm", "post_id": "bk26eh", "comment": "Perfect pitch person here, that 'perfect rhythm' thing is amazing to me.

I could hear a Lydian sound and replicate it but had no name for it until I learnt what a Cmaj7#11 was, and how it can be summarised to II/I (D/C). As I've learnt more, I have been likening sounds to a song, so 'So What' on Kind of Blue to Dorian, certain vamps from Jacob Collier songs can be a brighter Lydian (if that's with his Super-Ultra-Hyper-Mega-Meta Lydian thing or just with some microtonal tomfoolery), and so on. Some sounds are just extremely distinctive, such as the Altered tonality (C7 #9 b9 b13), so they are quick to realise.\n\nBesides all this, I never properly knew what solfege was until recently, and have been trying to figure the whole moveable Do thing and how it helps as it's so alien to me, however it is fascinating!"}, {"comment_id": "emffc5v", "post_id": "bk26eh", "comment": "If you hear one note and can tell somebody what it is, that\u2019s perfect pitch.

I should mention that no one in this group is ever allowed to touch an instrument, trainee instrumentalists have individual lessons at another time.

Then it simply repeats the same melody and lands back on the tonic instead of the submediant. By outlining the minor dominant of a chord, you can make a change seem even smoother, which was already smooth in the first place.

Classical training equips you with the tools to parse and deconstruct any music you hear.\n\nIt doesn't mean that you come out the other end only being able to play or enjoy classical music. It means that you have the classical fundamentals of music under your belt and can go from there.\n\nIn the end, you're going to be drawn to the kind of music that feels right to you. That's going to happen no matter your musical education. However, I believe that formal classical training gives you the strongest toolset that you can then add to in the future to help you understand other forms of music. Having a musical vocabulary, which is universal, is also an integral part of a classical education - being able to recognise, describe, and communicate musical ideas and theories is integral to expanding your musical knowledge of any genre or form.\n\nIt's a little like how learning the English alphabet won't teach you how to read French, or German, or Spanish, or any other language.

There is a bit of smug disregard for non-classical styles.\n\nIf you want to make a career out of music you MUST supplement your classical training and sadly that means most of your music degrees.  For what people are paying, they SHOULD be covering a lot more ground (and discarding a lot more detritus).  Yes, the experience and exposure to so many other musicians and ensembles in a classical setting was extremely valuable to me.\n\nBut so was getting put in my place in the real world when I didn't know shit about jazz or contemporary theory or have the language and skills of most working musicians because it's just not covered in the academic world that pretends that everyone is going to go be a classical concert pianist or an orchestra musician.  Those jobs practically don't exist and there's an ever increasing supply with diminishing demand. You NEED to be a more rounded musician.\n\nSo this door swings both ways.\n\nBut hell, even if you don't plan to be a performer, you owe it to your future students to not continue the cycle of ignorance that comes from dismissing and ignoring all of the extremely important things that are going on outside of the classical space.  There's essentially 200 years of music that most common practice period focused theory classes virtually pretend doesn't exist and a whole language of theory that people aren't learning.\n\nIt's getting better, especially because of the visibility on Youtube and reddit.  I think classical only musicians are getting exposure and rightly thinking, \"Why didn't anyone teach me this?  Why don't I know what these chord names means?  Why wasn't tritone substitution covered when everyone is talking about it online.\n\nHell, just the change I've seen on this sub in the last decade is heartening.

I liken it to switching the lights on.   In the dark (or the ill-lit gloom) of self-teaching, you can find you way around wherever you are, and even make yourself at home.   You can use whatever light there is (what you pick up from the music you learn) as a rough guide, and get comfortable with that.  You might feel your way into the unlit corners if you're curious, and work by feel there too.   But the light of theory makes everything clear, so you can see it all.   You can still stay in your comfortable home or room, you don't have to follow the light into other spaces if you can see that they don't interest you.

You've acknowledged that it really is about your inner ear and how well you can identify what you hear in your head.\n\nHowever, as for accessing this imagination anywhere, I believe that this occurs because your brain doesn't have anything else to focus on. It happens to me too, in bed, in the shower, when I'm out somewhere but incredibly bored. In fact the only one of these compositions I've ever committed to memory occured to me during a Christmas church service. I repeated it over and over in my mind so I wouldn't lose it. I can still remember it today.\n\nTo achieve this in a useful setting, like sitting in front of your instrument, you have to put your mind into a state where it can wander off to produce these pieces. Take your hands away from the instrument, just sit and think for a while. Don't try to figure anything out until the idea has fully developed and you can recall it from start to finish (or just the parts that you like). Once you have a firm grasp on what's going on and you can hear each phrase/bar/section individually, then go to your instrument and begin to translate it through your fingers. The problem with rushing into it is you'll cloud your short term memory/immediate conscious with extraneous and wrong notes as you try to figure it out and then you'll lose the piece. \n\nIf you need some help getting these ideas to form in your head I would also suggest listening to some inspiring music (probably in the style/genre you want to write) before you sit down. Really try to access your imagination, put yourself there with the musicians, playing along with them. Essentially you should start day dreaming and then the ideas will come.

First noticed it when I was a teenager, and it frustrated the hell out of me that I couldn't just pull those ideas out of my head. They're like dreams, they fade quickly from memory and are usually too complex to write down on the fly. \n\nI've seen posts like this before and one thing I find interesting is that the music is different for different people. When I was younger it was mashup between classical music and heavy metal drums and guitar riffs. I stopped playing metal and for the most part stopped listening to it, and I no longer hear the metal parts. Other people here have commented saying they hear rock. Classical seems to be a common theme though, even amongst people who don't listen to a lot of classical music, though I suppose we all hear enough of it though film scores etc to keep it active, and it's a genre with seemingly endless creative possibilities, not to mention often exposed to children at a young age where it impacts out brains positively.\n\nAnyway, a few things I've noticed over the years (I'm 36):\n\nWeed makes the music louder. Not better, certainly not easier to capture, but definitely louder. I have a distinct childhood (teenage) memory of being amazed one of the first times I smoked weed that the music was as loud as as if I had headphones on.\n\nAlcohol suppresses it, makes it go away. Drink in moderation and not every night like I tend to do.\n\nIf you stop playing music, the music in your head goes away. I stopped playing for a few years and it went away. I thought maybe I had outgrown it but when I started playing again, it returned.\n\nI've given up on trying to capture the music in any exact sense. Instead I use it as inspiration - knowing that my brain has the ability to create these ideas helps me keep trying to compose. The process for the music that I do write has to be different because it has to be a conscious process, but I know that the ability to compose similar music is within my ability of I can find the right conscious process to use. \n\nI also try to use it more directly by trying to imitate the overall character of the unconscious music. I know I won't remember every line, but my conscious mind can come up with new lines. I will take note of what the overall feel was - tempo, rhythm, instrumentation, etc and try to replicate that.

There are really two things at issue here. The first issue is the increased quality of those pre-sleep compositions. The second is the difficulty you have writing them down.\u00a0\n\n\nAs to the second, I would say that practice will solve that problem. I use to write down my dreams. At first, I would get only a few vague fragments. But in a very short time I was able to recall vast and highly detailed dreams. So, just like with your instrument, never underestimate the power/value of practice. So just keep doing it, your recall will increase.\n\n\nAs to the first issue, the enhanced quality, that's fascinating. I see two possibilities.\n\n\n1) They aren't more interesting ideas. You are just appreciating them more. How? Maybe you are in a happier state. Imagine how much happier you are when you're laying down to sleep, the day's tasks completed. You're not working, or doing laundry, or paying bills, etc. This is a good state of mind.\u00a0\n\n\nImagine that a friend takes you out for pizza on a Thursday evening for no significant reason. That pizza tastes good, right? Now, imagine a friend takes you out for pizza on a Friday, after having just earned your Ph.D. Now, how good does that pizza taste? It's the most magnificent pizza ever, that's how good! See what I mean? We can appreciate things more or less depending on other things in our life. I'm not saying that's what's happening, I'm just saying that it's possible.\n\n\n2) The compositions really are better. Well, this could very much be related to possibility #1. Which is to say, you are in a better frame of mind to allow these higher quality thoughts to emerge. More relaxed, more in tune with your imagination. There is probably less noise in your environment. It's dark. You are no longer thinking about work, laundry, paying bills, etc. So you could try recreating the environment that enables these higher quality thoughts in your practice space.\n\n\nOf course it could be a combination of both of these things: you are both more appreciative AND producing higher quality thoughts.\n\n\nAnyway, good luck! Good problem to have, I think, wondering how to capture all these great ideas.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dv2z9kq", "post_id": "81b6kb", "comment": "I have only written spontaneously in my sleep.

I've formally studied neuropsychology and philosophy of science and have given this a bit of thought:\n\n The thing is, retrospective analysis of is incredibly difficult, even from a neurological standpoint.  When you aren't cognitively able to attend to much (i.e just before sleep) all that's really there is [Flow] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_\\(psychology) which is kind of like autopilot immersion.  Hypnagogic states are special because the brain has sort of sidechained (so to speak) waking consciousness-- autonomous functions take over and electrical activity slows to prepare the nervous system for sleep.  \n \nAt the same time,  if focus is directed at music ( or art or anything really ) as this state onsets, I think the [memory consolidation processes inherent in sleep] (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3278619/) kind of combine with self-directedness and focus on whatever modality is under the spotlight of consciousness, so to speak.  Consolidation is a process of integration and association to further integration.  This is why ideas 'flow' continuously yet there are motifs under the surface that bind the flow.  I think this is why things never sound right when transcribed ad hoc, either the motifs or the flow breaks through.  \n\nHopefully one day soon-ish we'll have musical tech that allows direct transcription from intention-- as [it's already been fairly established that musicians have specific anatomical and functional differences from non-musicians] (http://gottfriedschlaug.org/musicianbrain/papers/Bangert_Schlaug_Keyboard-String.pdf).

Given you move from \"pentatonic\" (5-note) it looks like you think \"diatonic\" means\" 7-note\", but it doesn't.  It would be possible to show two other modes (mixolydian and lydian) based on the same shapes, which would still be \"diatonic\", but based off other major scales.\n\nIOW, nothing wrong with this aside from a couple of potentially misleading terms.\n\nThe addition I'd suggest - it might need more than one other page! - is to take each of the major scale patterns, and mark them up with the arpeggios of the other chords in the pattern.   At the moment you're moving (left to right) from the I chord toward the whole major scale of that key, in a good logical manner.

"}, {"comment_id": "efn48y5", "post_id": "amh7wz", "comment": "Hello! I wanted to make a comment in this thread about my thoughts and concerns with the game! I want to preface this comment by saying that I love the game and even though I keep failing and failing it is still loads of fun! I also want to say that I have basically zero knowledge music theory, so I may not be your target audience and I may actually not be playing the game \"right\" as others who do have music theory knowledge may navigate the game.\n___\nThe game is addicting, it really really is fun. I think the most amazing thing about the game design is actually the \"menu\" where you navigate to different worlds/levels through the rhythm mechanic itself. That is very clever and that is the type of design that shows that the creators really know what they are going for. Beginning it was a task just to start playing the game. It holds no punches and does not patronize the player even if it is actually quite hard for some casual passerby.\n\nThe visuals are simple, yet stunning. Even as a very severely colorblind person, I have had no problems so far following the screen and the orbs. I have to say that is a feat in itself and I really appreciate the good vibrant palette. It really fits in with the whole premise on it being a visual game.\n\nThe controls are simple. One button, how hard is that? It seems responsive and I have only had one problem in that using the space bar is the best button, but it can be a bit taxing on the hand, arm, and wrist because it is not too comfortable for normal keyboard hand placement. A minor thing, you sorta' forget about it when playing.\n\nGameplay, is as I said before addicting and it just captivates you into the \"zone\". I cannot count how many times I have failed already and yet I, even now am craving to get back into playing \"just one more time\".\n___\nCons & Concerns:\n\nI really really hate the name. Partially because I really hate GoT and the reference is cheesy, but most of all the reference has nothing to do with the game itself nor GoT.\n\nSo, being a complete idiot with no musical theory knowledge at all (well, very very very little at least) I was concerned about whether or not this game was for me or not. I was also wondering whether or not the premise is to reinforce better rhythm (visually and internally) through its gameplay.\n\nI was concerned about the former because those who DO have musical theory may get more out of this game than just some random person. Thus, they will navigate the game better and get much much more than I would. This is not so much a fundamental concern, but it ties in with my latter concern:\n\n\"Is this game meant to reinforce visual and internal rhythm through its gameplay, and if so. Does it succeed in that?\" If yes, then trying to assess whether or not it succeeds is dependent upon a lot of factors such as: \n\n* \"How long would it take an average person with no Music Theory to see any benefit?\"\n\n* \"Is it meant to reinforce understanding of rhythm visually or internally?\"\n\n* \"What is the optimal way to study the game while playing to get the most of it?\"\n\nRegardless, my biggest concern is if it IS supposed to reinforce internal rhythm through playing the game I unfortunately have to say that it fails in that regard (much like every other 'rhythm' based game). I went back and played through up to world 4 on \"Perfect Only\" and got to the point where I could beat 3-X 100%. I then went to try it without sound and I found that I can hardly get past the first couple of bends/turns. Again, I have only played about 5 hours of it so far, so I may need to play significantly more until I actually find a difference in internal rhythm, but what I found is the problem with every other rhythm game which is that I am not actually grasping rhythm better I am just learning the stage's patterns through visual and audio cues.\n\nThe problem with this is not that I am consciously relating the shapes with certain rhythmic patterns, but rather I am just playing  \"Simon Says\" with audio cues.\n\nSure, I see certain block patterns and I know that at that time I need to press it in a certain way/pattern, but it is does not help me execute rhythm on command - only in context to that stage. That is the problem - I am just learning the stage.\n\nNow again, that is probably the \"wrong\" way to get what the design originally intends. I probably should be focusing on consciously learning those visual rhythmic patterns, I have not quite yet and that is an \"user error\", but the concern I have is that it does not inherently help (or at least not yet for me) the player gain any better understanding of rhythm.\n\nI will end it with saying that it will probably be an amazing supplement.\n___\n\nAll in all, it is a fabulous game and I have bought it on steam and will probably donate money on your site to help you in any way it can.\n\nSomethings I would like to see are:\n\n* An option to show the BPM and ability to change the BPM.\n* User Stage Creation.\n* Ability to change and put different time signatures.\n* Ability to put time counters on the blocks (so that blocks would have 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4).\n\nA great game.

The general rule that will put you in good stead 99% of the time is to avoid using the same letter twice in a row. Thus, D Hungarian Folk should be D Eb F# G A Bb C# D. This is both easier to read on sheet music (so that different lines and spaces can indicate note changes), and will always lead to the same intervals, even when you change tonics.  (So the first step there will always be a minor second, and never an augmented 1st)\n\nUsing the same mode as before, but in Eb, we would get Eb Fb G Ab Bb Cb D Eb. Note that every interval is now identical to what it was before. By avoiding Eb to E, we maintain the minor second relationship in the first scale step.\n\nNote also that the same two notes have been modified from the major key signatures: the 2nd and the 6th. Every other note spelling reflects the corresponding major key signature.\n\nThis rule breaks down a bit when there are more than 7 chord members, such as in chromatic scales or octatonic scales, but it's a good starting place.  It also means that you will have to sometimes with with double sharp and double flat. But, in fairness, these are sometimes the proper spellings for good and systematic reasons.\n\nThe rules for the more complex scales are largely derived from the principles of maximized note differences, and leading tone motions. And all of the proper spellings can be looked up fairly easily.  Since you're trying to create a reference, you should probably take the time to get this right.

You can fix these issues, but be prepared to do serious rewrites of the routines that generate your chords and scales.\n\nA couple things to note:\n\n1. As others have mentioned, enharmonic spellings are frequently wrong. You'll need to impose a rule that forces no repeating of letter names within diatonic scales.\n2. Chords seem to be generated by naively stacking thirds, but this concept is also applied to scales which are basically chormatic, so the \"3rds\" that are being stacked are frequently not 3rds at all. Almost any grouping of notes can be thought of as a chord, but you need to generate them using a more accurate procedure to keep them from becoming nonsensical when derived from exotic scales. Generally speaking, I think you would do better to generate a chromatic scale, and then let the user define their own pattern of intervals to make their own customized subset scale (like the diatonic scale, for example). From there, chords should be built only from true diatonic intervals (usually 3rds), or another clear rule of intentional design imposed by either you or the user. If an appropriate interval is absent from the subset scale, the chord should be omitted. You'll also find that it is again difficult to spell the notes making up the chord correctly, as you will have to force them to comply with some naming rule so that the letter always spells a correct diatonic third interval.\n\nI think your goal should be to make notes objects that are aware of some kind of context which affects the way they express their name and degree. That's how the music system was really designed to work.\n\nLike, yes, you have an A#, but that A# is the 5th pitch class in the Gb chromatic scale, enharmonically respelled because it is the 3rd degree of an F#7 chord on its way to B minor, where the same note will be the raised 7th degree degree of the B minor diatonic scale. In music, sometimes it needs to be all of those things at once, so I think it is helpful to design it in a way where that plurality can exist."}, {"comment_id": "f1r7d04", "post_id": "dalzk2", "comment": "> [Check out chords for any note, they're formulas and more.](https://scale-heaven.com/chord-heaven) \n\nShould be \"their.\""}, {"comment_id": "en1lctc", "post_id": "bn1h8h", "comment": "Or, \"musical\" blue balls (broadway musical) would be if Chekhov's gun never made a second appearance."}, {"comment_id": "en1zox3", "post_id": "bn1h8h", "comment": "Looking at you Wagner"}, {"comment_id": "en1wsak", "post_id": "bn1h8h", "comment": "When she ends on Ebmaj7 \ud83e\udd15"}, {"comment_id": "en1nq9a", "post_id": "bn1h8h", "comment": "Unresolved Leading tone is what men of culture refer to blue balls as."}, {"comment_id": "en2hert", "post_id": "bn1h8h", "comment": "Meh, that's barely even edging.

"}, {"comment_id": "e7uyoye", "post_id": "9oj658", "comment": "I once attended a jazz summer school run by Jamey Aebersold, who told us how he had trained himself to gain absolute pitch, using a chromatic pitch pipe to test himself, over several weeks whenever he went jogging.   The question that nobody asked, unfortunately, was whether it had really benefited his musicianship.  Perhaps he felt it had - but if so, I suspect it was due to a general improvement in his ear.\n\nSo I'm not surprised by this research, or disbelieving.  The whole paper is worth reading, because it does answer one significant question: Did the participants retain this skill for weeks, months after the experiment?\n\nIt turns out the successful trainees (the 14% who scored higher than 90% accuracy) were tested again a month later.  Their skill seems to have held up well, but had still reduced - and had reduced further after three months.  \n \nThat suggests it's a well-trained \"pitch memory\", not absolute pitch.  As anyone with AP would attest, it's 100% all the time (pretty much), although it has been known to wear off in old age.\n\nThe other important question that is not addressed (being outside the remit of the research, obviously) is - is there any point to this?  Is AP really a useful musical skill?  The paper mentions a widespread view that it's regarded as an \"endowment of gifted musicians\", but who by?  The musicians themselves?  How many of those with AP regarded it as essential or highly useful?  How many of those without it yearn to have it?   \n\n> It is widely believed that acquiring AP in adulthood is impossible, since AP is only for the selected few with rare genetic makeup and early musical training. \n\nThis is the myth that the researchers have seemingly managed to demolish - good, but it is really only a myth, \"widely believed\".  \n\nThey seem to have proved that AP is more learnable than most people think - or (at least) that pitch memory can be trained to get \"close enough\" to AP.  \n\nMore significantly, perhaps, it suggests that AP could just be the top end of a spectrum of pitch skills, not a unique perceptual quality at all.  \n\nThe paper mentions one estimate of AP being possessed by only 1 in 10,000 of the population, but - while they mention plenty of research in their hunt for a usable definition of AP - they don't mention the much higher incidence among tonal language speakers, which strongly suggests that environmental influence during infancy (when language is being learned) is way more important than genetic factors, and that the latter may have no impact at all.   \nI.e., the paper does mention AP's well-known connection with learning speech, but not the tonal language difference.   \nThose tonal language speakers who have it may not have had \"early musical training\", and it doesn't make much sense that a \"rare genetic\" trait could be that much less rare in tonal language speakers.  (Or perhaps it does, given that most tonal languages are Oriental?)\n\nIn any case, the big question - carefully avoided by the paper - is: does any of this matter?  There is still the central myth at work throughout: that AP is an enviable musical \"gift\", that any musician would be grateful to have.  \nIt may be true that AP can enhance one's enjoyment of music (I wouldn't know, of course).  But AP is irrelevant to how music works, which is through *relative pitch*.  AP can't help you *understand* music any better, either as a listener or as a musician.  For a musician, it can make some processes marginally quicker; but it can also get in the way.  "}, {"comment_id": "e7ul6df", "post_id": "9oj658", "comment": ">For example, there could be different forms of pitch representations in the trained AP, such as representing each pitch in an absolute manner, or representing some of the pitches in an absolute manner while performing AP naming for other pitches by relative comparison of the tones to the internally generated references. The latter form of trained AP would be similar to the \u2018Absolute A\u2019, which is considered a subtype of \u2018AP possessors\u2019 that only possess AP memory with the pitch \u2018A\u2019, but are able to perform accurate AP judgment by applying relative pitch judgment based on the internal memory of \u2018A\u2019 (Levitin & Rogers, 2005). Our AP measures could not differentiate between these different forms of AP representation.\n\nFrom what I understand, the latter is what some people call \"pitch memory\" from which one can use their relative pitch to discern the other 11 notes in the chromatic scale. Is this really AP? Absolute pitch should be as instinctive as identifying colors - one should not need to think from a reference color like green to identify a red apple. Without a means of differentiating the two types of AP which the authors have identified, all this study has shown is the efficacy of pitch memory, which raises a bunch more questions because they did not control for the fact that all the participants were speakers of a tonal language (Cantonese) and all the people who \"acquired AP\" were musically trained."}, {"comment_id": "e7ujomv", "post_id": "9oj658", "comment": "There was also a study on an epilepsy medication succesfully reoppening the critical period and enabling some adults to learn perfect pitch."}, {"comment_id": "e7umebz", "post_id": "9oj658", "comment": "Where can I find this program?"}, {"comment_id": "e7ur4s9", "post_id": "9oj658", "comment": "I think it's important to highlight a key missing element in this study.

The study is missing info regarding the influence of relative pitch that may provide a false image.\n\nAP is innate and grants those who have it native fluency for music.

Rhythm sections (drums, bass, comping instruments) tend to excel when you give them general roadmaps. \n\ni.e: Lots of articulations, dynamic markings, and stylistic info for the trumpet... \"Play Funk 8 bars\" for the drummer. \n\n-On that note, unless you have something incredibly specific in mind, trust that your piano/guitar player knows better chord voicings than you, bassists know how to walk better than you, your drummer can fill better than you, and that your soloists can solo better than you. If they prove you wrong, feel free to give them a written chart of shame. \n\n-m2nds are hard for ensembles to keep in pitch. Generally try to avoid putting them near the top of a voicing.\n\n-Brass players' endurance is a lot like lifting weights. You can either do a lot of weight or a lot of reps, but rarely both. If you need them to play a lot of high notes, let them rest. If you need them to play for a long time, don't make them push the limits of their range.\n\n-Get as much experience with the instruments you're writing for as possible. It sucks to have your beautiful harmonics line scrapped because the guitar can't actually play the notes you wrote. \n\nIf you're writing: \n\n-Make the sheet music as simple as possible. 4/8 bars per system, bigass rehearsal marks, unambiguous chord symbols.\n\n-Also, if this is an option for you, write for the musician and not for the instrument. Classical musicians are more likely to quickly understand E\u00f8 whereas Jazz music tend to prefer Em7b5. A rock guitarist is far more likely to understand B (power chord) than B(no3). If you know the musicians who will be playing the music, there's nothing wrong with being as casual or niche as you want to get your point across. \n\n-If you're using Sibelius, go ahead and go to House Style -> Engraving Rules -> Chord Symbols, then disable the chord diagrams for guitar and burn that option away so you never see it again."}, {"comment_id": "eyerrwv", "post_id": "cwpyy7", "comment": "PROTIP: Make sure the synth and vocals are in the same key."}, {"comment_id": "eye273w", "post_id": "cwpyy7", "comment": "Understand what playing a part would feel like from the musician's perspective, and that will help circle back to what instinctively sounds best.

The use of either similar or different voicing (timbre/tone/texture or however you break it down) will set a mood.  Ultimately you could run off into the % likelihoods of sound system capabilities and that wouldn't be unreasonable regarding 'separation of sound' but to speak from a puritan basis: the more the instruments sound different, the more variation they have in range of pitch, and the more obvious variation there is between them the more distinguishable the parts are and the more its noticeable if they're working together or not.\n\nI don't mean to word it like an a\\*\\*hole but if you consider like a traditional techno sound - everything is completely synced via harmony, melody, progression, separation of voicing, etc. whereas jazz/folk/hiphop - often times asynchronous. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n 2) **make sure different instruments complement each other rhythmically** \n\nTiming is everything, sure. Different instruments may fill in or join together or solo/be quiet for various periods to create different moods, but being aware of how they carry together throughout a composition often times focuses on a 'rhythmic rendezvous'  when the harmony is lead by an instrument and others are allowed to pip, reinforce, or counter. \n\n3) **less is more** \n\nThis is a dangerous concept. Less ... work? less sound? less music less silence? There is a natural truth to simplicity and not over working a composition or instrumentation . However - Maybe more truthfully: Enough is enough. ??  :: At some point you'll realize you've wasted time and at that point you can go back and try to make sense of what  you should have been doing instead. Personally I think it's easy to get caught up in the human act of conquest when trying to understand music / music composition / recording / performing. but all of these are different beasts. The dimensions of music balance each add to each other and show themselves in regards to what the composer finds novel about that work. Sometimes less is more. Sometimes more is neessary. Sometimes we are expressions of ourselves  or something else entirely,\n\n4)  **if mixing it takes a lot of effort, it's probably badly arranged**.\n\nmore than anything i want you to know that this is not true. I say that because this is asking when to stop dancing. you have to develop a feel for when is right for you. A great escape is why is the mixing taking a while - well if its because you're new to the elements : new program, new idea, new genre, new material : whatever it is : there might be a technicality - similar to a physicality as to why its taking longer than expected to put together. \n\nI would suggest that if mixing it takes a lot of effort its never because of the arrangement but because of the approach, a misappropriate of ambition/intent, or because  somehow mixing and arranging were seen as two totally different processes. They mean almost the same thing and musically, the idea of mixing x arranging should be shared so that the process and output can both  be recognized.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nGreat questions"}, {"comment_id": "eye7844", "post_id": "cwpyy7", "comment": "Try to stay with the original material as much as possible, don\u2019t take too many liberties with the music.

There is a constant slide up and down lightly brushing the strings. This drops in atonal notes into the background.\n2. The rhythm guitar part is constantly bending each note out of tune in a wobbly vibrato. Lots of notes going out of tune in each direction can feel strange or wrong.\n3. The lead guitar is played jagged and staccato against a smooth wobbly background.\n4. The main melody is the 5th, the tritone, and the sixth. (B, A#, C#) The rhythm part is just the 1st and the 5th. (E and B). The tritone is a traditionally dissonant note. Since it's so sparse, since there is little to inform your ear of the mood, that tritone might carry a lot of weight in your ear.\n5. This also gives a feeling as though the chord is not resolved, this is not the \"home base\" chord, this is not the tonic. This can feel like it should go somewhere else and stop lingering here.. and yet it lingers.\n6. When it goes to the B section, the more open chord part, it now clearly has a major third. The chord is a B. It is very normal to go to this chord, but the way the lead guitar plays is extremely sloppy and dirty for something so simple and small.\n7. During this sloppy feel, the lead guitar is playing an open B string, while the rhythm guitar is playing that same B up the neck, and is wobbling it out of tune. This is the same note on two instruments, but one is going slightly out of tune. That is a dissonance that can bother people.\n8. I don't suspect the C section to be the problem. That's the part that goes up right before the end (starts around 30 seconds in.) Really a pleasant section. I've always found it to be a easy going and clever way to develop the motif so that it felt like it was pointing to an end.\n\nAnd that's all the elements that could be causing this experience for many listeners.\n\nI've always loved this song and found it to be a pleasant jaunt.

It sounds just barely \"wrong\", you know. Also, the way they hang on to the same chord for just too long gives it a sensation that it *wants* to sound playful.\n\nAn immediate correlation I can make, going back to my own childhood, is to those cheesy TV production logos and adverts, and the way they can look old, damaged and \"wrong\".

(spongebob is a guy like that if you were to reason)\n\nWell, while doing bad stuff might be funny, the consequences of doing bad things is going to hell (which is scary), just like this music. It's funny, but makes you feel scared at the same time. \n\nSo to conclude, our minds relate this music to things that has high entropy. And the hell (in theory) is the origin of all entropy.

It feels like there's always a little something lurking-- a silver lining to your cloud, or a dark cloud on the horizon to your sunny sky.\n\nThere's no other mode where I have anything approaching a consistent vibe.  Some of this is no doubt because I'm not that well-trained and I may not even be able to pick them out or have thought about them much.  But even like Mixolydian or major where I can easily pick them out... I just hear them in a very clinical way.  Like \"oh, there's that b7.\"  \n\nI can get why people will say Mixolydian is happy, confident, bouncy and sort of hear those aspects if I try.  But it doesn't naturally provoke a response from me.  Mixolydian is just.... Mixolydian.  The best I can do with most modes is maybe \"Well.. that sounds maybe a little Spanish\" or \"Yeah, maybe kinda Eastern, maybe.  Oh wait, that song is in that same mode?  Well forget it then.\"\n\nI listened to a shit-ton of Pink Floyd growing up and David Gilmour was probably my biggest early influence and reason I picked up guitar in the first place.  So that probably has a lot to do with my feelings towards Dorian."}, {"comment_id": "ek3co0h", "post_id": "b9ao5d", "comment": "What does P mean"}, {"comment_id": "ek3xssj", "post_id": "b9ao5d", "comment": "To me Mixolydian is one of the most versatile modes and can have a wide range of feelings depending on how you use it.

I'm not sure if this has been done somewhere before.\n\nYou should be able to choose which strings the notes are on or if they are open strings. On a 24 fret guitar the bottom string E can be played on all 6 strings, but it sounds a lot different in it's tone when comparing the open string, the 2nd and 3rd strings and the rest. On the top string it clearly has that short, thick-string tonality to it. \n\nIf you want string squeak noises (I consider it a flaw that should be avoided while playing), you can add that automatically.\n\nIt should have a strum effect, and you could also increase/decrease the speed of the strum and the direction of the strum.\n\nPerhaps, there could be an improvement on the hammer on and pull effects.\n\nFinally, there should be a two-factor, non-linear bend option associated with a command to move from A-B at the same rate. This would also be an excellent feature on keyboards to make the pitch-bend wheel sound different. If you analyze guitar string bends, you have two factors at work, and they are actually working in opposite directions. The length of the string is increasing when you bend it, and you are pulling the string tighter. Increasing string length lowers the pitch, while the increase in tightness increases the pitch (obviously the dominant factor since bends increase pitch). The result is the unique string bend sound that sounds a lot better than a keyboard's pitch bend wheel being moved at an equal rate. I have heard someone control the pitch bend wheel carefully to emulate a real string bend, but that takes a lot of skill and would be a nightmare to program. I would also provide unnatural, dual-factor bends just for fun and creative options. I would also provide users the option to make custom pitch bend effects.

If you've looked for sample libraries, you'll have noticed things like Vienna Strings which cost thousands.  I noticed a significant issue with using the Garageband samples for orchestral instruments as the sampler doesn't capture midi data in an effective way.  The main problem is Garageband uses 'velocity' for volume which works for a piano but is not right for a violin.  Garritan uses 'modulation' for string volume which gives much better control.  I recorded a version of Ave Maria using the standard Garageband Strings which gives a reasonable enough result for a but of fun play-along but it a long way from the nuances as you describe in your original post.  I'm going to re-record this using Garritan so that I'll have a 'before and after'.

A nice find. It reminded me of a \"speculative conceptual\" comparison of the overtone series to the increasing of the time signatures and divisions of binary measures with divisions of 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and 9. \n\nIt was not intended to be taken as gospel but more of a speculative analytic comparison to promote thinking out side the box and to explore speculative conceptual concepts. Its not exactly what was in the video, but I did use that as an example but in reverse as I started with the fifth and slowed it down to where the 2/3. 1/2 then 1/1 and continuing to negative numbers in the ration series as we went below the overtone series of 1/1 Did I mention that it was for fun and speculative for opening up avenues of thought?\n\nwhen the ratios got below ONE instead of going negative, however, I kept the denominator as ! do that it did not go into imaginary numbers and increased the rhythmic element like 1 over 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,  as you got to the odd prime numbers of 5 7 I noticed that when drummers play some latin thythms like the Bossa Nova REALLY FAST, they tended to smooth out the bossa rhythm to get closer to 5 equal beats per a measure of ! pulse. and the other odd numbers of 5 and 11 produced other rhythmic \"claves\" and some Indian Tabla rhythms that my Guru could really play as well as some of the rhythms I heard in the drummers of Senegal. As I said, it was speculative and to spur discussion and practice creative thinking skills. Anyway, thanks for triggering the memory. I wish I could find that discussion. I didn't use all my notes and I would like to edit it into a speculative exercise. \n\nThanks again. Its a really enjoyable trip to where no man has gone before in comparing rhythms to notes. And a breath of fresh air to some of the discussions on Reddit. I hope it inspires some to look at what else might be out there that we have not looked at from all the possibles angles and implications. \n\nLJSe7m \n"}, {"comment_id": "d1sjsxx", "post_id": "4div78", "comment": "[Reminds me of this at 3:00](https://youtu.be/0IzlhHz6UKg)"}, {"comment_id": "d1spgis", "post_id": "4div78", "comment": "Wow!"}, {"comment_id": "d1sqhna", "post_id": "4div78", "comment": "At first I smirked at the absurd, stupid title.

What you are theorizing is resampling a \"pattern,\" which is only timing information and not sound information. For the result of this operation to have discernible pitch, the input must be such that it creates output with a somewhat even harmonic series after being sped up, at minimum, on the order of 100x. So if you wanted to create an A 440Hz sine wave tone with even one of the rhythms in the polyrhythm, it would need to be played at 4.4 Hz (quarter notes at 264 bpm) by a sine wave of that exact frequency, which is inaudible.\n\nIn that video, the fundamental of the snare is 200 Hz and the wood block is 1200 Hz, which is the 6th harmonic of 200 Hz, and happens to be a perfect fifth. It's a coincidence, not dependent on the rhythm itself. You can see in [the video] that the speed up is basically smearing the fundamentals into constant tones. This is not being sped up nearly to 100x.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "d1rik8l", "post_id": "4div78", "comment": "2/3 is a fourth, right?\n\nWhat are the other intervals, please?"}, {"comment_id": "d1rkfc6", "post_id": "4div78", "comment": "This is cool!

In C major, the tritone is B and F. \n\nIf you play the B and F together, the B will want to resolve up to C and the F will want to resolve down to E. Try playing it and see how the tritone leads into the key center. The tritone B and F uniquely describe C major because they pull the resolution back to the 1 chord. In C major, the B happens to be the third and F the 7th of a G7 chord. This is not a coincidence, it is why G, specifically G7 resolves so strongly.\n\nIn the key of C, playing a C7 works, but it'll temporarily be acting as though it is a 5th from a different key and want to resolve down to it's 1 (because of the tritone). Even though C is your 1 chord, C7 becomes like a 5 and wants to resolve down to F.\n\nSince F is still in the key of C you can pull it back to C without changing the key of the overall piece."}, {"comment_id": "f0w4cue", "post_id": "d6x955", "comment": "No \n\nYou can't\n\nDon't do it\n\nI'm WARNING YOU\n\nYOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS AT STAKE"}, {"comment_id": "f0w1ds9", "post_id": "d6x955", "comment": "C7 can definitely be used in a progression based in C major, you just borrow the Bb note from the nearby scale of F.

You can **USE** the **C-7 Chord** when playing a melody in C Major Scale, but it cannot be just **FORMED** from the notes of the scale. Let me explain first why you might be confused. The most simple and basic thinking about chords, that the **chord** should **contain** the notes that are **played the most** in that part of the melody, until the next transition with a new set of notes, which leads us using a new chord, and so on. So what really lies behind your question is, **why** should i use a chord containing a note, that i will **never** use in the melody!!\n\nFirst Of All, as general guidelines, you don\\`t have to think that\\`s very complicated stuff, that i should not try now, which is basically not that complicated, and there are no **REAL** boundaries in music, rather than your **ears** and your **mind**, if something sounds **ODD** or unexpected in a bad way, you will **catch** it as a listener, so you should try A LOT, and let your senses guide you to what sounds pleasant or what sounds annoying to you, if you what you composed, was of somebody else, and to judge this right, listen to you stuff, **DAYS LATER** after you finish it, you will always listen to it with fresh ears, not influenced with the excitement of the moment.\n\nThere are **TWO MAIN** reasons, why you could use **C-7 Chord** when composing a melody in **C Major Key**\n\n&#x200B;\n\n1- To give a **taste** to the melody played in **C Major**, with adding an **underlying chord**, with a carefully invited **guest**, to give that part of melody a small gift, and then leaves, or might stay, and become the **home** owner, as will be explained in **Part 2** \n\n\\- Chords should **NOT** be just a **container** for the notes played in that part of the melody, it should **add** some meaning or some **taste**, or should play some role in the whole progression, that\\`s not as complicated as is sounds, there are basic chord progression techniques, that are well known, but what i really mean, is your soul as a composer, you should try, until you develop some sense to feel, what feels different, when you play different chords with different parts of the music.\n\n\\- For Example in **C Major**, the **G** is **5th** Of **C** ..  \n\n\n\\- So if you are playing C Note mostly accompanied with **B** And **F** Notes For Example, and you play **G Major** Chord, you will find it pleasant  \n\n\n\\- The G **Major** Chord **(G B D)** \\-----> **G** is **5th** to **C**  \\------> **B** is **PRESENT** in the melody ----> **F** is **3rd** to **D** in D **minor** Chord **(D F A)**  \n\n\n\\- It won\\`t be in harmony like if you played for example the 3rd inversion of F **Major** Chord **(C F A)** but it can have some role like building some **tension** before **resolving** to Chord I, or to build **more** tension and go in an **unexpected** way!!\n\n\\- In the Locrian Mode played on **E** Note **(E F G A Bb C D E)**    \n\n\n\\- It\\`s the **same** as **C Major Scale**, where E in the Home Note, and **Bb** not **B** Is the **5th** Note, **NOT** the **7th** Note,   \n\n\n\\- **D** is the **3rd** To **Bb**, So playing **(E-F-G-F-E-C-D)** with a **C7 Chord**, will sound good, it\\`s where you **deceive** the lister\\`s ear that they are some how **stealing** something from the E Locrian, which will be noted **slightly** for the **Bb** Note in the Chord, which matches the **E**, and the **D** matches the **Bb** as well.\n\n\\- So in general you can use the **C7** Chord in your progression to **steal** the feeling of another scales using the underlying chords, **without chanigng** the key in your melody  \n\n\n2- To Prepare for a **change** in the key\n\n\\- One Of the most **successful**, and **never stoppable** tricks musicians do, to add **richness** to their pieces, is the make a temporarily **key change**, as going to use the notes of a **different** scale, and then **returning** to use the notes of the main scale you are using.\n\n\\- The change can last to the **end of the melody,** or can last just for **one note**, as stealing one note outside the scale, and returning back, to use **ONLY** the notes of our scale, and **NEVER** do it again  \n\n\n\\- What makes the ears **accept** it, is the fact that our ears accept not hear **all** the scales, the only problem we cannot hear them all **together**, because our minds don\\`t recognize any **system**, and don\\`t know in which scale are we in the moment. So by **borrowing** one or few notes, or even changing the key **totally** with musical phrases formed from the new key, we just **prepare** our ears and minds to the change. So **Simply** our ears was **accepting** listening to a **sequence** of notes from a specific set (**scale**) and then we till them ok, what about listening to other notes from another scale which you also accept!!??  \n\n\n* A Live **Example** Of How you can very very easily use the **C7** Chord to make change your key from **C Major** to **F Major**\n\nPlay  **(E-F-E-G)** In **8th** Notes\n\n\\- With **Chord I** in **C Major** Key **(C-E-G)**\n\nThen play (**F-A-B**) in 8th Notes  And then (**C**) in **half** note\n\n\\- With **Chord IV** in **C Major** Key **(F-A-C)** Which is also **Chord I** in F Major Key\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe Play **(A-G-A-G-F-A-Bb-G-F)** in **8th** Notes And Then (**F**) in **half** Note\n\n\\- With **Chord V** in **F Major** **(C - E - G - Bb)** the **C7** Chord\n\n\\- By Beginning in **Chord I**, you can go **anywhere**, and actually **Chord IV** is the next pleasant move after **Chord V**, So Going From **C Major** To **F Major**, works good, in **C Major** Key, and when we progress to the **F Major** Chord, we are on a **BRIDGE**, which is a chord that exists in **BOTH** scales, and both scales are **similar** except for the **B or Bb**, so we are in a progression the the **4th** chord is **C Major**, but we might be also in a **new** progression, and that\\`s **chord I in the F Major scale**, which is confirmed with a smooth transition to **Chord V** in F Major Key, which is a **perfect** transition as known (Chord **I** \\- Chord **V**)\n\nI am sorry for being that long, but i hope i could add some points."}, {"comment_id": "f0w5qk5", "post_id": "d6x955", "comment": "https://youtu.be/3Gj0vl2zI58"}, {"comment_id": "f0w6mmj", "post_id": "d6x955", "comment": "Using the tonic 7 chord is super nice!

There are a few basic differences when compared to the usual Western music, depending on who's singing the psalms and how.  Plenty of melodies -- actual melodies, not chanting -- are no different from any other Western melody.  Chanting is what's special, and that takes several forms.  The most important common difference between Jewish chanting and most Western music is that, in chanting, the music serves the words: it's logogenic, not melogenic.  A long phrase just means you stay on the same note for many syllables.  In that sense, it's pretty much the same as a recitative in an opera.  In some Jewish cultures, there might be motifs combined in an improvisatory way.  Ashkenazim chant most prayers like this, using special melodies for some texts and straight-up motivic chanting for others.  Cantors who like to show off will improvise more heavily, outside the traditional motifs but within the mode.  Syrian Jews chant prayers with much more improvisation, with only the mode specified.  Sepharadim generally chant psalms in a fairly consistent way: using the cantillation symbols printed in the Masoretic text.  Those symbols don't entirely dictate the melody and rhythm; there may be a few variations on how to chant a particular stich.  However, the motifs used are easily transcribed in modern Western notation.\n\nThe one thing we can't really get is accuracy, and that's by design: everyone sings it slightly differently.  You can't accurately describe something that's improvised differently every time!  But you can certainly transcribe, *accurately*, a single performance.  It's not even that challenging.  And given that Western music features improvisation as well -- I'm not even talking about jazz; even Bach had improvised cadenzas -- I would not say that Jewish psalms or chanting are alien to Western theory.\n\nExcept for the Yemenites."}, {"comment_id": "en3qsyj", "post_id": "bn9thc", "comment": ">\"Some concepts take real explaining before a person can truly appreciate it\"\n\n\n\nSome is the keyword here.

That's what it's for.  No more, no less.\n\n>He believes that learning music theory would harm his creativity saying that the beatles didn't know any so he doesn't need to.\n\nThis old chestnut.\n\nThe Beatles knew hardly any *music theory jargon.*  They didn't need to - beyond what they needed to communciate with each other, which was very little as *they were all guitarists.*  Not that guitarists are theoretically ignorant, but they can get by working in shapes, with very basic theoretical terms.   There are two famous stories which reveal the extent of their knowledge of jargon.\n\n(1) Paul and George had a favourite chord they called the \"Gretty chord\", after the teacher who showed it to them.  (Yes they had guitar lessons as teenagers.)  The rest of us call it a \"7#9\".  (A lot of guitarists like to call it \"the Hendrix chord\", but that tends to limit it to E7#9, the one Hendrix was famous for.  The Beatles' usage wasn't limited in that way; they knew how to form it on any root.)\n\n(2) Classical critic William Mann identified \"Aeolian cadences\" in their music.  Asked about this (in 1964), a bemused John Lennon said \"they sound like exotic birds.\"\n\nBut of course, they knew exactly how and when to use both 7#9 chords and aeolian cadences.  Why would they need to know the right names?\n\nThe Beatles were *fluent speakers* of the \"language of popular music\", which they had learned almost entirely by ear.  They amassed their knowledge through learning to play 100s of popular and rock'n'roll standards in the five years before they made it big.  What made them stand out - and made them so prolific, successful and \"original\" was that no one else at that time had absorbed such a broad range of influences.   The more you steal, the more original you are.\n\nSo if your friend Bob has learned an equivalent number of songs, from folk to blues to jazz to pop to rock'n'roll to R&B to musical show tunes - then he can compare himself to Lennon/McCartney/Harrison.\n\n>He is quoted in saying \"music should come from the heart\"\n\nYes, but how does it get into the \"heart\" in the first place?   It's a nonsense platitude in any case.   Who would deny it? And it's not the \"heart\" at all - which is an organ designed to pump blood around - it's the brain.  Feelings are in the brain - certainly musical feelings are.  Music has to be fed into the brain to such an extend that its language becomes subconscious.  That's when you can \"play what you feel\" - i.e. without thinking too much about either the technique or the theory.\n\n>I believe that theory would help him understand the music he writes better and could even make him more creative.\n\nWell, that's debatable.  IMO, theory doesn't help you *understand* music - at least not at the deep level it operates in our minds.  It doesn't explain \"why\" anything \"works\".  But it certainly helps you organise the information: the common systems and practices.   Having the names for things helps us think about them.\n\nIt could help you be more creative by offering formulas and sounds you wouldn't otherwise come across.  I.e., it could give you more vocabulary than you might pickup just from copying your favourite music.  The Beatles *might* have been \"more creative\" if they'd read some theory books, but as it was they had more than enough ideas picked up from actual music.\n\nI.e., the Beatles argument is a red herring.  Music theory is for discussing music between musicians.  That's the main reason it would help the two of you in your composing.  A secondary reason would be discovering effects you hadn't heard before."}, {"comment_id": "ergxjc3", "post_id": "c1ubgb", "comment": "you dont need theory to be a good musician, but it is foolish to say it would harm his creativity. he's just being lazy. as the island of our knowledge grows, so does the shores of our our ignorance."}, {"comment_id": "erhg65c", "post_id": "c1ubgb", "comment": "Your friend reminds me of a story I once heard about Mozart.

Someone asks him what key it's in and he says \"G, but it'll be in F for you.\" The Beatles knew basic theory. They didn't have a thorough, nuanced understanding of the inner workings of western harmony, but they knew the names of chords and were definitely able to tell each other what key a song was in.\n\nNow, it is true that a lot of the time, they were fumbling in the dark to some extent. Take, for example, the E7(b9) chord in the song \"I Want to Tell You.\" That wasn't a chord that George knew beforehand and chose to apply when writing the song\u2014he came up with it himself by trying different notes on top of a simpler chord he already knew (E7). But if he hadn't had basic theory to use as a stepping stool, he wouldn't have had nearly as easy access to more complicated harmonies.\n\nI guess the real distinction one could make is that the Beatles didn't learn theory through reading or lectures or whatnot; they learned it intuitively by playing music constantly growing up. It's the difference between learning a foreign language in a classroom and being immersed in a country of people who speak it. People of the latter group might have no clue what a past-participle is, but they are totally capable of using one (just like John Lennon had no clue what an Aeolian cadence was despite him using one in \"Not a Second Time\").\n\nSo yeah, to sum up, having some knowledge of theory is highly important and very common among accomplished musicians.

I think a few things are going on.\n\nFor amateur musicians such as myself, chord progressions have much of the same allure that scales (especially when you call them \"modes\"!) do. In that it *feels like* an easily graspable, self-contained \"thing\" that has expressive value on its own, *prior* to one's actual application of it. In other words, I feel like chord progressions and modes are seen as having intrinsic emotional qualities, which, once you have learned/memorized them, you can now wield as a musician.\n\nTo less experienced musicians who get caught up in the harmony hype, it seems to answer the question \"How do I tap into an interesting emotion, aside from engaging my own creativity and judgement?\" As if, were you to learn the most strikingly beautiful, tastefully complex chord progression that you never hear on the radio, it would automatically translate into Good Music. But it never works like that. Try playing any of the progressions listed in the \"Favorite Chord Progressions\" threads on this sub. To me, they often sound unremarkable, or even clumsy and jarring - because I'm playing them in root position, with a simple voicing, with no attention to rhythm, any no melodic context. It's not the fault of the chord progression! It's all of the missing ingredients in the stew.\n\nI think you often see guitarists get caught up in the mode/scale hype as well, when the player comes to that bit of music theory with the same attitude: \"Here's a cool pattern I can use that will make my playing sound sophisticated and emotional\". The guitarist is free to noodle and run up and down the scale without attention to phrasing, or motifs/riffs, or how it actually applies to a *song* because its assumed that the mode provides value on its own. That the harmonic implication of particularly exotic scale *is* music. Is inherently *better* music than, say, a major scale, or minor pentatonic.\n\nIt's tough. Because at a certain level, certain chord progressions are going to be better at conveying certain feelings because of how they build and release tension. There is absolutely something to a IV-iv-I progression that seems to tug at peoples' heartstrings. But it's only one step in a much larger journey of learning how to express yourself through music. Chord progressions are easy to talk about, easy to understand, and easy to replicate on guitar, keyboard, or your DAW. It's more challenging to communicate about rhythm or timbre, and when we start talking about melody, now we're in the realm of \"other people's original melodic ideas\" which feel harder to take as your own, as we do with chord progressions.\n\nChord progression talk is absolutely over-done, but I don't know what exactly there is to do about it. Except for remind people that, 1) There are so many other elements that contribute to feeling/atmosphere, such as voicing, timbre, dynamics, instrumentation, rhythm, production/effects. 2) Many of your absolute favorite songs are simple four-chorders, so don't mistakenly think that the secret to musical interest is in an uncommon, complex chord progression."}, {"comment_id": "eghai41", "post_id": "aqnqzn", "comment": "Maybe it has to do so much with the prevalence of chord-scale theory as a method of teaching, but lots of people (including myself) forget that melody is king, and rhythm is what moves people.

I put \"analyzing\" in quotes because there's no analysis going on here, just naming stuff.  If I play a song for you with the chords CM7, Am7, Dm7, G7, CM7, I will have played the chord progression I7 - vi7 - ii7 - V7 - I7.  You may think, \"well, who cares?\"  But if you're a beginner at music theory, you don't think that.  You think, \"holy shit, I've *figured it out*!\"  Turning chord symbols into Roman numerals is an accomplishment, and it reduces a bunch of information about melody, key, instrumentation, etc. -- basically the entire piece -- into a small set of atomic numbers that, in a sense, convey meaningful information about the music.\n\nYou can't do that with, say, melody.  To analyze melody, you need to write stuff in music notation (or you have no hope), highlight motifs and transformations, find high and low points, and somehow make all this *meaningful*.  A melodic analysis is an essay question, while a harmonic analysis is (to beginners) a numerical answer.  The fact that you can get some tangible *answer* out of chords means that you can feel accomplished when you do it, plus you feel like you're special for knowing this special language.\n\nHarmony is also the main feature of music theory education in general, so I wouldn't blame just self-taught guitar players.  You learn what intervals are in Chapter 1, then you learn about chord types and Roman numerals, and everything else is just more of those -- all the diatonic triads, all the diatonic 7th chords, harmonic modulations, chromaticism, etc.  It's all about *harmony*.  Most books even teach you that the thing that drives a V7 forward is the tritone, which is... I was going to say not true at all, but it's not *completely* stupid, so... it's misleading at best?  There's a strong impression even in music theory texts and classes that the *main* thing is the study of harmony.\n\nAs you can obviously tell, I don't agree with this at all.  That's why I start [my text](https://www.offtonic.com/theory/index.html) with reading, rhythm, melodic analysis, and only then do I go into intervals and chords, and modes come after *that* and their treatment is almost entirely melodic.  Harmony is *way* overemphasized in the way we usually teach music theory.

But there are some aspects of music theory that can be classified as sort-of-like sciences.\n\nLet me set out some working definitions...\n\n**Hard sciences**, like physics, make observations.  From those observations they form hypotheses, or possible explanations.  A hypothesis should be *falsifiable* \\- you should be able to design an experiment that might disprove your hypothesis.  Then you head to the lab, do that experiment, and you get one of two results: either you disprove the hypothesis, or you don't... and if you don't, that's supporting evidence.  But it's not proof.  Gather enough supporting evidence by testing and disproving possible alternative explanations for your observations and you upgrade the hypothesis to a *theory* \\- that's something that seems to work in every case.\n\nBut that's not what the \"theory\" in music theory means.\n\nOff the top of my head, the only aspect of music theory that approaches hard science is acoustics (which is actually a branch of physics).\n\n**Soft sciences** make observations, and form hypotheses to explain them, but they're not testable.  You can gather data and analyze it, but you can't create an experiment that would falsify your claim.  The best you can do is get statistics on your side, and show that it's a reasonable explanation.  Things like economics and sociology are soft sciences, because you can't really isolate a single variable and test it well.  Within music theory, psychoacoustics pretty well fits the bill for being a soft science.\n\nBut when you think about music theory in general, it doesn't really fit either.\n\nA *taxonomy* is a classification system.  That's what all of basic theory is: we sort things out and name them.  We define what a scale is, or a chord.  We name intervals, and give labels to things like contrary motion.  We build a language that abstracts the sounds so we can sort them and compare them.\n\nIntermediate theory applies those classifications, and sorts out things into general buckets.  We observe what's been done *most of the time* in the masterworks, and we set out general rules: avoid parallel perfect fifths, etc.  But it doesn't \"solve\" things  - virtually all of the masterworks \"break the rules\" in spots.  The rules turn out to be more like guidelines.\n\nBut even at an advanced level, it's subjective.  There can be differing explanations for the \"why\" of what composers did, and for our reactions to them.  It's not a puzzle that can be \"solved\"... it's just a way of describing what's been done."}, {"comment_id": "eu6qxur", "post_id": "cf298u", "comment": "Sorry, that's classified."}, {"comment_id": "eu6tcis", "post_id": "cf298u", "comment": "I mean yeah there are new music theory papers being published all the time.

Music therapy is also making leaps and bounds. New instruments are also being created, lost instruments revived, and existing instruments improved (e.g. F# keys added to saxophones, custom electronically enhanced acoustic instruments, polychromatic keyboards, new taonga p\u016boro).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThere's also some cool stuff going on with expanding our internalisation of concepts that already exist. For example, David Bruce has a cool youtube video out on micro-rhythms, and how we think about and incorporate them into the existing structures of WAM. On the more technological side, stuff like working with machine learning to discover patterns inherent in music that can help us figure out why things sound a certain way or evoke certain emotions. Machines are also helping us tackle creating music remotely, and the psychological effects of latency and visual aids.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think the theory of fusion and understanding non-Western musics is something that still has a long way to go in the Western world, but perhaps that's because our current frameworks for thinking about music aren't best suited for these styles.

Music theory is the former- the formulation of \"rules\" of tonal harmony to describe how music functions within \"common practice\" harmonic systems derived from western classical (using the c word very liberally here) musicians.\n\nAs theory is a descriptive system that attempts to describe music as it is has been already written, it by definition cannot be solved. When a music theorist encounters music deriving from sources outside of the western classical tradition, one great example being the American blues tradition, we quickly see the system breaking down as it attempts to rationalize choices within its specific cultural context. \n\nI really do like the example of the blues here, specifically focusing on the notion of blues harmony. With the blues tradition, we see the use of the dominant 7th tonality used as the I, the home chord of the piece (in addition to the IV and V of course). This is difficult to understand within common practice theory rules, as the dominant 7th is so firmly understood as tension that necessarily tonicizes a key one fifth below it as a resolving function. Yet here, it is actually the tonality that the piece resolves to- even plagally (IV7 to I7 in the standard blues turnaround), another example of \"rules breaking\". \n\nAll this is to say that while music theory is certainly pursued with the goal of becoming an exhaustive system of describing how music functions, it necessarily proceeds from the music, and not the other way around. In this sense then, it becomes apparent that MT can never become a solved system, as the core principles of functional harmony that music theory in the western world is predicated upon do not contain within them the possibly to generate every single harmonic phenomena one may encounter within the world of music at large. \n\nThis is not to say that lab work does not exist however, and that there is no one out there following concepts to their logical conclusions. I find myself thinking of neural networks trained on common practice rules for counterpoint composition for example, or folks studying and theorizing about the origins of the notion of consonance as linked to the harmonic series of a note, and how the conclusions they draw affect our understanding of tuning systems.

Just like drawing is 90% looking, music is 90% listening, and the listening/looking part is where you get your data from.We use physical instruments to figure out the rules of the physical world, but never before only very recently did we have the power to directly measure how something makes people feel. The only tools we had to measure this was to listen to other people's reaction, and feel your own reaction. Musicians and artists have been doing this forever, and I consider it a form of science, just like how trying out jokes at a stand up set is a form of science, answering the question \"is this funny?\" with an actual experiment. Professional comedians get a large sample size by going to many clubs. Sure, it's not a double blind study, because the researcher in this case  is very bias in favor of the experiment succeeding most of the time... But there is anecdotal evidence of comedians purposefully doing badly in order to \"clean the room\" to try out new jokes on a hostile crowd, which is an example of a good scientific method.This is the science of what appeals to people or the science of qualitative things. The study of qualia perhaps. The study of the quality of experiences.\n\nI'm sure this isn't the answer you're looking for. You want to hear about waveforms and their interactions with each other... but it doesn't really matter what physical properties the music has necessarily, what is more important is the meaning of it and how people react to it, including yourself. Why do different cultures have different musical tastes and scales? why is music constantly changing and reinventing itself and repeating and why is a sound loved one day and hated the next? There are articles in psychological journals answering questions like this all the time... But my point is that every musician is a scientist of sorts, some are better than others, and the best are probably those who came to an understanding of music theory without being explicitly taught it, just through the personal exploration and study of sound."}, {"comment_id": "eu8lfxi", "post_id": "cf298u", "comment": "\"Experiments in labs\" is in the realm of Music Cognition.

So, to measure what we are talking about, we have to discuss Barks. Barks are essentially a frequency scale on which equal distances correspond with perceptually equal distances. Above about 500 Hz this scale is more or less equal to a logarithmic frequency axis. Below 500 Hz the Bark scale becomes more and more linear. The scale ranges from 1 to 24 and corresponds to the first 24 critical bands of hearing. To convert a frequency into Barks, we utilize the equation:\n\nBark= 13arctan(0.00076(f))+3.5 arctan((f/7500)^2) where f is the frequency. \n\nSo if we have a frequency of 261.626 Hz, which corresponds to the Equally Tempered note C4, that would correspond to:\n\n13arctan(0.00076(261.626))+3.5arctan((261.626/7500)^2) = 2.975 Barks\n\nTo find Critical Band Rate, you utilize the equation:\n\n((26.81(f))/(1960+f)-0.53\n\nUtilizing the same frequency, you get\n\n((26.81(2616.626))/(1960+261.626)-0.53=2.627 Barks\n\nFinally, to find critical bandwidth, you use this equation;\n\n6sinh^-1(f/600)\n\n\nUtilizing the same frequency, we get \n\n6sinh^-1(261.626/600)= 2.539 Barks. \n\nUtilizing [this](https://m.imgur.com/a/6XUWC4n) table will show you the required information. \n\nSo if you have another frequency that is within the same critical band, more than likely it will be considered dissonant, due to the beats, as well as issues like difference and summation tones."}, {"comment_id": "eu9pefd", "post_id": "cf298u", "comment": "Jacob Collier has been experimenting with microtones for years.
