Beethoven didn't learn music theory without ear training.  *Nobody* does, except perhaps some self-taught dabblers who learn teach themselves from books without listening to examples and internalizing them.

That is supposed to mean something like: music theory describes how music works but it is not supposed to tell us how music *should* or *must* be.\n\nHowever, music theory does not merely describe music. It describes *good* music--or, at least, musical features that are in some way aesthetically valuable. \n\nThat means  it also prescribes:    if you want to make good music, do such-and-such and avoid such-and-such.\n\nWe don't craft music theory around mediocre or bad music--we don't seek to theorize the harmonic structure of that stuff. (Or if we do it's only to understand what to avoid.) The whole point of music theory is to explain what is good in music.\n\nThis makes me a traditionalist, I know. Much of the history of music theory is an attempt to explain what makes amazing music amazing. Why is J.S. Bach's work so good? How can we tell whether this is Bach or some amateurish rip off? \n\n\nSome people are saying that there will be exceptions to theories that we develop, and that if this happens then we should go with our gut and reject the theory. I agree with all of that--all of that just proves that we haven't  discovered the correct theory yet. It doesn't prove that there's no such thing as \"correct\" music anymore than disproving a theory in physics proves that there's no such thing as \"correct\" physics.\n\nI'm not saying that composers should consciously try to follow music theory. That would be a huge mistake for many reasons. For one thing, contemporary music theory is probably wrong. We haven't figured out how good music works yet or even what good music is. So music based on contemporary theory will suck. (Hindemith anyone?) Second, even if we did have a true theory of good music, it would be really distracting to write music based on it--kind of like how it's really distracting for athletes to think consciously about which muscles they should flex while they're trying to play. Third, it's not necessary to know a theory in order to do what the theory says to do. I don't know anything about linguistics or the physiology of how the brain produces sentences that come out of my keyboard--but I don't *need* to know that stuff in order to write sentences on reddit.\n\nFinally, some people say that theory can't be like a \"law\" because music is about feelings, and if you like how something sounds/feels then you should just go with it. But there can be a law of feelings--that is, there can be a theory that is based on how our feelings work. That, in my opinion, is what the true music theory will tell us: the laws of how sound reliably produces feelings. \n\nOnce we develop these laws, we'll be able (in theory) to make a computer algorithm that makes perfect music.

I'm not saying to give everybody a hippie answer. From my angle, it seems as if though there were some people that could benefit from hearing it, as I did. I'm not coming at theory... My rut was years ago, I love theory. I nerd out over harmony 24/7.\n\nIt's just that if someone is writing a song for the sake of self expression and asks \"can I play X chord in this progression?\" there shouldn't be any \"Ehh I wouldn't just play [common 'functional' move] to get there, it resolves better\" or anything. That stifles creativity. For those of us who are comfortable using and applying theory, we know we can get anywhere by using/\"abusing\" certain techniques (inversions, voicings, melody, tonic systems, voice leading, etc) so why don't we help them creatively and musically arrive at their chosen destination, as opposed to sending them down our own path? I mean I guess that's how people work by default, only seeing their route in life so all of their advice only really correlates to their experience, but we owe it to ourselves to grow out of that and use our knowledge and tools for the \"creative good\" so to speak. Not rewrite music already written. \n\nAnd I don't agree with \"you gotta learn the rules to break the rules\", there are simply no rules. Yes, there are laws of physics that govern how we hear sound. And of course there are known techniques that achieve generally 'desirable' results, but they aren't rules. There are no rules to break. Neither Beethoven nor Hendrix nor Coltrane nor Bach were following/breaking rules, they were just writing music. They all had varying levels of knowledge of theory but all managed to write music that was thoroughly expressed their \"uniqueness\" as people. To me, we all have the potential to reach the level they did if we free our minds from systems. I'm NOT saying not to utilize systems and known strategies!\n\nAll I'm saying is that it is beneficial to creativity to think of theory systems in the same way we think of chords or notes.
