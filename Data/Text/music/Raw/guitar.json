People stopped using it because of the shitty advertisements and so, as a response to losing ad revenue, they've gotten more hardcore with ads. \n\nIf anyone from Ultimate-Guitar reads this, here's some advice from a web developer: users don't like intrusive ads. Your product is your user base, which you sell to advertisers. No product, no sales. Of course, you also rely on your users being willing participants. Fortunately for us, unfortunately for you, we have tools like AdBlock Plus with which we can negate intrusive ads. That said, this is used as a mechanism to protect our computers and ourselves against the aggressive, and frankly offensive, methods by which you've chosen to advertise to us. Fortunately for you, though, AdBlock Plus offers [a list of criteria that ads must meet to not be blocked by ABP.](https://adblockplus.org/en/acceptable-ads#criteria) This isn't actually a difficult set of rules to meet, or unreasonable. You are welcome to sell my page hits to advertisers if you meet the above criteria with your ads. Otherwise, though, I do not consent to being sold and so your advertisements will not reach me in any manner you could legally undertake."}, {"comment_id": "cmnzhak", "post_id": "2ok4kh", "comment": "All good points, however I can tell you that they don't give 2 bits what you think"}, {"comment_id": "cmo7x8u", "post_id": "2ok4kh", "comment": "It's got an active forum community.

Getting those down and really made the triad shapes come alive and not be just some pattern to memorize. \n\nAnd something that *really* helped: Shakedown Street. That opening D minor is very familiar, but when we barred the A on the E string along with it the 'right' sound just popped out of our guitars. Felt sooo good.

So we all went up there on one of our breaks and the dude was so fucking cool and so jacked to show is all the shit he\u2019s worked on over the years. \n\nHe converts tapes to digital files. One of the many records he converted was Zeppelin II. If you\u2019ve ever listened to that record digitally in literally any way, you have him to thank. \n\nAs we were all gazing around the room at all the amazing shit he\u2019s been involved with, he asked \u201cyou guys wanna hear what I\u2019m workin on now?!\u201d \n\nLike we\u2019re gonna say no to that right? \n\nSo he rewinds a bit and says \u201clemme get back to this one spot I know you guys will love\u201d then presses play... and Jimi goddamn Hendrix starts playing and singing on some jam and is ripping some solo... \n\nWe\u2019re all legit looking at each other wide eyed knowing that this has probably only ever been heard by just the crew that tracked plus a couple others... my buddy who is a huge Jimi fan had tears in his eyes. \n\nSo Jimi is slaying and we\u2019re taking it all in when all the sudden during his solo you hear a little whiff followed by \u201cAhh fuckin hell I broke a string\u201d and we all lose our shit hahaha. \n\nThe guy was so excited to share that with us and we were so honored to experience it with him and together. What a job that guy has.

It was an amazing once in a lifetime experience and I\u2019m glad you all appreciate! Also the shroom trip was great and I wrote two songs haha.\n\nEdit 2: The guy that showed us the tapes is named Dan Johnson (@dan_audioarchiving on Instagram) for anyone interested. I wrote him and asked where/how to hear the sessions and he replied: \n\n\u201cHey Josh!  Thanks for the kind words.  I do remember you, and I'm glad you liked the tour.

I'd listened to classic rock on the radio but there's something special about plugging in an 8-track and hearing that warm analog goodness.

It's (AFAIK) where they'll get the most eyes. I think UG still has a much bigger userbase than Songsterr and other tab sites.\n2. I get credit for my submissions. All my tabs are fairly visibly attributed to me, whereas it's pretty buried in Songsterr.\n3. I can choose to prevent edits to my tabs. I got into uploading my transcriptions because I was dissatisfied (to put it lightly) with the horrendous Guitar Pro tabs on the interwebz. The last thing I want to do is cede editorial power to the same randos that were the reason I got into making tabs in the first place. Songsterr is all about being a \"wiki\" of guitar tabs, so they're always editable. Considering how subjective ear training can be, there is no way in hell I trust that given enough edits, people, and time, we will converge on \"the truth\" in a guitar tab. TL;DR I don't like Songsterr's edit model.\n4. Ultimate Guitar lets you download the source Guitar Pro files, which are the **only** way I recommend anyone use my tabs because all of the browser tab players out there are terrible.

"}, {"comment_id": "d4icby2", "post_id": "4p24i2", "comment": "No, nothing to worry about, won't hurt anything. Regardless of what effects you plug in, it's still the same analog signal that gets sent to the amplifier.  You can see this with a voltmeter if you're interested. Hook the leads to the patch cable that you'd normally plug into the jack on the amp, and experiment. It's just an analog signal until it hits the amplifier, nothing more. At least not with any effects pedal I've ever used (distortion, flanger, chorus, echo, etc). Most of the distortion pedals work by overdriving the signal with their own internal circuitry that causes the signal to sort of \"square\" off the top/bottom of the amplitude, which is what makes it sound fuzzy and distorted, but the signal going to the amp doesn't increase in voltage or anything like that.  I'm an engineer, but this isn't my area of expertise, so my apologies if the details are a bit off. Again - check it with a voltmeter. Touch one lead to the tip, the other to the shaft below the collar, and set it to DC. You may see a slight variance due to added resistance when you turn pedals on and off, but it should stay relatively the same.  I have an old tube head that I've been using since the 80's, never had an issue, have never had to replace any tubes (mine uses GE-6L6's). I do notice differences in sound when changing the order of the pedals. For example, I like to put my distortion in front of an old analog Morley wah-wah. It just sounds better when it's in front as opposed to behind.  That's probably because the wah-wah is from the 70's and 100% analog. Most stuff these days are digital. The old wah-wah is essentially a tone pot with a light-absorbing potentiometer. There's a flap of black felt that covers or uncovers its lens as you operate the pedal. That in turn operates the tone lot. Pretty ingenious, really.   "}, {"comment_id": "d4ikn5g", "post_id": "4p24i2", "comment": "Thank you for the technical answer.

At the very least it probably needs a set up. Don't overlook this as a poorly set up guitar will discourage you. \n\nMake sure the stings are light enough to fret without too much discomfort, but heavy enough to move the top. I use 12 gauge on my working guitars and 13's on my practice stuff. What I mean by move the top (if you don't know) is the soundboard. The top of your acoustic is a soundboard. The strings vibrate the board and the vibrations are amplified in the chamber by the board. If you strings are too light it'll take more effort to get the top \"moving\" or vibrating in a way that produces a round tone. \n\nNext, learn 5 chords. C A G E D (learn the G with your pinky on the G and ring on the D, it just sounds better). Practice switching between them, making sure not to lift your fingers off the board more than you need to. In other words, don't let your fingers fly up in the air when you switch chords. Its VITAL that you practice this way from  the very start. I can;t tell you how many guys that have been playing for decades come to me because their poor finger posture has put an artificial cap on their playing.

Experiment with holding the pick sideways and hitting the strings with the round/fat part and see if it makes playing faster and see how it changes the tone when there is more pick in contact with the strings. The less the pick digs in between the strings, the quicker you can be running fast-picking leads. \n\nAlso, think about picking technique. Some great teachers recommend *always* alternating pick strokes; others say that you alternate except when you change strings in which case you want to pick in the direction of the new string. So, going down from, say, the G string to the B string you would use a downward stroke. \n\nAs far as standing posture goes, notice that the higher you hold the guitar, the easier it is to get around the neck. That's why you see so many hipsters rejecting the rock-n-roll stance of keeping the guitar as low as possible. Yes, it does look more cool, but it limits your speed. Of course, longer arms is going to mean more comfort and ease when you wear it low, but it's still a trade-off between looking cool and utilizing better technique. \n\nedit: grammar/typos"}, {"comment_id": "cjoa9w5", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Woah!  \nI never knew ANY of these things!

Have them check out your instrument and see is it needs work. It's usually not much, some filing on the bridge or nut, and perhaps a neck adjustment. However, I've seen many guitars that cannot play well because the bridge is in the wrong location. You can tune it fine, but if the bridge is too close to the nut, notes further up the neck will sound sharp, too far away and they will sound flat. I worked in a music store back in the day, and a guy brought in these beautiful expensive looking instruments, at a very low cost, but we turned him away because the bridges were placed wrong. \n\n2) New strings. Strings that have gunk on them or have blackened will not vibrate evenly, and you will not get good intonation. You'll want a combo peg winder and pin puller to change strings. I got one that also has a string cutter built in. It's worth it.\n\n3) Tuner. The clip on tuners are okay, but you'll become a much better player if you learn to tune trusting your ears for the final adjustments. Even a well formed chord can sound wrong if your tuning is off. You should be able to do E and A forms up the neck (3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th frets, for example) and have it sound good.\n\n4) Now the good news is that there's a ton of free TABs available online, and chord charts, and videos that will help you learn, in just about any style that might appeal.\n\n5) Now the bad news. It's a lot of work, and your fingers will hurt. A lot. You'll learn to like that.\n\n6) Learn songs. THE WHOLE SONG, EVERY TIME. Not just the fun bits. Not just the bits that are easy to play, but sound cool. Learn the whole dang song. This will make jamming with other folks a lot more fun. (Oh -  and sing if you've got it.)\n\n7) If you start to loose interest, shake it up. Get a capo and explore with it on the 3rd Fret. (Lots of Jethro Tull 'round there, but Mother Goose is on the 5th. You'll find John Barleycorn on the 7th, with Hotel California)\n\n8) If that gets old, try alternate tunings. It's a great way to teach you fingers NOT to automatically go for the standard chord forms.\n\nHave fun."}, {"comment_id": "cjodxe7", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "I actually don't know anybody who plays a guitar  haha.  \nThank you for friendly advice, saved and noted :)."}, {"comment_id": "cjodzys", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Well, I'm way too late for the easy joke, aren't I?"}, {"comment_id": "cjoeg8d", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Maybe, maybe not."}, {"comment_id": "cjog15c", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Justinguitar is easilly the best I've found.
