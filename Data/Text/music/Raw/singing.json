You guys can also be in fact ACTUAL TENORS who also have yet to: mature, sing and train enough (vocal development is complete from 25-30 years old)\n\nDuring two years, I spent six months of training until now as a 21 years old to discover that I was not even a \u00ab\u00a0Low Tenor\u00a0\u00bb. I\u2019m a light Tenor like most young Tenor voices. And that revelation is proven by my REAL passagio (F4/F#4) which took me those six months to discover. \n\nA lot of you haven\u2019t even taken a vocal lesson and then when you break at D#4, you go into the \u00ab\u00a0Baritone Curse\u00a0\u00bb depression mode when you don\u2019t even know how your voice functions and where you lie technically. Some of you like to talk about your \u00ab\u00a0supported\u00a0\u00bb Baritone F#4 and A2 but nah, that\u2019s just you trying to fool yourself, thinking that one month of practice is already enough to strengthen support. And trust me, I LIVED THROUGH THAT PHASE, I know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nAs for the real Baritones, look at Countertenor singers singing operas of the XVIIIth century, they\u2019re MOSTLY BARITONES. The arias they perform are often filled with passages that showcase castrati\u2019s virtuosity: extremely fast and extended runs, high notes jumping all over the place, etc... such difficulty, yet so many Countertenors are riding those phrases with relative ease. That take some years of training from your chest to head register. I only know of two professional Countertenors who are naturally Tenors. \n\nMen\u2019s voices are generally the same when it comes to speaking. Chest dominant and tend to go towards the Baritone colour and range. When you sing, it\u2019s a different story. Not only you sing differently than you talk, but Tenors (SHOULD) use a different, lighter approach than lower voices to reach their high notes. They have a smaller voice, so we can\u2019t really bring our modal voice from G4 to C5 without using some covering, even if we can sing higher than you naturally. Speaking about singing higher, I\u2019ve met some really heady Baritones and some really thick Tenor voices that may confuse the inexperienced listener. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to use your head voice (falsetto, mixed voice are in the same category for us classical vocalists). Lower voices have a better extension in the head voice than Tenors do. Sing in a way that\u2019s comfortable for you. Don\u2019t rush. Good results will come. You just need to be patient. And DON\u2019T BE OBSESSED with voice types, ESPECIALLY FACH which has nothing to do with you if you don\u2019t sing operas from Rossini to Romanticism (from Baroque to early Classicism, it\u2019s almost exclusively Lyric Tenors)"}, {"comment_id": "exhblep", "post_id": "cswgzd", "comment": "Laughs in soprano.

In choir, I was classified as tenor one for 7 years in a row just because of my falsetto. But my chest voice isn't anywhere high enough to be tenor 1, it's not strong on E4/Eb4 (which tenor 2s mostly sing ), and it's not low enough for baritone or tenor 2. My range has been like this for the past 3 years (except for my falsetto going away). What should I do? It would be awesome to be a bass but I don't think that will happen simply because I don't have the range. But I can't get to notes higher than D4 without straining/ flipping.

Having a good song written\n2. Having a cool, interesting sounding voice\n3. Being able to sing relatively on pitch - ish. Just has to be close enough\n4. Being able to sing on the right rhythms\n5.

Being an actual really good singer \n\n\n\nNow I know a lot of you are not in hip hop, nor are trying to be a professional artist.

That was the world this book was written in. Students would meet their teacher many times per week. Sometimes they even lived with their teacher as an apprentice. A lesson would last only as long as appropriate. \n\nFor example, Marchesi (slightly later than Lamperti) wrote that no teacher would give a lesson longer than a half hour to a beginning student. \n\nThis was also a world where the student didn\u2019t have choirs, school musicals, music camps, YouTube, karaoke....mostly they got their music either from the church or from their teacher. An age where people studying music would have also most likely been instructed in piano and solfege in addition to singing as a matter of fact. It was also a time where singing in this manner would have been geared almost exclusively for \u201celite\u201d singing - Ie: opera. \n\nI\u2019ve found that in this day and age if you try this approach, you just make a student who is scared to make any sounds. Students also tend to lack sufficient music education, but have the ability to consume music to their hearts content outside of lessons. It makes it hard to foster an interest in singing and technique unless you can meet them and work out how to best serve their goals. \n\nI\u2019ve had a few students who I\u2019ve been able to take this approach with who are essentially being \u201crehabbed\u201d. They\u2019ve come with a technique that isn\u2019t serving them anymore and the easiest thing to do is spend a few months on vocalizes, cut out all performing and rehearsing, and then slowly add repertoire back in.

Technique should help you improve and control aspects of your voice that you need to sing songs, not enslave you to them. \n\nApplies to the piano also, if you want to play piano, then the most important thing you need is indeed not passion, but it's not some rules on what you should study first either.

Even as someone with classical training, I know that my teacher is a lot less pedagogical than some and frankly I don't find the heavily pedagogical explanations given to be terrible useful. On the other hand, it can often take a little while of listening to someone sing in a particular register to figure out what their issue(s) is(are), and so a lot of this \"hey, here's a clip of me singing, please critique\" stuff, even when it isn't a coded \"hey, please tell me I'm good at this\" post, is straight up not easy to comment on. Perhaps the person in question sings too far forward, but perhaps telling them that will make them stick their tongue in the back of their mouth or something. Maybe they could work on their breath support - that's pretty generalized advice that's probably good for any beginning or intermediate singer - but TBH I also see people, especially when they're starting out, concentrate way too hard on what their belly is doing at the expense of allowing themselves to do bad things with their throat, which is really the #1 important part.\n\nThe truth is, singing involves doing a lot of things at once, and this isn't advice that's easy to give to people. The human body is cool about this in that once you've gotten one of these things \"down\" you can just allow yourself to do it unconsciously but there's a transitional period where you have to train that behavior in. That's just not a particularly easy thing to convey in a forum like Reddit, nor is it the kind of thing that Redditors want to hear at all.\n\ntl;dr: the issue, I think, is not with the particular sub.

You're clearly putting effort into your lessons and progressing, so well done.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nYou raise an interesting point for those of us who are vocal coaches... I've been teaching singing since 2005 and one of the most common issues that I encounter is lack of confidence, especially in adult students. Maybe somebody made a nasty remark when they were at school, or their mother told them to be quiet all the time... so it's part of my job to help people feel confident and to let them discover what their voice can do. On the other hand, I have to be 100% honest with my praise because I can't have people go out and gig and tell people I teach them if they don't sound good. So, if your vocal coach says it's going well, it's going well.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI'm sorry you don't feel supported by friends and girlfriends... it sounds like it's something important to you and that your nearest and dearest don't get that it's a big deal... maybe they just think you know it's going well. Hell, I've been a signed singer and songwriter for decades. It's what pays my bills and sometimes my mother listens to tracks I've caught 4 planes to write and says 'do people really listen to this sort of thing?', so just remember that although we do want our circle to be supportive, the opinions that matter the most are the **informed opinions**. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nI used to work in A&R so if you want to send me a recording for honest feedback on where you're at if you're aiming for a professional career, I'd be more than happy to listen to you and give a few tips.

I'm not the best at breathing perfectly but within the scope of my breathing skill, making great sound and great notes is not a difficult thing. The idea is to relax.

I like to do a lot of karaoke as its really the only time aside from my lessons where I get to sing with a microphone and it's really easy to get caught up in the moment and sing way harder than you need to. You might still nail the song to an outside observer, but it absolutely takes a toll on your voice. I used to wear out and fatigue super quick.

Im a baritone and I have felt this struggle! For me the first place to check for fixing tone is fixing support, so make sure you're breathing deep and actively engaging the muscles you need in your core to retain the breath.\n\nBUT the fun and experimental part that'll give you the difference in tone, is just playing around. Pick easy baritone songs (theres thousands) where you have the option to play with the vowel you're singing on. Like \"Fly Me to the Moon\", for example, you can sing \"Fly\" in the speak singy (but still supporting) diphthong of the 'y' in \"fly\" or you can make it more open and hold on to the 'ah' in the diphthong. \"Flah-eeh me to the moon\". And then theres \"moon\" which you can keep small or modify into a small 'oh' sound as you would if it were higher.\n\nAlso! LOW VOICED DUDES! (If you lower it for low notes, it\u2019s gonna go higher for high notes \ud83d\udc40)don't lower your larynx for low notes! It'll make your tone breathy. Add the slightest bit of nasality to keep a bright \"forward\" sound. Hell, go over the top with the nasality to feel what that feels like, then reel it back to a pleasant tone.\n\nYou really just have to explore you're own voice. There is no such thing as a bad sound, except those that hurt/involve strain.\n\nBut yeah bring some nasality down and connect your bottom registers together."}, {"comment_id": "f5nftin", "post_id": "do86ww", "comment": "Different techniques will help you modify and manipulate the color of your voice.

My teacher does the city men\u2019s choir and has doctorates in several musical areas so I definitely trust her background. \n\nI always thought I sang high for what I read on the internet for types of singers.\nThe first real time I sang warm ups and scales she said you\u2019re easily a bass baritone just with a high range. She would keep me within F2-F#4 with E4-F4 being very good powerful notes. She had me sing songs like Edelweiss and Red River Valley to match my speak voice. She said they sounded beautiful but I hated how I sounded because it just didn\u2019t have that fun, that energy, or the work required to sing them. She didn\u2019t want me singing a song like You Raise Me Up since I wasn\u2019t ready for the A4 yet and would always go sharp. \n\nI\u2019ve come to terms that while I can hit A4-C5 with mostly chest they won\u2019t sound good for a while and I don\u2019t want to sing much below the 3rd octave. I really do find that is it\u2019s a song you generally enjoy singing and it\u2019s in your range then you\u2019ll sound alright at least. A song like Ashes by Celine Dion has a chorus that gives me chills when I hit it, but I know when I sing High Hopes by Panic at the disco I\u2019m definitely lacking the vocal quality. \n\n I hope this might help you a little bit. I did find that experimenting with the brightness and darkness of my sound helped as well as practicing certain compression and vowel changes.

How much of that is from learning to sing vs. aging? Hard to say.\n\nOne thing I'll caution: don't try and color your voice too much. I used to dry and darken my tone to sound like a big manly man. Once I started recording myself from time to time it became obvious how silly it sounded compared to singing 'naturally'. Keep improving your technique. Keep an open mind. Maybe your voice won't be exactly what you want it to be, but that doesn't mean it won't be beautiful in a different way.\n\nAlso wanted to add regarding range: I've never seen huge improvements working on range itself. My range improvements have consistently come from improving my technique in the middle registers. As opposed to pushing the boundaries, if that makes sense.

If you keep doing it long enough, it will sink into your brain and your opinion will become a fact to you. You will become like me and grow to loathe the act of singing lol. \n\nAs many have said before me, your perception of your sound coming out of your body is not what actually exists in reality, in the same way that listening to a recording of yourself sounds weird and uncomfortable (Is that how I sound?!). Only your teacher and recordings (to an extent) will have any validity when it comes to your sound. You have too much bodily involvement to actually physically hear what you truly sound like in the moment. Your sound resonates in your body, mostly the bones in your face/head, and your ears are too close to all of these moving parts to have an unaffected opinion (like how you can still hear yourself when closing your ears).\n\nAlso, you're 17. Your voice is going to be going through some wild changes until your 30s. Look at the participants of \"Young artist\" competitions and programs for vocalists, they're all basically in their late 20s and early 30s. So you're stuck with whatever sound you've got and the only thing you can do is focus on improving technique and FORCING yourself to LIKE your sound or to IGNORE it all together and try to have a good time lol."}, {"comment_id": "f5ouz7p", "post_id": "do86ww", "comment": "I feel like i might get crucified for saying this here but what the hell.\n\nI really struggled with my own voice.  Hated the sound, the tonality, figured my range sucked.  I'm a guitarist and my first (covers) band had me attempting all sorts of stuff that was way outside my comfort zone.  Whatever, it was just a means to an end, right?  \n\nThen one day, just for fun, I tried consciously mimicing singers:  Bowie and Brian May initially.  It was really odd.  I found that I could be utterly convincing... because it wasn't 'me' any more.  I studied the way they approached different words/sounds and figured out that I could reproduce that.  So that was the first step.  It gave me the confidence to know that I could sound okay.  Then my focus shifted.  I gradually found other artists that fit my range better. George Harrison comes to mind.  Most recently, I've been on a Clapton thing (Layla, Tears in Heaven.)\n\nNo, I don't want to start a Weird Al cover band.  I'm not planning on starting a Neil Young or Dylan tribute either.  But the exercise has been absolutely invaluable in proving to myself that my voice isn't inherently a problem, and that it can sound good.  A huge part of this was training myself to lose my speaking voice.  Singing with an obvious Aussie accent isn't pretty, and I've broken myself of that habit.  I'm developing a toolbox of techniques, a way to neutralise the things that I find most objectionable about my voice.\n\nAnd the focus on mimickry has also changed other things somewhat unexpectedly.  The very first word that Jeff Lynne sings in Can't Get It Out of my Head is 'midnight' and there is no way that I can sing it the way he does it without sounding corny. So I accept that and change the emphasis and suddenly it works for me.  So in copying him, I'm nevertheless having to do things my way regardless.   It's an easy next step to tone down those qualities that make it an obvious copy.  I'm not going to sing with an obvious cockney  accent unless I'm doing it for effect ('allo guvnuh') but at the same time I'll absolutely be aware of that accent.\n\nElsewhere someone spoke about your speaking voice and someone else spoke about 'acting' and they are both spot on.   Play a part when you sing.  It doesn't need to be a different individual,  maybe just a different version of you.  \n\nBut diversity is the key.  If there's a couple of singers you desperately aspire to emulating or a particular style you might be out of luck.  Maybe you really want the grit and weight of Tom Waits but you actually have Freddie Mercury's vocal chords?   \n\nI'm hopelessly unqualified to give advice re technique but i do know that consciously copying singers has led me to a completely different relationship with my own voice."}, {"comment_id": "f28w3u6", "post_id": "dcl6ac", "comment": "Thanks for posting to r/singing! **Be sure to check [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/wiki/index)** to see if any questions you might have have already been answered!

Is it related to resonance or we\u2019re talking about another issue in that regard (compression/belting etc)?"}, {"comment_id": "e8hn6k9", "post_id": "9rj5ic", "comment": "Awesome that you made progress, however what you're describing is not quite how it works. u/pcstagner is close but still not quite correct.\n\nFair warning: It's almost unavoidable to use a bit of technical language, but I've tried to explain the terms I used as best I could. Even so, this will probably be a tough read.\n\nThe fundamental frequency or pitch of your singing is determined at the laryngeal level. Specifically, you have two primary ways of increasing pitch. One is to stretch the vocal cords by contracting the cricoarytenoid muscle and another is to raise the subglottal pressure, which will also raise the loudness.\n\nPitch however isn't everything there is to the voice. The vocal tract also has resonant frequencies, called formants, and these are important to determining the timbral quality of your voice. When you raise the larynx, for example, you shorten the vocal tract and raise the formants. The exact relationship between the formants and your vocal tract is fairly complicated and it is modified further by your oral cavity, whether you paranasalize the resonance, whether you have nasal airflow (since that reduces interoral pressure) etc. Basically it's pretty complicated.\n\nAnyway, we recognize vowels based on the first and second formant primarily - that is, the two formants with the lowest pitch, also referred to as F1 and F2 respectively. Fronted vowels (like 'ee', 'ay', etc) have a high second formant whereas back vowels (like 'oo', 'uh', etc) have a low second formant. Open vowels (like 'ah', 'ay', 'uh', etc) have a high first formant, whereas closed vowels (like 'ee', 'oo', etc) have a low first formant. The international phonetics association has a chart over the vowels and their formants.\n\nNow, formants, being resonances, can only amplify existing frequencies created by the voice. If you're familiar with acoustics, then you probably know about overtones - essentially periodic vibrations that occur at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. These are what get amplified. When you sing a low pitch, the overtones will be close together so a single formant can amplify rather a lot of them, but when you go higher, they spread out more. With open vowels, you'll often have the first formant amplifying the first overtone - also called the second harmonic or H2. We call this F1-H2 coupling.\n\nWith beginners in particular, there'll be an instinct to raise the formant as the pitch goes up. This slightly distorts the vowel, and at some point you'll get so high that the formant cannot be raised further without drastically changing the sound of the vowel. We call this the passaggio. When reaching this point, you'll instead want to allow the first formant to drop beneath the second harmonic, causing a perceptible timbral shift that sounds like a kind of tipping of the vowel and is classically called 'covering', however this can take some training to do and many people will instinctively change registers into falsetto at this point (because falsetto naturally goes well with F1-H1 coupling whereas full register naturally goes well with F1-H2 coupling, but either registration can be used with either coupling as well as other couplings I have not discussed) Now, if you do not do this, there'll come a point where you simply cannot raise the formant any higher and where you'll either struggle to go any higher in pitch or you'll have the same kind of tipping of the vowel but much less deliberate and controlled. It may even cause you to change registers, but even if it doesn't, it can give a kind of cracking sound.\n\nNow, to facilitate covering the vowel, you don't want a sudden shift from F1-H2 coupling to F1-H1 coupling. Instead, a while before approaching the passaggio, you'll want to allow the second harmonic to raise somewhat above the first formant, without quite switching to F1-H1 coupling just yet. There are people who call this quality 'mixed voice' and the covered quality 'head voice', but both of those terms are used in many different and conflicting ways. Mixed voice in this sense, for example, is not what you'd use for high notes in your full register, that'd be head voice, whereas in more contemporary genres, mixing is used to refer to light belting. For that reason I prefer to talk about formant and harmonic coupling.\n\nPinging you u/AlrightyAlmighty since you seemed interested in the topic. If you're looking for resources to learn more then I am very sorry to tell you that it is very difficult to find good accessible resources and that my own understanding of the topic comes largely from reading journal publications I found on google scholar, from studying spectrograms, and from a blog called [singwise.com](https://singwise.com), which I recommend because it is better and more reliable than most resources I've found, though still not perfect and I would still recommend that you verify everything second hand, including the things I've said."}, {"comment_id": "e8he9qe", "post_id": "9rj5ic", "comment": "The thing that\u2019s been confusing to me is that singers like Bon Jovi always *sound* very chest-y and connected even when they sing at the top of their range.

Sound is made in the vocal tract, and your lungs are full of wet bloody sponge. imagine a chest full of soundproofing foam and that\u2019s not far off the mark. Even your sinuses have very little effect on the sound, other than sprinkling it a bit of unique identifiers (everyone sounds the same with a bad cold, and you don\u2019t sound like yourself to yourself) \n\nAnd relative to the pitch, the higher you sing the lower you want the peaks in the timbre to be.   High pitched peaks on top of a high pitched sound is what people generally call \u201cnasal\u201d.  But if you take that same profile and present it at a lower pitch, it now sounds ok.  \n\n\nWhere your model of the vocal tract is failing you is that you\u2019re confusing it with a guitar or a bell. In fact it works completely differently - the partial obstruction of  the tongue causes a standing wave. \n\n\nThe overall length of the tube contributes to the lowest overtones, the mouth opening to the next set, and the tongue arch relative to the palate creates another.   Measuring these distances yields results that correspond mathematically to the peak areas seen in a spectrograph.  \n\n\nAcoustic efficiency is when these elements line up to create the desired psycho-acoustic effect using lower than previously achievable energy input. \n\nIf you want to more easily visualize your sound and see what does what, I recommend the iOS app called [spectroreal](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/spectro-real/id808286812?mt=8) .  Start by listening to random sounds and trying to predict how they will appear in the graph. \n\n\nHTH\n\n\nEdit - you may be asking now, if it\u2019s just a wave in a tube, why aren\u2019t there wave in a tube musical instruments with adjustable length tubes?

Usually, if you want to develop good technique, learning \"from the ground up\", you go to a voice teacher. A vocal coach on the other hand will work with you through the songs you're singing and try to better the performance with subtle changes that are usually easy to do. They may also help you develop y our technique, but ultimately the focus is on each individual song, and anything you're taught is for that end. With voice teachers, it's the other way around, with the songs being chosen (often by them) specifically to develop your voice.\n\nVoice teachers looking to critique somebody's voice will be interested in, as much as possible, an authentic representation of their voice that makes any technical flaws as clear as possible. Vocal coaches on the other hand may be more interested in an authentic representation of the product (ie. the recorded song) that accurately represents how chosen stylistics and affects will be reflected in the final product. While a great voice teacher cannot necessarily be expected to know about production, a great vocal coach certainly should.\n\nSome people have also made the point that EQ and compression can to an extent be used to compensate for poor recording equipment or a poor recording environment, but before needing to even go there, let us recall that even an unedited recording is not a fully accurate representation of the voice. Different microphones have different profiles with regards to which frequencies they pick up the most (EQ) and with how they respond to different dynamics. Also, a dynamic range that is appropriate live is not necessarily appropriate in a recording (think of how many times you've sung something quiet but clearly audible, and then it was barely audible at all in the recording with the louder parts being suddenly too loud). Essentially, the very act of using a microphone is already making changes to the sound of your voice in the form of equalisation and altering dynamics, so it is inauthentic by necessity. \n\nA good use of post-production when asking for critique would be to make the recording as authentic as possible. Do not use it to cover up your flaws, but *do* use it to represent your voice as accurately as possible."}, {"comment_id": "ei4w1f6", "post_id": "aytwop", "comment": "I don\u2019t really agree, unless they\u2019re used too much.\n\n\nIf neither is used, the recording won\u2019t even sound the way the singer would sound in real life. A completely dry recording is not how you\u2019d sound in real life, and someone singing in a non-dead space is going to have reverb added by the the nature of the space anyway.\n\nEQ is something every microphone will do to your voice anyway, since no microphone is completely transparent anyway. \n\nCompression will also mostly deal with mic technique, and unless you\u2019re singing classical stuff, that\u2019s always going to be a factor.\n\nIf something in your singing is not an issue with those effects, is it really an issue? (unless classical, in which case, ignore compression/eq, but not reverb)\n\nAutotune only deals with pitch, so if one wants feedback on pitch, then obviously they shouldn\u2019t use it. Otoh if theyre using it, they probably know they\u2019re pitchy already.\n\nThere\u2019s going to be lots of people disagreeing, but it\u2019s my philosophy, so why not share \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\u263a\ufe0f"}, {"comment_id": "ei3i0iq", "post_id": "aytwop", "comment": "This is really good advice.

I've been teaching voice for 28 years, studied voice for 41 years, and post here regularly.  Regarding your first point, I use the term \"support\" all of the time because it is vital to good, full-bodied singing.  Of course, I ALWAYS explain what it means.  Support is generally misunderstood or not taught correctly, if taught at all.   I never say \"sing from your diaphragm\" because that just doesn't make sense (the diaphragm is an involuntary muscle), even though people have heard that all of their singing lives.  I know that you probably know all of this, so I am just chiming in.  I explain support in my video \"Supporting the Voice \u2013 CLEARLY and CORRECTLY explained (FINALLY!)\".   I have a YouTube channel filled with great info in everyday language that gives you quick fixes, as well as long term solutions, besides being entertaining (Victoria Rapanan - Healthy Vocal Technique).  [https://youtu.be/WR2772TGrgo](https://youtu.be/WR2772TGrgo)\n\nAs far as rates, there are a few teachers that I know of who charge $425-$600 an hour, and they get it!!  After 41 years of studying voice, I still take lessons and typically pay $200/hour for lessons.  I have paid more...  However, I am not your typical voice student, so my needs are quite different."}, {"comment_id": "f2q7rco", "post_id": "ddxzxl", "comment": "Ah, I agree with vocalizing that serves no purpose.  All vocalises must serve a technical purpose and improve upon technique.  \n\nThat said, I learned today in my voice lesson that you can also be a bad student and never realize what kind of teacher you have, lol.  If your teacher is going above and beyond to give you information, and you just assume you understand it, that's pretty bad as well.  I spent the last six months (and the years prior to when I was much younger) just nodding and smiling every time my teacher mentioned highly technical terms.  Last lesson she pointed out that I'd been doing just that and needed to research how voice production works (she didn't catch on until she asked me a specialize question, and I had no clue).  \n\nIn today's lesson, after two weeks of research, we experimented and had a huge breakthrough.  I discovered I hadn't actually been using my air while singing.  We knew I had a problem with pushing, taking too big of a breath, and jaw tension, but couldn't get to the heart of the matter.  I had no clue you could do what I basically dubbed \"false singing\" by just phonating the cords with no air compression behind it.  I started using air today, and WOW it was such a difference.\n\nSo, as a student, if you never ask any questions and take everything your teacher says at face value, you'll never even know if you have a good or bad teacher (turns out I have a great one, and I'm so happy right now).  And all of that said, totally agreed with the main post.  My teacher literally pulls out books showing how voice production works in the throat, because that's how her teacher taught.

If you just practice and practice you can eventually train your voice enough and you will be an \"amazing vocalist\".\n\nBut that is only half of the battle.  Because what made those singers unique was not the \"machinery of their singing\", it was the >brain< that was choosing what melodies to sing over the music, and how they were going to deliver that.  There are lots of singers who had great voices, but there was just nothing so unique about what they were singing.\n\nJust like there are guitarists who are great technicians, who are just not very interesting to listen to.\n\nBehind the body of a musician is the >brain< of a musician. What made Freddie unique was >what he chose to sing<.  His melodies and delivery were totally different to what most other rock singers were doing. If you wanted to really \"sing like Freddie\" you would have to have the same musical tastes as him, and have been exposed to the same music, and even then you would still sound different.\n\nIt's not like there is some secret weapon hidden in his vocal cords or his hard palette.

Also it's got that line/melody \"Any way you go,\" that is totally echoed in Bohemian Rhapsody.\n\nMy guess would be, hearing how much Freddie's voice tended towards going into breathiness that still somehow had vibrato (how the heck?), is that he's one of those singers with what I call \"vocal cords of steel.\" They can do almost anything vocally and still have a voice! But I think there's a LOT of throat tension that goes into his breathy tone.\n\nIt makes sense to think that if he learned, later in his career, how to sing more \"on the breath\" instead of from the throat, that he would have more good singing days.

Some of his higher notes leaning towards the \"4th octave\" weren't even consistent or dependable. \n\n- Yup, I always thought that his \"irregular\" vibrato was from tension in the throat. I always got so damn confused when people would be nitpicky about everyone's vibratos but his.\n\n- It always irks me how people write \"he's the best singer of all time\" or \"he's a god\" or whatever since 1) that's not how the arts work since one artist can be better at one aspect of singing than another so there is no actual \"best,\" and 2) all it takes is hard work, dedication, and passion to get to where he got. Nobody is \"born\" with a talent IMO -- they instead work hard to develop it. Freddie, to me, is a normal human being with normal abilities that simply *understood* music for what it was meant to be.\n\n- Singing is an art for a reason. I feel like too many singers just read the lyrics and try and repeat it whilst hitting the notes, but it really is more about the passion and story. \n\nThanks, OP, for finally making into words what's been in the back of my head for so long. I totally agree that people have been circle jerking over Freddie for the longest time for the wrong reasons.\n\nEdit: [Here's an example of his strained singing that I always expressed some concern over.](https://youtu.be/aA2IRoPFIn0?t=38) Notice how at first he seems nice and relaxed, but as soon as he belts out the \"love,\" the veins in his neck look like they're going to *EXPLODE*. WTF, that's a LOT of tension. And oddly enough, for some reason, vocal coaches on YouTube love to point out that \"veins popping out in the neck is a huge sign of tension when singing,\" but for some reason, they don't say it when it's Freddie. Interesting how that works. \ud83e\udd14"}, {"comment_id": "ezv3g5v", "post_id": "d2iibr", "comment": "Thanks for posting to r/singing! **Be sure to check [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/wiki/index)** to see if any questions you might have have already been answered!

I certainly have struggled with rule #1. I have definitely said, many times, \"If you're not gonna sing the song in the original key, maybe it's not one you should be singing at all\".\n\nI think possibly the reason I felt that way is that because I AM a singer, maybe I notice things like a key change in performances much more often than your average audience member, so sometimes it just seems a bit \"off\" to me. Also I could possibly be confusing two separate issues. I often get annoyed by hearing singers sing in the original key, but they don't have the range for \"the big note\" (think \"Creep\" by Radiohead) so they cop out by singing that note a whole octave down. I've always found that disappointing. But perhaps, if they changed the key of the whole song down, so that they could hit \"the money note\", it might have a much better overall effect.\n\nSwitching gears, have you found any success in remote vocal coaching via video chat?

I was told never to lift the shoulders when inhaling. However there are still more issues than just breathing to be fixed. I assumed from being taught by college vocal classes that we had to feel relaxed EVERYWHERE and feel effortless when singing. That was getting me nowhere with singing past D4. I had to back off a lot of my singing power lower to reach higher so it could blend with the rest of my range and it\u2019d always make a hooty/operatic-like (think of a male opera singer singing C5 but at G4) voice that doesn\u2019t suit anything I\u2019d like to sing. \n\nSo relaxing made me feel a bit lazy when singing stuff. Only got me to sing Sam Smith-type stuff. My speaking voice is already strong (when I\u2019m not being shy) but when I sung I was like 3x quieter than I speak and when I speak people normally ask me to repeat myself. Not until I got back to my \u201cpower\u201d voice where I began with, I started feeling my core area to do something and hit higher. Now instead of spreading wide, I think of making my words LONG and TALL without transitioning into a softer sound. Basically going higher you want to focus down low when youre going for higher intensity singing. It will make your abs kinda feel sore or engage if you sing a lot. The belly shouldn\u2019t feel loose like you ate a bunch of food and letting it stick out. That always led me to a sam smith sound. The voice should feel like you\u2019re holding back your yell ([pretend you\u2019re filming an advertisement for a product](https://youtu.be/a7aZgKpjDXY) \u2014 you should be in that volume and energy) and putting it into pitch for song.\n\nWhen you\u2019re angry at someone and scream at them you\u2019re going into danger zone. But when you tell the story to someone about you yelling you will naturally tone that screaming down. You will be like: \u201cI got so mad so I was like (reenacts the screaming but not the same intensity because you\u2019re talking to someone about that moment. Youd look like a weirdo if you went all out)\u201d. Then you put that into 5 tone scales for singing\u2014 try all vowels.

Scrutinise it intensely. You\u2019ll no doubt notice little awkward things, maybe some notes aren\u2019t perfectly in tune, maybe the singer has some odd pronunciation choices. Even a singer like Paul McCartney in his prime can start to sound funny in some ways, if you allow yourself to really hone in on the tiny details. \n\nPoint is, you can scrutinise almost any vocal and find things that are awkward or imperfect. The reality is that we don\u2019t usually listen this way - what we take in is the general impression of the melody and the overall recording. In other words, nobody who hears your recorded voice is possibly going to be analysing it in the same way that you are, and therefore their impression of it is likely to be more flattering.\n\nSide note - this is a big reason why a producer is important. Engineering one\u2019s own vocals is gruelling, and you can get into a rut where you hate everything you do.

I think for those people, joining a choir or doing a group singing class would be the better way to go.\n\nOutside of that, sure. I personally have played music since I was around 10 or so and sang in choirs from high school more or less forward. Before I started taking singing lessons I considered myself a bass/baritone who could sing higher but only in my falsetto. Now, a couple years into regular lessons, I can sing pretty easily in the tenor range - I even sang alto on a couple of songs in a choir I was in last year - and my tone is way, way better than it used to be. I can also sing in tune throughout my range without having to do little things that messed up my tone, which used to be a huge problem for me. Best of all, I can do all this without a lot of strain. I know I'll be better about that in a few months, just as I'm a lot better than I was a year ago, but, well, singing is a process.\n\nThat said, too, there are good coaches and bad coaches out there, but don't necessarily judge a coach on a the criterion of \"I came in to work on X but they are working on Y\".

In other words, the performance is what accentuates the passion in the song and in the singer. The passion is easier to notice on high notes because of the physicality of singing higher or belting.\n\nSo, if we follow along that logic and assume I'm right - high notes usually produce a performance that has implications of strain - whether the strain is there or not isn't really the point, but the emotional resonance increases in strength the more passionate the line feels. And I would say that generally speaking, high notes that singers have to work to comfortably hit have a certain tension that can be felt. That tension I think contributes a ton to the performance and thus it appears that people who sing higher are \"more into it\", \"feeling it\". I think an extremely passionate and well performed tune in lower note registers can absolutely accomplish this too - but it's not as easy to do it.\n\nI have zero vocal training and very little music theory in my background but I have just been obsessed with signing since I was a little boy so I feel like I understand it (even though I may be way off).

So this associates a reverse logic, that the higher you can sing, the more training you must have, and therefore the better singer you must be.

And again, thinking that the average listener may not know much about singing, they may not really know how to \u201cpay close attention\u201d to other facets of \u201cgood\u201d singing because they don\u2019t have the ears/experience to latch onto other things that the singer might be doing well, besides just singing high notes. \n\nSo I guess, hearing high notes is an \u201ceasy\u201d way for a listener to go \u201chey, that\u2019s something I can\u2019t do, they must be a good singer!\u201d While many other things that make up good singing might only be noticeable subconsciously (or not at all)."}, {"comment_id": "ew06c74", "post_id": "cm1y9r", "comment": "People want vocal range so that they don't have to worry about vocal range anymore.\n\nI used to be stuck on F4 for years.

It opens the doors to now being able to focus on what you want to convey, what you want to express more freely with less restrictions.\n\nCertain emotions require different note ranges to adequately express.  More intense emotions tend to require louder and higher pitches.  Being able to convey the feelings and thoughts you have without feeling limited by technical issues is such an important thing for singers to be able to do.\n\nWhen you are limited by range, it is harder to convey what you want to convey because you have an obstacle that is blocking what you are feeling and your ability to execute and act on that feeling.\n\nIt is just like learning a new language.

You can find recordings of just about every great rock singer on earth singing like crap because their voice was tired, monitors were bad, etc.\n\nI'd like to offer the point of view that a bad gig once in a while is actually a \\*good\\* thing. It's terrific that you recorded it.\n\nIdentifying the factors that go into creating a \"bad\" performance for you are incredibly important, and will help you develop a contingency plan in case those issues pop up again, making you a better singer overall. I've been working professionally as a singer for around 10 years now, and poor monitoring is the #1 cause of my sub-standard vocal performances. It will always be something you'll run into occasionally, especially as a metal singer where you're playing in venues with bad systems, apathetic sound engineers, etc.\n\nHere's how I make sure a bad sound situation doesn't ruin my day:\n\n1. I always use in-ears too. Mine are wireless. Get there early, and chat with the sound guy about making them happen. Ask if he has an extra aux send in the board, and can give you some of everything that's going into the sound board, but mostly your own vocals.  If he's a dick about it, set your transmitter up yourself at the foot of the stage, and run your mic directly through it into the board or snake. This is a super important thing to know how to do because you won't need to bug the sound tech, and if the stage volume is loud you'll be able to hear yourself almost as well as if you had your own custom mix.\n2. Bring earplugs to every gig. Having earplugs in will help you hear yourself in the unlikely event that your in-ears can't be used for some reason (like a festival where they're cycling between bands quickly). Also, ear protection is important, blah blah blah. =)\n3. Slip the sound engineer $5 or $10. A little gratitude goes a long way. Most of those folks can make bands and singers sound GREAT if they even give the tiniest bit of a crap, it's just that not a lot of them will unless they feel sufficiently motivated.\n4.

Like, to some degree, a guitar player can look down to see if they're playing the right notes. You can't physically look at your voice. It's 100% hearing. We get painted as 'divas' for fussing over monitoring sometimes, but singing without being able to hear yourself is like a guitar player playing with their middle and ring fingers taped together. They wouldn't be very happy after trying to do that for an hour either.\n\nMy point is, don't beat yourself up about it, but take steps to avoid that situation in the future. I don't play metal, but I used to play with a drummer who was heavily influenced by it, and volume was ALWAYS a struggle (lead to his eventual dismissal unfortunately).\n\nSome suggestions:\n- Invest in custom-molded in ear monitors, and actually use them (ie, get used to the 'isolated' feeling, there's ways to minimize it), or wear just in one ear, but that doesn't protect your ears nearly as much and isn't advised. I have my eye on westone eas10's, as they have plugs that allow you to let some ambient sound through.\n- Sounds like you're already doing this, but invest in a quality dynamic mic with excellent feedback resistance (hypercardoid maybe?) Bring your gain down and compensate with volume. This will effectively reduce the 'sensitivity' of the mic and should allow you to get louder before feedback. This is a bit of a moot point though if you get in-ears, because you no longer need stage monitors and if you're feeding back without stage monitors, you've got some bigger issues. That said, I would imagine that in a metal band, lowering the sensitivity of the microphones would improve the overall sound quality of the band, because it will reduce bleed from other loud instruments on the stage, leading to better control at the sound board.\n\nDon't beat yourself up, but don't run in a hamster wheel either.

Who is your target audience? Which people are you hoping will consult your chart and have their questions answered by it?\n\nThe answer will be mostly: young singers and beginners who are anxious to know where they fit in, who are worried about whether their range is big enough, or who want a label to identify with, or who are looking for solo repertoire to learn. A smaller subset of your audience will be composers, who want to know what range is suitable to write for voices. Your chart will do a disservice to all of these groups. It's not your fault, you're just going from the information provided by Wikipedia. It's Wikipedia's fault too.\n\nWhy is this information so wrong? For one thing, this chart assumes operatically-trained singers. This does not apply to most people, because most singers are not classically trained, and most of those who *are* don't sing opera. I know and work with a lot of professional, mostly classical, singers, and the majority of their voices do not align with this chart. Most tenors do not have a C5 in their range, for example. Most basses can either sing a low E, or a high E, but rarely both. Most women are capable of reaching an F3, and yet contraltos are quite rare.\n\nSecond, the chart has no way to account for tone or vocal colour, which are much more important than range. A young potential tenor, for whom a range of A2 - A4 is perfectly realistic, may consult your chart and think \"oh, I guess I must be a baritone\", and then start forcing their voice into lower keys, and trying to manufacture a darker timbre to fit this preconception of what they think they should be.\n\nIn terms of the presentation here, it's bad design to show all these ranges as discrete units with clearly defined starting and ending points. Voices simply aren't like that. The chart is going to provoke a lot of questions like \"my lowest note is F#2, so am I baritone or a bass?\". The outer limits of each voice would be more accurately depicted with the colour bars fading in and out from the background, to show that the actual limits will vary. You also have a lot of empty space at the upper and lower ends of the keyboard which doesn't need to be there.\n\nFor the other main group of people who might use this chart - composers - the chart gives an inflated sense of what voices are capable of. If I was to edit your chart for composers, I would draw it more like this:\n\nBass: E2 - E4 is a good range for adult choirs, but that's for the section as a whole, not for each voice. Anything below G2, or above C4, I'd write as divisi.\n\nBaritone: I wouldn't write above G4 for baritone soloists. A2 - F4 for choirs.\n\nTenor: C5? Only if you're an operatic soloist, and *even then* not all tenors would have it. C3 - G4 for choirs, anything A4 or above I'd likely start writing as divisi, with the 2nd tenors being given a lower option.\n\nCountertenor: Yes, *technically* I can sing E3, but you'd never hear it above accompaniment unless I sang it in chest voice (and if you're going to include chest notes, then you might as well keep going down into the baritone range). G3 - D5 is a safer maximum range (some can go higher, but never make assumptions).\n\nContralto: F3 - F5 is pretty good for a classical or operatic soloist, but bear in mind that this voice type is quite rare. Plenty of women can sing F3, but they aren't all contraltos.\n\nMezzo-soprano: A3 - A5 is a good range to write for operatic mezzos. In a choral, amateur, or untrained context, I'd write for them in the A3 - F5 range (and for anything below C4 I'd be inclined to double it with a lower voice).\n\nSoprano: Similar to the tenors, C6 cannot be assumed for all voices. A5 is more realistic.\n\nOr, even simpler, take four colour bars (representing soprano, alto, tenor and bass). Each one is a gradient, with a green zone in the middle (representing the range that all voices of that type would usually have) fading to a red zone at the edges (meaning that not all voices can be expected to have these notes). And make it clear that these describe vocal *parts*, not voice *types*. \n\nBass: Fading in around D2, red zone up to F#2, green zone from G2 to B4, red zone above C4, fading out around E4.\n\nTenor: Fading in around A2, red zone up to C3, green zone from D3 to F4, red zone above F#4, fading out around Bb4.\n\nAlto: Fading in around F3, red zone up to A3, green zone up to C5, red zone above C#5, fading out around F5.\n\nSoprano: Fading in around A3, red zone up to D4, green zone up to F5, red zone above that, fading out around Bb5.\n\n&#x200B;"}, {"comment_id": "egpr0su", "post_id": "arsaes", "comment": "Vocal type, just so you know, is in large part determined by voice color.

I'd say that if you're just starting out, another trick that can work for this is to do lip/tongue trills over the melody of the song you're learning. The advantage of doing it that way is that if you start to go a bit higher it's relatively hard to strain your voice while doing so. Also, trills require you to have breath support during the entire time that you do it.\n\nA good intermediate stage, too, is to sing just the vowels and leave out the consonants. The two things you want to bear in mind when you do this:\n\n1. Keep the tone sitting in the same place in your head during the song. You might feel it glide a bit higher as you move up in pitch and vice versa but the big thing you want to make sure you *don't* do is feel like, for example, your \"ah\" vowel feels like it's coming from a different place than your \"oo\" vowel. You want to form your vowels basically with the front of your tongue and your lips. Everything else should either stay the same or (in the case of stuff like how open your mouth is) vary based on pitch.\n\n2. Keep the airflow steady. This is easier to do when you don't have to worry about consonants and in fact that's kind of the point of the exercise. But if you get it down where your vowels transition without a break, you're close to achieving the paradigm of vowels and consonants, which is that in most circumstances you make notes with the vowels and use consonants only to cut syllables apart (and without stopping the flow of air). While there are *occasional* exceptions (sometimes you'll want to use \"m\" or \"n\" as a sort-of vowel) this is by and large how you want to sing.\n\nETA: with humming, too, what you want to do is keep your tone forward and up and drop your jaw to the point that it feels relaxed, even though your mouth will of course be closed."}, {"comment_id": "eh7t5tb", "post_id": "aud452", "comment": "It only works good for practicing singing softly without pushing for volume low to high AND finding a comfortable tone or getting in control of your lower-mid \"chest\" range like stuff below f4.

The only really specific advice I can add is:\n\n1. Raise your soft palate as you get higher\n2. Keep your jaw and especially your throat relaxed (this is not easy to do for us Type A people, as you can often kind of squeeze out notes if you do the opposite of this)\n3.

Definitely agree that being critical of yourself is one of the biggest things you can do in practice.\n\nAnd, to build on it, I think it's important to mention the importance of setting up a good practice space. To be very specific, one of the best implements as a singer you can have is a full-length mirror (or at least half length). There is a LOT you can learn about yourself singing by looking at what exactly your body is doing, keeping in mind that your instrument is literally your body.\n\nSo if possible, I'd say try to do at least half of your practicing in front of a mirror, and especially be aware of little details, whether it's posture, incorrect breathing (such as overly raised/tense shoulders), or weird mouth shapes. Those things may be hard to hear, but if you notice and correct those problems, it can definitely help your singing in the long run. \n\nIt is also a good idea to set up a practice area where you can hear yourself. This sounds like a \"duh\" thing, but I think sometimes issues with practicing are due to bad acoustics as much as actual problems. After all, if you can't hear a mistake in the first place, how can you fix it? \n\nIn a really ideal world, we'd always get to practice in the performance space or something with similar acoustics, and our performance spaces would always be acoustically perfect for singers. Reality, of course, is that most people won't have that luxury, and you have to make do with what you have.\n\nHowever, I still think a good acoustic setup can really help. If possible, singing into a space that is more on the side of resonant than dead can help you. Granted, if it's too resonant you may actually cover up mistakes by having sound overload, but if it's too dead you won't ever hear them at all. A good balance is key, and personally I think hearing too much is better than too little.\n\nAnother option is to record with a high-quality microphone designed for voices, and listening back. Since what you hear internally isn't the same as what the \"real world\" hears, it helps to listen to recordings and identify problems you may not be able to hear inside, especially as a beginner. I think a trick to good singing is learning to \"feel\" good technique rather than \"hear\" it, but it's hard to do that if you don't have an aural reference for what feels and sounds right. Unfortunately, though, current recording technology (especially the kind that most people can afford at home) won't catch everything, so recordings are not a replacement for a real life voice teacher or using your ears while actually singing. But, it can be a very good tool.\n\nIt is also important to work with a reference instrument that is in tune. For most people, this will probably be a piano. And while as a vocalist we may not feel that it's as important to invest a lot of time and effort into maintaining our practice pianos, it really is important and it is worth it. If you are using an acoustic piano of any kind, make sure it is serviced at least once a year if not once every six months, by a *qualified technician* (not just a tuner). It's important to use a good reference instrument, though, because you may be teaching yourself little errors in tuning that could come back to haunt you later. \n\nObviously, tuning isn't as much of a problem with digital pianos, which is why, contrary to my recommendation for beginning pianists, I personally actually recommend a high-quality digital piano for vocalists. Since the ability to create acoustic sounds is less important than working with an instrument that is in tune, I find digitals to be a great investment. If you can get one with a recording feature, you can also plunk through your own accompaniment and practice along with it, which can be a helpful tool that not all vocalists get to take advantage of (let's face it, nobody wants to hire an accompanist for every lesson/practice session). That being said, it's still worth it to invest in a good digital, preferably one that uses long-tone sampling from an acoustic grand, with all the pedals and that sort of thing. But it is important to have an instrument that stays in tune."}, {"comment_id": "c8464cp", "post_id": "17c6jx", "comment": "Thank you.  Just...thank you.

Like, listen to a white singer who was raised around \"black\" music for reference, like DeAndre Brackensick.   \n\n\nMany others have pointed out the general point that we tend to be drawn to the vocals we grow up with, and for many black folk there's a huge rnb and gospel influence. But it's a bit more than that, it's that many people who grow up in the church experience gospel singing LIVE and this is a huge thing - we learn a lot more from live singing than we do listening to recordings. On the other hand, many white folk grow up with virtually NO LIVE SINGING in their life. Maybe they have a church choir that sings hymns, or a worship band - but most of their singing experience revolves around \"just\" school choir and musical theater programs.   \n\n\nSecondly, there's the issue of audiation - how we imagine pitch. Many people who grow up listening to RnB and gospel are exposed to so many riffs and runs at a young age, and consume toooonnnsss of media that has them in it. Many white people who listen to country, pop, etc are not getting that \"ear training\" until later in life.   \n\n\nThirdly, there's cultural voice use. In my experience, this is more about socioeconomic status/location than race. Inner city kids are LOUD. White suburban kids tend to be told to \"use their inside voices\". There's not a whole lot of \"hooting and hollering\" going on in suburb, and if a young white kid does this they're usually 'the rowdy one' or 'the attention seeker' whereas that sort of vocal communication is pretty damn normal. Just ride the subway around after school lets out in Boston or New York and you'll see what I mean. Habitual voice use from a young age absolutely impacts the sounds you have available to you at the start of your singing voyage.   \n\n\nFinally, a lot of (especially white) teachers use \"healthy\" as coded racist language. It doesn't matter that we have countless models of people using growls and distortion and \"belting\" into their old age. These teachers simple DON'T KNOW HOW TO TEACH IT. In fact, many of the necessary qualities of the singing (robust posterior vocal fold closure, twang, varying laryngeal heights) are \"unhealthy\" to these teachers who literally don't know what they don't know.   \n\n\nSource: Life experience.

I\u2019m sure you realize this belief is racist, but seems well-founded by the way things appear. I honestly believe it\u2019s because white singing coaches have always taught if you try to sing like that, you\u2019ll destroy your voice. But there\u2019s two sides of the struggle however, or why that is the case. \n\nThe first part Is because white singing teachers teach it. The second part is white students try to prove them wrong. When the students try to prove them wrong, they inevitably take it too far and blow out their voice. This reinforces that the teacher was correct in the student\u2019s mind, that white people can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t try to sing like that. So at that point, the student accept they can\u2019t sing like that.\n\n Then the student becomes older and becomes the teacher of the next generation of students. The student is now the teacher, who has fully internalized that to be the truth, so it becomes part of the curriculum. And those students don\u2019t believe them because it seems racist, and inevitably blow out their voices. Thus, the cycle repeats itself.\n\nThe truth is white people can\u2019t sing black singers because white people have always been taught they can\u2019t. There\u2019s definitely been white peoples who sound indistinguishable from black people.\n\nIf you what you are saying is true, we could be able to tell the color of someone\u2019s skin based on their voice and that\u2019s bold face lie. Some black sound \u201cwhite\u201d. This point isn\u2019t never disputed, but those black people do it because that\u2019s how they were taught to. If that point is conceded, it would seem to only logically follow that some white people could sound potentially sound black, but there\u2019s no white teachers that do it, so none of them fully exert themselves to try to sound that way. \n\nIf it were true, that there were white people who believe they\u2019ve fully tried and they ended up with destroyed voice, we would see some white singers who have ended up with horrible injured voices, but we don\u2019t, because at some point they injure and from there, they learn they should play it safe.\n\nIt is true a lot of best white singers have had to have operations on their voices from overuse, but so have the best black singers, like Whitney Houston, she\u2019s not immune to the damage the voice because she\u2019s black. There probably are a lot more black singers who can sing in that style, but when you\u2019re in a larger group of people who can do it, you can do it more naturally without feeling like you\u2019re carrying the whole thing. You don\u2019t have to take it all the way, but other people will fill in when you can\u2019t.\n\nThe truth is, it can hurt your body if you\u2019re singing playing the way that sounds coolest. A lot of the greatest guitar players have fucked up hands when they\u2019re old for similar reasons, it wearing on them over time because everything gets wear and tear over time, it eventually catches up to them.\n\nSo It\u2019s true those singers wouldn\u2019t be hurting their voice if they weren\u2019t trying to sing like that, but at the same time, if they were taking the precautions that would have prevented that, they wouldn\u2019t sound like they do and you never would have heard of them.\n\nOne last point to consider. For a lot of blacks, music was their ticket to success in society. So it was to their advantage not to teach other people how to do it, because at that point, they\u2019re helping their competition and hurting their own chances of standing out."}, {"comment_id": "esziisb", "post_id": "c9abwa", "comment": "I know this isn\u2019t the most PC response, and I\u2019m very wary of in any way adding to the insidious mythology surrounding racial differences, but I\u2019m guessing it\u2019s both genetic and environmental.

Those people who like other genres probably dont like the way these other people sing and vice versa because they arent used to it or giving it a chance. \n\nOh well im tired. 4th of july got me tired \ud83d\ude02\ud83e\udd23"}, {"comment_id": "ekkhc09", "post_id": "bbpuh1", "comment": "Thanks for posting to r/singing! **Be sure to check [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/singing/wiki/index)** to see if any questions you might have have already been answered!

So much of singing is confidence and that can be hard. You could be really good but if you don't believe it, the doubt will come through. It took me a while to get used to the sound of my voice, to not hear it without feeling self-conscious, but eventually you just do. I still feel nerves before I perform, and probably always will. Every show is different, but I think it's more excitement than fear for me.

It is inspiring as fuck, and I think a lot of people in this community can learn from your story, including myself.\n\nMy self, being very aware of my singing, including judging my own abilities against others, have a hard time practicing and singing in front of others.  \nI think it's a question about being vulnerable, when singing.\n\nI think I will try to use your story to my benefit, and start practicing everyday, and leave all self-doubt behind. If a fellow reddit user can do it, so can I. Right? :)  \n\n\nKeep up the good work, and let us know how everything goes.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n\\- C.
