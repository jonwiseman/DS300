You guys can also be in fact ACTUAL TENORS who also have yet to: mature, sing and train enough (vocal development is complete from 25-30 years old)\n\nDuring two years, I spent six months of training until now as a 21 years old to discover that I was not even a \u00ab\u00a0Low Tenor\u00a0\u00bb. I\u2019m a light Tenor like most young Tenor voices. And that revelation is proven by my REAL passagio (F4/F#4) which took me those six months to discover. \n\nA lot of you haven\u2019t even taken a vocal lesson and then when you break at D#4, you go into the \u00ab\u00a0Baritone Curse\u00a0\u00bb depression mode when you don\u2019t even know how your voice functions and where you lie technically. Some of you like to talk about your \u00ab\u00a0supported\u00a0\u00bb Baritone F#4 and A2 but nah, that\u2019s just you trying to fool yourself, thinking that one month of practice is already enough to strengthen support. And trust me, I LIVED THROUGH THAT PHASE, I know what I\u2019m talking about.\n\nAs for the real Baritones, look at Countertenor singers singing operas of the XVIIIth century, they\u2019re MOSTLY BARITONES. The arias they perform are often filled with passages that showcase castrati\u2019s virtuosity: extremely fast and extended runs, high notes jumping all over the place, etc... such difficulty, yet so many Countertenors are riding those phrases with relative ease. That take some years of training from your chest to head register. I only know of two professional Countertenors who are naturally Tenors. \n\nMen\u2019s voices are generally the same when it comes to speaking. Chest dominant and tend to go towards the Baritone colour and range. When you sing, it\u2019s a different story. Not only you sing differently than you talk, but Tenors (SHOULD) use a different, lighter approach than lower voices to reach their high notes. They have a smaller voice, so we can\u2019t really bring our modal voice from G4 to C5 without using some covering, even if we can sing higher than you naturally. Speaking about singing higher, I\u2019ve met some really heady Baritones and some really thick Tenor voices that may confuse the inexperienced listener. \n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to use your head voice (falsetto, mixed voice are in the same category for us classical vocalists). Lower voices have a better extension in the head voice than Tenors do. Sing in a way that\u2019s comfortable for you. Don\u2019t rush. Good results will come. You just need to be patient. And DON\u2019T BE OBSESSED with voice types, ESPECIALLY FACH which has nothing to do with you if you don\u2019t sing operas from Rossini to Romanticism (from Baroque to early Classicism, it\u2019s almost exclusively Lyric Tenors)"}, {"comment_id": "exixsgh", "post_id": "cswgzd", "comment": "I didnt read all the comment but from what i did i do agree.
