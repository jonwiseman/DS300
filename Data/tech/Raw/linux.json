A old PC may be cheap in price but expensive in cost due to power consumption and low reliability (especially fans and hard drives).\n\nI have a Socket 939 Athlon 64 eMachines system with an MSI OEM motherboard that I've been trying to figure out what to do with.  It's a 2GHz single-core with an nForce 430 chipset.  I did a forced BIOS upgrade to the board to get around the various restrictions eMachines had but lost the on-board video and ethernet port in the process.  Not a problem since the 6100 GPU is obsolete and ethernet NICs are common.  I added a Radeon HD 4770 Pro card and installed 64-bit Xubuntu 17.04 on it.  With some BIOS tweaking I was able use four 1GB dual-rank DDR modules in multichannel mode at 400MHz without failures (tricky since most CPUs of that era that limited 400MHz operation to four RAM ranks).\n\nThe CPU has SSE 3 but is missing a few instructions that modern apps expect.  Steam worked but the Steam browser didn't.  Torchlight, Postal 2, and Serious Sam 3 worked but not Torchlight II or the new Shadow Warrior (illegal instruction errors).  The latter two worked on a slightly newer dual-core Athlon 64 X2 system I previously built.\n\nI can get a Socket 939 dual-core Athlon from eBay for about $25 USD, add a PCIe WiFi card for $15, and get a 17-inch 1280x1024 LCD from the local Goodwill thrift store for $15 (or a CRT for free from the local recycling place).  I'm not sure what the value of such a system would be since many people have switched to laptops and newer desktop PCs are piling up at recyclers every day.  With an 89W power consumption for just the CPU I'm not sure if $50 is a good investment for anyone looking for a cheap PC, especially compared to the prices of old laptops on eBay or Craigslist.  I know of people who have switched entirely to smartphones and/or Chromebooks.\n\nIf I keep the existing CPU then non-technical users will be annoyed at non-functioning games and the Steam browser and blame the problem on Linux.\n\nI recently scrapped most of my PC collection (about 10 desktops) eliminating anything that wasn't 64-bit dual-core.  The steel cases, aluminum heatsinks, and copper wire were worth about $42 at the scrapyard and it cost me $3 to get rid of the plastics.  I'm not sure they were worth $39 even if they were fully functioning with new Linux installs."}, {"comment_id": "dlbd3eq", "post_id": "6s95wy", "comment": "You tell Tim G I said.......he forgot to mention it's free"}, {"comment_id": "dlbdifx", "post_id": "6s95wy", "comment": "Linux is a great OS.

This is fully counter productive, if someone happens to have the knowledge that they can grab the signal that goes to the monitor and use that to copy to a file, they can also find what in the monitor is taking care of the decryption of that image and get the data itself. This doesn't avoid piracy at all, it will still happen and it only hurts the normal user that wants to make use of their service.\n\nThis is taking into account that they are doing this because they want to protect their data, because they could very much be doing this as to have production deals with the manufacturers as to make sure the consumer have to buy those specific hardware components, thus creating an oligopoly over the industry. Yes this will make your company more profit within the short term, but also will stop people from using your service LEGALLY.\n\nThat's what I don't get about these guys, piracy will always find a way to be, but as a company what you have to do is provide a better service than the pirates and people will flock to your service. Making the pirate's work harder by also hurting the normal user will always have the side effect of driving people away from your product and towards piracy.\n\nSpecially nowadays as more and more people become more and more skilled with technology, making sure that pirates can't grab your content will become increasedly harder, now I'm not saying they shouldn't protect their content, they should, but people will always want convenience, people PAY for convenience. You could call using bio fuel \"fuel piracy\", now what do you do to fix this? Make sure that the car breaks if you use this \"pirated fuel\"? Or provide a nice confortable service so people can easily get your product in a more convenient way than making their own bio fuel? of course they do the latter! Because that's how it works! (Note: I do not believe that fuel companies are an actual example of good company, looking at you chebron.)\n\nFor the love of god companies should stop making their services more closed and uncomfortable to normal users, for as soon as another company that offers a better service rises, people will move away if they see fit. And if companies want to stay competitive they should want to make sure THEY are that more comfortable service, that's how capitalism SHOULD work.\n\n</rant>"}, {"comment_id": "d16dxaa", "post_id": "4b63mj", "comment": "You are really blaming the messenger, HDCP compliance is nothing new and is required for pretty much all DRM protected content.

Government agencies may make their software \"open\" within a particular community. I worked on a software project that was free for any law enforcement agency to use.

Military contracts? Proprietary software bought? All valid questions, but those are questions of implementation. Our demand is that the default is: public money? Public code!

One core principle of democratic elections is that the public shall exercise a close scrutiny of each step of the process. Electronic vote is good as long as the whole chain remains open to this public scrutiny, and that of course includes the insides of the software.\n\nNow of course there is the question of costs.

Make the entire game a service as a software substitute. No game code runs on the client machine. The client literally just sends keystrokes / controller input and receives audio samples and rendered frames. Obviously, if this were implemented, it would have to be on a really, really powerful server, and everyone who played it would have to have a really, really good Internet connection. This might not be feasible with current technology, but I think we can get there.\n2. Make the service as a software substitute in question free as in libre (not as in gratis obviously) and open source, but not the non-code server files it accesses. That way, users know what code they're running even if it's not running on their own computer, and they have the freedom to fork that code and make their own rules if they don't like it, but they still don't have any knowledge that could give them an unfair advantage (since all such knowledge, e.g. enemy hit points, etc, would presumably correspond to the contents of databases, etc, rather than anything in the game code).\n3. Make the server security really robust so that even people with access to the game's source code can't access the server or the game running on it in any unintended ways. That is, absolutely zero security through obscurity, all security through means that can't be circumvented with mere knowledge.\n4. Have some objective way of measuring player skill in the game, and if anyone's skill suddenly drastically increases in a way that can't easily be accounted for by the natural learning process, suspect them of botting, and, accordingly, temp-ban them into a monitored single-player jail until their measured skill within that jail returns to normal.\n5. Also, have some constant known skill ceiling, such that *even if* someone *could* naturally achieve such skill without botting, it would definitively still ruin the experience for everyone else, and if anyone achieves that skill level, do the same thing, temp-ban them to skill-cap jail and let them back in when they start playing nice.\n6. Or better yet, have multiple incremental skill ceilings, and use them to control access to different competitor pools. That way, people who want to bot, or want to be so good they could be accused of botting, can play with people doing the same thing, and no one else has to get salty over it. Also, complete beginners don't get powned by ordinary players.\n\nI really think this could be done.

I'd say you'd scare newcomers off completely unless they really enjoy tinkering and debugging.\n\n## Arch Linux\n\n>If you also have a small device such as a Raspberry Pi and need to stick a lightweight OS on it, you can\u2019t go wrong with Arch\n\nArch does not work on the RPi. archlinux-arm does, but that is an unofficial fork.\n\n# Command line\n\nOhh boy, my forte.\n\n## echo\n\nDon't teach people echo.\n\nIf you want to teach good habits from the start, get people using `printf %s\\\\n \"$var\"`. I'm not joking. [`echo` cannot be relied upon to output the contents of a variable](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/65803/why-is-printf-better-than-echo).\n\n## cd\n\n> ~ (home directory). This directory defaults to your \u201chome directory\u201d. Such as /home/pete.\n\n\"defaults to\" -- well, it's *always* the home directory. No \"default\" about it.\n\nProbably worth mentioning that you can use ~ in any command, as it's part of the shell rather than part of cd.\n\nAlso worth mentioning is `cd` (without arguments), which takes you to your home directory too.\n\n## ls\n\n> List Directories\n\nIt can be used on single files too (usually with `-l`, to see extended info about the file).\n\nThe formatting in the example output is all messed up, the indentation doesn't match properly.\n\n## touch\n\n> Touch allows you to the create new empty files.\n\n\"to the create\" - typo\n\nAlso, it doesn't create files per se. You get the same effect with `:> filename`. Creating a file is only a side-effect of its main purpose, which is to update a file's modification time.\n\n## history\n\n> clear\n\nProbably worth mentioning ctrl+L, which does the same thing in bash.\n\n## cp\n\n> `*` the wildcard of wildcards, it's used to represent all single characters or any string.\n\nA rather awkward definition. What is a \"wildcard of wildcards\"? How is \"all single characters\" not covered by \"any string\"?  I would describe it as \"matching any string of any length, including matching nothing at all\".\n\nIt would also be worthwhile to mention that this too is a feature of the shell and not of cp, so it can be used anywhere. For better or for worse, it works in things like `echo *` or `cd P*res` (\u2190 might cd to \"Pictures\", if you have a folder like that).\n\n## mv\n\n> `$ mv file2 to /home/pete/Documents`\n\n... `to`? That's a mistake.\n\n## help\n\nDon't cover this command, it's rubbish. It's also bash-specific, not even supported in zsh (a very popular and more featureful alternative to bash).\n\n> `$ help ls`\n\n    bash: help: no help topics match `ls'.  Try `help help' or `man -k ls' or `info ls'.\n\n## Alias\n\nTeach people functions instead. (Or as well?) Aliases are very often abused, and writing a function is just like writing any other script while aliases have their own different rules.\n\n> `$ alias foobar=\u2019ls -la\u2019`\n\nYou have smart quotes here, which make this a syntax error.\n\n## exit\n\nMention Ctrl+D.\n\n# Text processing\n\n## env\n\n> `echo $HOME`\n\nDon't teach people bad habits.\n\n1. echo (mentioned before in this post)\n2. quote your variables!\n\nMaybe it's worth mentioning non-environment variables too. Variables you set in the shell aren't put into the environment by default, and must be `export`ed for that to happen. Exporting them to the environment lets any newly launched commands from that shell see them.\n\nEDIT: regarding variable quoting, it's necessary to actually be able to pass the value of a variable. *Not* using quotes is equivalent to doing 2 things to the variable:\n\n1. splitting it based on any character in `$IFS`\n2. treating it as a glob and expanding it like that.\n\nThat means if you had a variable with the content `*    WARNING    *`, and tried to print it with `echo $var`, the fact that it's not quoted will mean that the `*`s get treated as globs and start matching files, so you end up with a very messy message which spits out a load of files into the terminal. Also, the consecutive spaces are all collapsed into one space (because the shell splits the variable by spaces, then echo joins it all with 1 space in between each part).\n\nTry it at home:\n\n    var='*    WARNING    * : Something or other blah!'\n    echo $var\n\n## cut\n\n> `$ echo The quick brown; fox jumps over the lazy\tdog > sample.txt`\n\nThe semicolon ruins the command, and the tab isn't picked up because the shell uses it as an argument delimiter. Quote properly. In this case, use single quotes, because you are doing no variable substitutions.\n\n## head/tail\n\nMerge these 2 pages, they're very similar.\n\nAlso mention:\n\n* `head -10 file` -- you can use that as a shorthand for `head -n 10 file`.\n* `tail -n +10 file` -- display file **starting from** line 10\n\n## join/split\n\nTurn this into 2 pages. The commands aren't opposite to each other, so grouping them is misleading.\n\n`join` is supposed to join by columns. In your example, you're using it wrongly, and it's identical to `paste -d ' ' file1.txt file2.txt`\n\n`join` only works on sorted input.\n\nEDIT: An example I might give for join:\n\n`says.txt`, what animals say:\n\n    Cat     Meow\n    Cow     Moo\n    Dog     Woof\n\n`baby.txt`, what their young are called:\n\n    Cat     Kitten\n    Dog     Puppy\n    Horse   Calf\n\nNote that they're sorted by the first column, which is what we're joining on.\n\n`join says.txt baby.txt` will output:\n\n    Cat Meow Kitten\n    Dog Woof Puppy\n\nIt looks at the first column, filters it down to what the 2 files have in common, then joins the columns from each file.\n\nIt's short for `join -1 1 -2 1 says.txt baby.txt` where `-1 1` means it looks at the first column in the first file, and `-2 1` means it looks at the first column in the second file. Any column can be used as long as the file is sorted correctly by that column.\n\nThat said, `join` is not a very commonly used command, so you might not need to go very in depth there.\n\n## sort\n\n> And also sort via numerical value:\n\nThere are no numbers here. This example makes no sense.\n\nEDIT: So for a more useful example, you should have something like:\n\n    4 elephants\n    19 penguins\n    38 giraffes\n    1 snail\n    2 turtle doves\n\nWithout `-n`, that gets sorted into the \"wrong\" order, but with `-n` it sorts as you'd expect. Without `-n`, 38 comes before 4 because it sees the \"3\", notices it comes before \"4\", then sorts based on that.\n\n## uniq\n\nYou need to mention here that it only removes *adjacent* unique lines. You should use `sort -u` instead of `uniq` if you can't guarantee that.\n\n## nl\n\nMention that it doesn't number blank lines by default\n\n## grep\n\n> `$ ls | grep *.txt /somedir `\n\nThis is very, very wrong.\n\n1. `ls | grep` is an antipattern\n2. `*.txt` is a glob, meaning it will be expanded on the command line into something else\n3. `*.txt` is not a regex, so grep won't work with it\n4. `/somedir` should be an argument to ls\n\nThe correct way of doing this would generally be `ls /somedir/*.txt`, but in the interests of showcasing `grep`, you can do it like this: `ls /somedir | grep '.txt$'`. `.txt$` is a regex, so it has unusual syntax compared to something like a filename glob. The `$` is regex speak for 'end of line', that is, it will match any line of `ls` which ends in `.txt`.\n\nI'll stop on that page for now.\n\nI appreciate you trying to teach the linux command line, but please verify what you put in the tutorial; at the moment, a lot of it is either misleading or wrong, and will only confuse users."}, {"comment_id": "d3srnda", "post_id": "4m4mko", "comment": "I like it.

(useless use of cat)\n* sudo su (instead of sudo -i/sudo -s)\n* chmod -R a+rwx  (instead of rwX)\n* ...\n\nOne of the first question a new user has, **which distro to choose**.

However, I am fine with you advocating and using Linux Mint, but there are some factual inaccuracies in your distributions section.\n\n---\n\nI imagine that the section on distributions will get a lot of controversy. One the one hand, it's probably not a good idea to introduce too many distributions from the start, I think that a lot of newbies find this daunting. But people who use certain distributions think they are very justified in using those distributions and want other people to use them. It's up to you, but I would try to limit it to a few, about as many as you have now. You could have a later section which details more distributions for those who are interested.\n\nHaving said that, CentOS deserves a mention in RHEL because it is pretty much an open-source version of RHEL (I'm paraphrasing, someone who uses RHEL/CentOS will be able to phrase that better) and I don't think one sentence on CentOS will complexify that section much.\n\nA better way to describe Debian Testing is to say that that is the development release for the next version of Debian. It's like using Windows 10 before it has been released. Debian Unstable is more of a rolling release, which means that you never need to upgrade your operating system, but, as the name suggests, expect bugs and crashes.\n\nA better way to describe Fedora is RHEL/CentOS for desktops. CentOS is the distro better described as RHEL without the price tag.\n\nI disagree with what you've written in most of the Linux Mint page. You're entitled to your opinion, if you think Linux Mint is the most easy-to-use operating system and you want to say that, that's fine, but there are some factual inaccuracies.\n\n'It uses Ubuntu\u2019s software repositories so the same packages are available on both distributions.' - Not technically true, more true to say that it's based on Ubuntu and is able to use Ubuntu software repositories (PPAs, but you don't need to say that). I think the mention of LMDE (Debian-based Mint) would complexify this section too much, LMDE is not yet the default, best just to talk about Linux Mint.\n\n'Linux Mint is preferred by others over Ubuntu because it doesn\u2019t come with the some of the proprietary software that Ubuntu includes such as Unity.' - Not true, it's actually preferred because it includes and uses proprietary software by default (and, you'll probably want to say, that makes it easier to use). But they've just said that they'll stop releasing proprietary media codecs in the install, due to licensing issues, but they still tend to recommend proprietary software more than Ubuntu does. Also, Unity is not proprietary software, it is open-source (Landscape is Canonical proprietary software).\n\n'Great user interface, great for beginners and less bloated than Ubuntu.' I'm fine with the first two statements, what do you mean by the third? I can see you're trying to use the rule of 3 here, but you still want to be accurate, right?\n\n'Similar to Debian, Arch uses a rolling release model so incremental updates eventually become the Stable release.' Not correct, probably should read 'similar to Debian Unstable, Arch uses a rolling release model so you never need to upgrade your distribution, but this may come at a cost for stability [though that is debateable, hence I said *may* come at a cost for stability]."}, {"comment_id": "d3t0ay3", "post_id": "4m4mko", "comment": "Thank you for developing this.

It's beautifully designed, simply explained, and goes to a fairly high level; a combination that many resources for Linux just don't have.\n\nWith that being said, I did do the first two courses just to see what they were like and I do have a couple of suggestions:\n\n**GETTING STARTED**\n\na) Really stress in the section about choosing a Linux distribution that in the end, it doesn't matter what you choose.  Frankly for many users the biggest differences end up being the DE/WM (which can be changed) and the package manager.  Far too often new Linux users will post questions in forums or on social media asking which distribution they pick (or worse, which is \"the best\") and it turns into a flame war.  I can't recommend enough that you stress that it's your own preference in the end\n\nb) I would give a bit more of a warning about Gentoo and Arch (particularly Arch - you at least mentioned that Gentoo is more of a challenge).  Neither is for the faint of heart)\n\n**COMMAND LINE**\n\na) This one is less of an opion thing and more of a factual thing.  Don't say that touch creates a file, that's not its core purpose.  Touch updates a file (you're \"touching\" that location on the disk).  So if you touch a file that already exists the last modified date will change.  If you touch a file that does not exist, it has to create the file in order to set the last modified date so it does that.\n\nI'll keep going through the tutorials and if I spot something I'll use the contact email at the bottom to let you know.  Like I said though, this is a fantastic resource.  I plan to direct a couple of my friends to this.

Like my Linux Certified System Administrator training goes over run levels, differences between GRUB versions, the file system structure, etc.  That'd be really useful and would turn it from a fun hobby website into something you can potentially monetize since it follows the easy-to-use format of CodeAcademy that is already popular."}, {"comment_id": "d3txtk6", "post_id": "4m4mko", "comment": "Forgive me if this is covered: are you considering a \"religious wars you may encounter\" page?\n\nTrying to give an objectively neutral intro to the, sometimes, heated debates over these may give your audience at least a fighting chance to understand WHY they are so inflammatory.

It's one of those features I never paid attention to for a long time (beyond knowing I have to escape exclamation points) but when I saw how useful `sudo !!` is, I started reading more about it, and now I use it all the time.\n\nFor instance, let's say you're running the following commands (the first one by accident, of course):\n\n    convret Image_With_Long_Filename_2834571938.png Image_With_Long_Filename_2834571938.jpg\n    convert Image_With_Long_Filename_2834571938.png Image_With_Long_Filename_2834571938.jpg\n    cp Image_With_Long_Filename_2834571938.png /media/photo_storage_drive_a/image.png\n    cp Image_With_Long_Filename_2834571938.jpg /media/photo_storage_drive_b/image.jpg\n    umount /media/photo_storage_drive_a /media/photo_storage_drive_b\n\nYou can save yourself a lot of typing with autocomplete, but not for the first instance of the .jpg file which doesn't exist at that point, and if there's a lot of similarly-named files it can still be annoying. Here's how you can use the ! syntax to make this much easier:\n\n    convret Image_With_Long_Filename_2834571938.png !#:1:r.jpg\n    convert !*\n    cp !!:1 /media/photo_storage_drive_a/image.png\n    cp !conv:2 !!:2:h:s/_a/_b/\n    umount !!:2:h !-2:2:h\n\nThat may not look very intuitive, but it's much quicker, and once you get used to the syntax it comes pretty naturally, at least it did for me. Also when you're actually typing the commands, it echoes the expanded command line to the terminal, so you can look back at it when you type the next command.

It was as simple as wanting to automatically set my GPU overclock on boot via rocm-smi (I've found it to be one of the easiest OCing tools I've ever used, I can basically have Unigine Heaven running on a loop in a Borderless Window on my main screen and adjust clocks/voltages in a terminal window on my second screen in real time without any frustration from UI lag or the like) which created the issue of reapplying my settings each boot as it's 8 separate commands that I have to supply input to. (Just a \"y\" or \"n\" to say I accept that I'm overclocking)\n\nA lot of you likely will already figure out where I'm going with this, but writing a simple script of the commands I required and then setting it to run automatically on boot as \"yes | ~/GPUOC\" works flawlessly and runs in such a way that the only noticeable difference is the clocks. I know there's easier ways of doing it, but I really like this because it means that I not only get to set up a fully custom clock profile easily (I've basically made my R9 Nano run low volts and clocks for idling/low usage games/movie decoding but still clock above even where a stock Fury X is when I'm gaming while still undervolted and allowing the fan to ramp up more to prevent throttling for maximum performance) but also have it automatically set without needing an extra program constantly running in the background, both of which are things I had a *lot* more trouble doing with GUI tools on Windows than I have on a CLI with Linux."}, {"comment_id": "ew7n01r", "post_id": "cn5ea3", "comment": "For searching in history, I used to use `ctrl+r` until I found `history-search-backward`.

Now that all IT security experts urge to reduce complexity and keep things simple again, Slackware is more topical than ever. It greatly shows, that the old principles of KISS and \"one tool, one job\" were right all along.\n\nSadly many GNU/Linux distros dismissed those principles  nowadays. Therefore the existence of Slackware is a blessing."}, {"comment_id": "dkcv8h7", "post_id": "6nvjb5", "comment": "Congrats Patrick.

Get it wrong and you risked cooking the monitor.  In the end it worked.\n\nThe trick was to hook up a terminal to the serial port so you could log in and kill off the X server if you got the mode lines wrong.\n\nAt one point I had some news groups coming in via a UUCP feed and some coming in from university via NNRP.  After a couple of days tinkering I got C-News and suck to interface together by faking a UUCP feed and building a script that picked up the outgoing articles, clipped off the header line placed by the UUCP handler and pushed the postings out to the university's news server.\n\nAnd then there was getting a ghostscript renderer to work as an lpr destination.  That was a fiddle, but I could typeset stuff with LaTeX and get it to print on the inkjet.  However, I'll still argue that it's easier to figure out how to do that than to figure out how to configure CUPS by hand.\n\nOr there was the bit where I got an email feed working - first with SMail and then with Postfix - and figuring out why it kept redirecting mail to a complete stranger.  Every couple of minutes it would poll for outgoing mail and dial out if it needed to.  Of course, mail was going via UUCP to my ISP for my personal account and by SMTP to my university account.  The dialer had to dial out for each connection and not attempt to dial out if I was online to the university.\n\nNFS and NIS is actually quite straightforward.  SAMBA is much more complex to set up - especially if you want it to play nicely with a domain controller (let alone being a PDC).\n\nI had a nice 486/100 at the time with a whopping 16MB of RAM, later upgraded to 32. - this was actually a fairly beefy machine by the standards of the day - until I got a summer job in the civil engineering dept for a guy who had a DEC Alpha with 512MB of RAM.  This was my first ever paid programming gig; porting a finite element model written in Fortran to run on DEC Visual Fortran.  In the end it consisted of changing 6 lines of code and writing a makefile, then getting it to work with the Visual Studio build tool (DEC bought VF off Microsoft).  \n\nThe program was called SAFIR and modelled heat transfer in steel beams based on an ISO standard fire.^^1  The catch was that the program was written by someone in Belgium and documented in French.\n\nUphill both ways, etc.\n\nNow get off my lawn.\n\n\n*************\n\n^1 I bet that today you just learned that there's an ISO standard fire.  Of course there's an ISO standard fire.\n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dkcrukg", "post_id": "6nvjb5", "comment": "The distro I both love and hate. Lol Really great for installing to almost anything.

Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called Linux, and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.\nThere really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux.

Even better would be config file to choose to have separate install and search or have them unified as ultimate package installation tool.\n\nThen such package manager would recognize Microsoft C++ Expresss 2010 in metadata of build-essential package for Debian. But apt doesn't do that, yet it does many stupid things. Like enabling services by default without asking user does he want that or not. Seems like sensible things to do but trust me, there are situations when that isn't desirable behavior.\n\nI don't think that Jeffery Deval is stupid, his assumption is not wrong. Linux packaging systems are simply imperfect.\n\nEdit: I don't know what accio is, I was already too old for them when Harry Potter books were popular.\n\nEdit2: About installing requiring root privileges via sudo. Well, certain software asks for root password even if you don't put sudo in front of command. That software is certainly smarter than package managers which will complain they have no privileges to install packages or in other words, modify root partition.

Be it for up-to-date Flash on Linux browsers  or Netflix, all requires Chrome exclusively. Much of the time, even Chromium is insufficient as some functionality requires the Chrome App Store instead.   \n\nFor users of Mozilla Firefox or other true FOSS browsers (I still find Chromium to be designed with Google's, not the users', service in mind. Remember back to the early days when true ad-blocking wasn't possible the way it was in Firefox, if I recall correctly?),  it is becoming a dim prospect to see  this horrid evolution. I'm not willing to use a browser that is designed to serve the wills of Google and further envelop all my personal information into their ecosystem to be mined at their leisure, and I resent  seeing a rift form where Chrome's proprietary methods are the only gateway to some 3rd party functionality.  \n\nIts bad enough to see many users swayed to Chrome/ium's ecosystem for whatever shiny bit is dangled as the new hotness, regardless of the possibly serious yet covert threat to privacy of embracing another Google program.  However, its even worse that sometimes, this means that it appears that there are certain things you can't do on Firefox, because Netflix, Authy, Adobe and others decided to back Chrome-exclusive methodology. \n\nFrustrating indeed.  When native playback comes on Firefox or another FOSS vector, then we shall talk. At this point, I'd even rather have a binary blob from Netflix directly, without giving Google a chance to peek in.

It doesn't sound like even they have any confidence and its success. I question what they really intend to have running on this is it designed to compete with the current console Market? This thing has specs similar to current systems and capable of running games of the current generation it could potentially have a chance. However the fact that it's only being funded through Indiegogo despite being a system from a large company and nobody else has reported on this makes me think that this is nothing more than their attempt it's something similar to a steam machine. And honestly it's not a bad idea it just needs to be done properly with good marketing and set up in a way that people can utilize it.\n\nPersonally I don't think that this is going to be a console that's going to encourage developers to start building for Linux any more than the steam machine did. It's a nice thought but until there is a major Flagship console platform designed to compete in every way with current consoles, then it's not happening. Even then it's a stretch. Getting people to switch consoles now is so difficult when everybody has all of their friends on one system.

No solution fits that is one size fits all as there are plenty of polarizing subjects. For example many parents would vehemently insist that their 13 year old has access to sex education information, while many parents would vehemently insist the opposite. Secondly, there is no such thing as a perfect filter. It will let things through that it shouldn't do, and block things that it shouldn't do.

We do not play the game of catching up with a \"competitor\" who has the funds we are never going to have. We do design decisions based on what seems consistent with the rest of GIMP and what generally makes sense.\n\nGIMP will never be Photoshop.\nKrita will never be Corel Paint.\nInkscape will never be Illustrator.\nBlender will never be Maya.\nKdenlive will never be Premiere.\nArdour will never be ProTools etc.\n\nIf you want your report to be useful, please request things that have intrinsic value rather than \"things that Y program has\".

Contributions are most welcome here.\n\nThere is ongoing work on performance which is extremely important in a professional setting.\n\nWe also try to backport as much as possible to 2.10.x, so most new things we write about on social media are not light years away, but a mere month or two \u2014 yes, there have been 3 updates with bugfixes and new stuff since 2.10.0 released in late April. Which seems to cause people to think GIMP \"stopped stagnating\" (we just didn't do releases as frequently before and didn't include new stuff to stable releases).\n\nThere certainly is room for small improvements and features all around, but unless more people like Ell come out of the blue and start producing amazing code, please don't expect things like autoexpanding layer boundaries and suchlike to become part of 2.10.x and 3.0.\n\nIncluding babl and GEGL libraries, GIMP surpasses 1 mln lines of code now, also commonly known as \"a shitload of code\".

There could be a UI where the user can see some slides where he/she can see the weight of each project measured by the first module and change them if required. then this information can be sent to the next module \n3. **Payment:** this module can be something like Kickstarter, Patreon and Flattr, and Liberapay, where users charge their wallets and then based on the information from module 2, a monthly amount can be distributed between projects. Some guys have suggested blockchain, I think this is a perfect match for Ethereum.

I'd never installed it prior to leaving port though, and back then, while Navy ships _had_ some internet connectivity, it wasn't easy to come by.  So I found myself with an old CRT-based TV, my PS2, and the keyboard/mouse that came with it.  I forget the exact details, but there was a setup process after putting the disk in that would not render out to a TV, rather they expected me to have an adapter and a monitor, IIRC.  So I ran over to the machine that had internet and started Googling around and I found a playbook that I printing to bring back to my PS2.  The idea is that I would run through that playbook _blind_ to get the system installed and switched the output to the TV out.  I read the whole thing a couple of times, and then made an attempt.  It took about 40 minutes to run through, and I had to figure out it was done with certain steps by watching the flashing yellow disk lights through the  grill of the PS2 to figure out when disk activity had died down.  After my first attempt,  I failed to  actually get the video output configured correctly, so I was left with a black screen and never really knew why.  But, as Linux has taught me, always keep trying, and on my second run through, I nailed it: I had a real Bash console running on my PS2!

They said things during our last renewal that they're denying this time around and pulling the \"we didn't put it in writing\" BS.\n\nEvery quote we got from them either added something we didn't ask for, increase a number we'd already agreed upon, or arbitrarily became more expensive on item X when we reduced the number of Y that we needed. In some cases they were actually double-billing us for things and we'd have to call them out on it because they'd be on seperate pages of the quote.\n\nIt'd be one thing if the support was worth anything, but it's not. The dozen or so tickets we put in were either solved by us or took so long to solve it didn't it was no longer an issue. Any questions to our actual technical contacts referred us back to putting in a ticket. We've even been told by their support to be available between 9am and 3pm India Standard Time (we're in EST) to work with their technician on our problem.\n\nThis whole experience with Redhat has soured my opinion of them so much that I won't recommend them going forward. The thought that I'm actually seriously considering Unbreakable Linux makes me physically ill, but here I am, knowing damn well that Oracle is terrible and their support is terrible but considering it anyways.\n\n The sad part was that prior to this, we were a reliable customer who was constantly increasing our RHEL footprint. We'd just implemented automation with the intent of migrating our remaining CentOS servers to Redhat and becoming a strictly RHEL shop. The RHEL sales team not only turned management, legal, and purchasing against them, but the Linux Engineers who'd been in their corner for the past 18 years.\n\nIt's a damn shame.
