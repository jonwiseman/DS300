This explanation makes no sense at all. The device has a dedicated chip specifically for detecting the word \"Alexa\". It begins recording whatever you say after the keyword to memory until the onboard computer can start up, at which point the recording (and any continued audio) is handed off to the computer. From there it can be sent to Amazon for analysis. If the device is demonstrating false positives, that necessarily means that the dedicated chip is falsely detecting the keyword \"Alexa\". That is a big problem because the entire point of having the chip is to prevent the device from detecting and analyzing vocal samples when the user hasn't explicitly activated it.

It's bad science and most likely was published (in a very good journal at that) as a result of Goodenough's name, who has been in line for a chemistry nobel for a while. Unfortunately it appears he's gone off his rocker a bit, or at least is not paying very close attention to what he's publishing. The strategy for creating a multi-volt cell based on plating an alkali metal on both sides (!) based on some bizarre idea of redox level pinning appears to violate thermodynamics and all sorts of basic electrochemistry rules. In a sense, they're sort of claiming they've made a homeopathic battery. There are 5 citations in the whole paper, 3 of which are self-citations. I'm not going to mince words, it looks like bullshit and no one I've talked to understands how Goodenough's name is on it.\n\nThen to go further, it is also completely ridiculous to claim that this is the first anything with regard to solid state batteries. Room temperature lithium based SSBs have been demonstrated for almost a decade. There are >10 startups in the US working on this technology. Toyota has a massive research effort in this area and has published sulfide-based solid state systems which beat the pants off the devices in this paper even if you believe it. Apple is working on this as well.\n\nIn the end, ceramic processing is too expensive for solid state batteries to be worth it at the moment. Way, way too expensive. You need a <50 micron thick solid electrolyte separator to even match conventional Li ion in terms of energy density, and while this is possible to do, no one knows how to do it at scale right now.\n\nPopular science press is generally complete bullshit.\n\nedit: I describe the problems with the science in more detail in my replies to this post.

Robert arrived at his new house and called the only ISP that services his house, \"BIG ISP Co.\" They sent a technician the next day to set up his Internet service.\n\n\"Okay, I've got your modem plugged in, now I just need to know what services you use.\" The tech looked down at his tablet and cleared his throat, preparing to read from a list. \"Just stop me when you hear a service you would like to use.\" He began to read, \"BIG Movies, BIG Music, BIG Storage.\"\n\n\"No, I don't use those, I didn't have BIG Internet at my last house.\" Robert replied, \"I think it would be faster if I just gave you a list of what I plan to use.\"\n\n\"That might be a problem, especially if your services don't fit in a BIG Internet bundle we already offer.\"\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Well, do you watch movies online from services like Netflix and Amazon Prime?\"\n\n\"Yes, of course I do.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll add the streaming movies package.\" The tech checked off a box, and the monthly price for Robert's quote got higher at the bottom of the his tablet. \"What about television, do you catch up on missed episodes online?\n\n\"Yes, of course! I can't be around all the time when shows are on!\"\n\n\"No problem. I'll add the streaming television package too.\" The tech checked another box, and Robert's quote got higher again. \"How about music, you said you don't use BIG Music, do you want to listen to another internet radio service?\"\n\n\"I have a ton of Spotify playlists! Pretty much one for every occasion.\"\n\n\"Okay, we'll need to add the Music Streaming package, then.\" Another box checked, another increase to Robert's monthly subscription cost. \"Now, how about games, do you use BIG Games to play with friends?\"\n\n\"No, I connect with friends using Discord, and we play all sort of games.\"\n\n\"Discord, huh? VOIP service too, then.\" The tech scrolled through his list looking for VOIP services. He checked the box, and the quote got higher. \"You play games from Steam?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Origin?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"GoG?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\nWith each \"yes,\" the price of Robert's monthly fee went up.\n\n\"Guild Wars?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Battle.net?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Star Citizen?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"Candy Crush?\"\n\n\"No. I don't play Candy Crush.\"\n\n\"Great, you're going to love the savings of not paying for Facebook games.\"\n\n\"I'm not so sure about that.\" Robert looked at the tablet. The long list of third party services had come with service charges that ballooned his rate to twice what he expected to pay. \"My last service provider didn't charge me extra to use Netflix or Spotify or Steam. This seems like a racket!\"\n\n\"Well, sir, you're welcome to use a competitor, then. LARGENET services the other side of town.

All traffic regardless of its source or destination should have the same priority to your internet provider's network.\nExample:\nInternet service provider decides to slow down your connection when you do any sort of online video streaming. Ex, Netflix or YouTube. This forces the consumer to subscribe to a cable packge or a more expensive internet package that does not have this restriction.

This amorphous rule allows the FCC to prevent any practice by an Internet access provider that the FCC believes will \u201cunreasonably disadvantage\u201d an Internet user, application, or content provider. The FCC and net-neutrality advocates correctly recognize that if the agency can monitor and control the distributors of speech, they can shape culture and politics.\n\nThe competitive technology marketplace should be a cause for celebration for a communications and media regulator. Instead, a well-functioning market needed a manufactured crisis \u2014 in this case, illusory \u201cneutrality violations\u201d \u2014 for the agency to reassert power. Title II brings new media firmly inside the regulatory tent.\n\nTitle II rules make the FCC the ultimate arbiter of which tradeoffs and business models are acceptable. Call it innovation by regulatory waiver. So when providers are unsure about whether a new technology or business model \u201cunreasonably\u201d harms some Internet constituency, they can submit those prospective plans to the Commission and pray for an affirmative (and timely) advisory opinion. These advisory opinions border on Kafkaesque. The FCC can decline the request for an opinion, can permit the innovation, or can require more information from the submitting party. These opaque determinations cannot be appealed, and affirmative decisions can be reversed at the agency\u2019s whim.\n\nIf history is any guide, these Title II rules and obligations will drive out smaller ISPs that can\u2019t afford to hire lawyers and lobbyists to interpret the neologisms and incantations that will pour forth from the FCC. The larger carriers, with hallways of attorneys watching the agency\u2019s every move, will muddle through the complexity as they grow more sclerotic, and they may even grow a little larger and more profitable as weaker rivals throw in the towel. Internet and technology companies, used to Silicon Valley\u2019s \u201cmove fast and break things\u201d culture, will increasingly need to lawyer up and ask permission before experimenting with new technology that touches on data transmission.\n\nSome Internet providers may initially fight or test the legal boundaries, but the FCC has ways of breaking defiant firms. The most alarming is that the agency is increasingly using license and transaction approvals to coerce various policies \u2014 like net-neutrality compliance, increasing the number of, say, public-affairs, Spanish-language, and children\u2019s TV shows, and abandonment of editorial control of TV and radio channels \u2014 that it cannot, or will refuse to, enact via formal regulation. In the long run, Internet and technology companies, now FCC supplicants, will have to divert funds from new services and network design to fending off regulatory intrusions and negotiating with the Internet\u2019s new zoning board.\n\nNet neutrality is a wolf in sheep's clothing. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dk53ubh", "post_id": "6mu7aa", "comment": "Net neutrality is great in almost every way, but I'd love to see porn categorically blocked by ISPs.

Once users realized what was happening with their phones slowing down in addition to realizing they don't need/can't afford their new high-end phones, the cheap battery replacement came into play and allowed them to keep their existing phones that are already super-fast and work very well.\n\nMy wife and I have had our 7+ phones since launch in 2017 and they do exactly what we want them to do.  She was down to 88% and I was down to 90% battery life/usage/whatever, so we went a couple of weeks ago and got the batteries replaced since there's nothing the new phones are doing that we feel like we need (plus we don't want to get rid of the fingerprint sensor).\n\nUltimately, I am one of those people who love to have the cutting edge and don't have much issue going and buying the latest and greatest, so I feel like Apple is failing when even I am not swayed."}, {"comment_id": "ed59bo5", "post_id": "ac5av8", "comment": "Aw, that\u2019s awful.

Afterall, jackless iPhone X copycats are all the rage in Asian markets.\n\nInternally, Samsung makes it quite clear that they consider the Galaxy S their main line of phones. Their so-called flagship not just from a marketing and price sense, but from a tech and design sense. All the work and all the bells and whistles go into that year after year because it's the phone they think everyone should have. Not because it's meant as a luxury.\n\nAbout the only phone of Samsung's that fits that bill of 'shit added for luxury's sake' is the Note. At least that's what it has become more recently. A revision of the S featuring a few additions that were either cut from the S for price \\[read: to sell to you later at a markup in a Note, like expanded storage and RAM\\] or because they weren't quite ready for primetime at the S's launch like new processors, cameras, ports, ^(batteries,) software, screens, the rushed in-screen fingerprint reader the Note 9 almost had before Samsung learned Apple nixed it too, etc."}, {"comment_id": "ebkk5j3", "post_id": "a56e7h", "comment": "I WANT A THICKER PHONE SO I CAN HAVE A BIGGER BATTERY.

These sound waves are below the human hearing range of 20Hz-20000Hz (or 20Hz-20kHz) so that the wave lengths are big enough to support a very tiny object between two wave crests (roughly a couple mm apart from each other). The higher pitch (or frequency) you go, the smaller the wave length. You also need a wave with enough amplitude, that is, the difference between the crest and trough of a wave, or as we commonly refer to it, volume. So you need a loud, low pitch to support these objects. When you have this, sort of \u201cpillows\u201d of air are created that would support an object by applying forces above and below it. The greater the amplitude, the greater the force that\u2019s able to be applied. \n\nThe problem arises with the \u201cvolume\u201d or amplitude of the wave. To have a wave strong enough to support an object, it\u2019s amplitude has to be big. Very big. We\u2019re talking over 130dB loud. For reference, that\u2019s how loud it would be standing next to a jet plane as it took off. Imagine the damage prolonged exposure of a sound wave this loud could have on your hearing. That\u2019s the danger of this sort of thing and something we need to keep in mind going forward. \n\nThank you if you\u2019ve read this all the way through, here\u2019s a TL;DR if you didn\u2019t:\n\nTL;DR\nTo levitate an object you need a loud, low sound wave (ultrasonic wave). The kind of wave you need is louder than a jet plane taking off and could have very detrimental effects on your hearing after prolonged exposure\n\n[And here\u2019s a bonus link](https://youtu.be/XpNbyfxxkWE) demonstrating ultrasonic levitation in a similar setup as mine"}, {"comment_id": "duqf8lw", "post_id": "7zpsv4", "comment": "> But its minuscule size belies the power of the 285 microspeakers emitting ultrasonic waves that hold up the light...\n\nThey have a floor and ceiling of speakers to levatate a tiny LED inside of a coil, I don't see how this can be miniaturized or commercialized."}, {"comment_id": "duqf97r", "post_id": "7zpsv4", "comment": "But will be used for advertising..."}, {"comment_id": "duqf9st", "post_id": "7zpsv4", "comment": "Man, I had idea for something really similar (holograms, basically) using small nanomachines with LEDs, but was imagining using something more like a superconductor.

Anyone arguing that the camera will not be used as a tool of hindsight by the public, the media, and the courts is delusional. As an example imagine an officer involved shooting at night in low visibility conditions in which by the officers perception the subject had a gun. The camera which is equipped with night vision clearly shows the subject was only holding a phone or some other object. Unfortunately us human beings are not currently equipped with night vision corneas but no one is going to care about that when the camera clearly shows he or she had no weapon. And as more incidents like this occur it's going to further erode officers confidence that their actions will be judged impartially and it will erode the public  confidence in police officers ability to do their job well without understanding what is actually occurring on a daily basis doing this job.

The more worrying issue, in my opinion, is its use of digital information consumption as a psychological control vector. Time for a thread\n\nThe world is being shaped in large part by two long-time trends: first, our lives are increasingly dematerialized, consisting of consuming and generating information online, both at work and at home. Second, AI is getting ever smarter.\n\nThese two trends overlap at the level of the algorithms that shape our digital content consumption. Opaque social media algorithms get to decide, to an ever-increasing extent, which articles we read, who we keep in touch with, whose opinions we read, whose feedback we get\n\nIntegrated over many years of exposure, the algorithmic curation of the information we consume gives the systems in charge considerable power over our lives, over who we become. By moving our lives to the digital realm, we become vulnerable to that which rules it -- AI algorithms\n\nIf Facebook gets to decide, over the span of many years, which news you will see (real or fake), whose political status updates you\u2019ll see, and who will see yours, then Facebook is in effect in control of your political beliefs and your worldview\n\nThis is not quite news, as Facebook has been known to run since at least 2013 a series of experiments in which they were able to successfully control the moods and decisions of unwitting users by tuning their newsfeeds\u2019 contents, as well as prediction user's future decisions\n\nIn short, Facebook can simultaneously measure everything about us, and control the information we consume. When you have access to both perception and action, you\u2019re looking at an AI problem. You can start establishing an optimization loop for human behavior. A RL loop.\n\nA loop in which you observe the current state of your targets and keep tuning what information you feed them, until you start observing the opinions and behaviors you wanted to see\n\nA good chunk of the field of AI research (especially the bits that Facebook has been investing in) is about developing algorithms to solve such optimization problems as efficiently as possible, to close the loop and achieve full control of the phenomenon at hand. In this case, us\n\nThis is made all the easier by the fact that the human mind is highly vulnerable to simple patterns of social manipulation. While thinking about these issues, I have compiled a short list of psychological attack patterns that would be devastatingly effective\n\nSome of them have been used for a long time in advertising (e.g. positive/negative social reinforcement), but in a very weak, un-targeted form. From an information security perspective, you would call these \"vulnerabilities\": known exploits that can be used to take over a system.\n\nIn the case of the human mind, these vulnerabilities never get patched, they are just the way we work. They\u2019re in our DNA. They're our psychology. On a personal level, we have no practical way to defend ourselves against them.\n\nThe human mind is a static, vulnerable system that will come increasingly under attack from ever-smarter AI algorithms that will simultaneously have a complete view of everything we do and believe, and complete control of the information we consume.\n\nImportantly, mass population control -- in particular political control -- arising from placing AI algorithms in charge of our information diet does not necessarily require very advanced AI. You don\u2019t need self-aware, superintelligent AI for this to be a dire threat.\n\nSo, if mass population control is already possible today -- in theory -- why hasn\u2019t the world ended yet? In short, I think it\u2019s because we\u2019re really bad at AI. But that may be about to change. You see, our technical capabilities are the bottleneck here.\n\nUntil 2015, all ad targeting algorithms across the industry were running on mere logistic regression. In fact, that\u2019s still true to a large extent today -- only the biggest players have switched to more advanced models.\n\nIt is the reason why so many of the ads you see online seem desperately irrelevant. They aren't that sophisticated. Likewise, the social media bots used by hostile state actors to sway public opinion have little to no AI in them. They\u2019re all extremely primitive. For now.\n\nAI has been making fast progress in recent years, and that progress is only beginning to get deployed in targeting algorithms and social media bots. Deep learning has only started to make its way into newsfeeds and ad networks around 2016. Facebook has invested massively in it\n\nWho knows what will be next. It is quite striking that Facebook has been investing enormous amounts in AI research and development, with the explicit goal of becoming a leader in the field. What does that tell you? What do you use AI/RL for when your product is a newsfeed?\n\nWe\u2019re looking at a powerful entity that builds fine-grained psychological profiles of over two billion humans, that runs large-scale behavior manipulation experiments, and that aims at developing the best AI technology the world has ever seen. Personally, it really scares me\n\nIf you work in AI, please don't help them. Don't play their game. Don't participate in their research ecosystem. Please show some conscience\"\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dwbdc35", "post_id": "87a8ji", "comment": "People panic over Facebook, but think of the amount of info Google has through their search engine,  chrome browser, YouTube, Gmail, Google maps usage, etc"}, {"comment_id": "dwbbzdg", "post_id": "87a8ji", "comment": "Did we not know this already?

I'm thinking, we'll damn this sucks, I'll have to return the replacement when I get back home to the USA. Fast forward to this past Friday night, just 2 days before my return flight. My wife says, honey, the FAA just banned the note 7 on flights to and from the US. I sort of brush it off, mostly out of disbelief. Then I get the message on my phone a few hours later, and it feels more serious now.  What do I do, how am I going to get this phone home? So I call Samsung, and oh boy THEY HAVE NO CLUE WHAT THEY ARE DOING AND WHAT TO TELL ME.  They basically give me the guidance to return the phone at a corporate store in Colombia. I think, ok, this will be tough in Spanish, but ok.  I go to the Samsung Corporate store that morning, and bring an in-law that lives in Bogota and is fluent in spanish just in case. Guess what, They also have no clue what's going on AND REFUSE TO EXCHANGE OR REFUND ME.  Now I'm pissed, and I call Samsung back explaining what happened. How am I supposed to get home, what do I do with the phone? I can't ship it, there is no ground shipping to the US from Colombia. So here's the new guidance, and it's utterly UNBELIEVABLE.. Take your phone to the airport, try to give it to the airline, if they don't want it.. throw it in the trash. Yes ladies and gentleman, that is Samsung's solution, throw it in the trash. I had an open ticket, all I need to do is email them the receipt, the boarding pass, and the IMEI number of the phone, and I get my refund. So there's a Brand new Samsung Galaxy Note 7 in a landfill somewhere in Bogota if anyone is interested..   \n\n-Sent with my Samsung Galaxy Note 3\n\nEdit - a little bit of exaggeration in this post, instead of trashing it I left the phone with an in-law there in Bogota before she left the airport.

Customer support said we couldn't do a \"loaner\" and that they were trying to move people to the device they intend to stick with.

Literally the only one so I had to choose something else which means s7, s7 edge, or iPhones. Except they're all limited availability, the left over SKUs that other people didnt want. Ugly colors, smallest storage sizes, etc. I ended up with an iPhone 7 after having android devices since the g1 came out. Couldn't even get the 7+ which I would prefer for the added camera features, screen size, resolution, etc.\n\nWhat I wasn't thinking of is taking advantage of the standard return policy which I may end up doing.

There's a model that's like, 90% as good, and costs like 1/6th the price, and that's the EOS-1n. Not as many as AF points, doesn't focus as fast, but it's rugged as hell, and good enough for what almost every user of it is going to do.\n\nGet into shooting film, it's awesome! You can develop black and white film at home with a minimal investment, and companies like Ilford seem to have no interest in ceasing their film production!

The exact same model and type of car appears to be parked outside of Cici's house in April 2017 when Google Street View were there, the wheels and the colour are a total match. https://i.imgur.com/cNC88DA.jpg https://i.imgur.com/N12VvsM.jpg\nFurthermore, take note of the black and white interior design and ornaments. If you jump back to the original video and look at the interior of the second thief's car, it's once again a total match. https://i.imgur.com/l0ud34T.jpg\nThis is already very fucking suspicious -- either the person who stole the package was coincidentally parked right outside the house of the victim they would steal from in a year's time just as a Google Street View car was rolling by or Cici or one of her neighbours have the exact same make and model of car as the thief with identical ornaments.\nBut it gets worse.\n7:29 -- The third package thief is that lady that everyone keeps dunking on for her reaction. Now, what if I told you that this lady was actually Cici's neighbour? Because she is.\nIf we go back to that initial Google Street View shot of Cici's house from earlier, we notice these large cypress trees on the left https://i.imgur.com/TWj9M50.jpg. Here's a clearer shot of Cici's neighbours house where those cypress trees are https://i.imgur.com/FvtwaIV.jpg\n7:48 -- Now if we compare this to the brief shots we get to see of the third thief's house in the original video, you can make out that once again it's a total match. There's no way that these are different houses. The garbage bins, trees, brick of the house are total matches with each other.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/0kJd9By.jpg\nhttps://i.imgur.com/BLys3jN.jpg\nSo in addition to the matching cars at Cici's place, one of the thieves also managed to be her neighbour.\nAnother curious detail are these matching stickers on both the Ford F-150 (we know this to be Cici's from the earlier shot showing it in her driveway) and the second thief's supposed black hatchback. They aren't any kind of neighbourhood parking permit as all the other cars in the neighbourhood don't have them. Presumably this means that these are both Cici's cars. https://i.imgur.com/lHk7gJJ.jpg https://i.imgur.com/PxxKOMi.jpg\nEdit: That only leaves two conclusions:\na) this video was staged\nb) Cici has the exact same make and model of car as one of her package thieves with the same dashboard ornaments. And the other package thief has actually been the person living next door to her.\nEDIT2: holy shit, actual conspiracy territory. The old version with the third clip of the lady in the house has been flat out removed from the video by stealth. Go check the clip yourself, it's been shortened from 11:10 to 10:36. There is no mechanism for YouTubers to edit clips after they've been posted while still keeping the views/likes/dislikes, so presumably someone at YouTube has had their bell rung. Google cache is still reflecting the old timestamp though https://i.imgur.com/tpBmsz7.png\nYou can still see the original clip on reuploads https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mmZgQxBrWWw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q3bH1yQ6KfQ\nEDIT2.5: Evidence from the Wayback Machine and Google Cache that the clip length has been manipulated without changing the URL\nold https://web.archive.org/web/20181219071300/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoxhDk-hwuo\nnew https://web.archive.org/web/20181220093629/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoxhDk-hwuo"}, {"comment_id": "ec5n07o", "post_id": "a7o4kv", "comment": "That is quite possibly the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.

In this case it's about 0% as cool as the title sounds. The project overall sounds interesting, but the solar aspect of it is just normal and boring. \n\nFor starters, they say that this skin only requires 20 nanowatts of power per square centimeter. Modern solar cells can generate about 20,000,000 nanowatts of power per square centimeter, so powering it via solar cells is monumentally unimpressive.\n\nSecondly, although they talk about this eliminating the need for a battery and therefore lowering the weight of the prosthetic, as we all know you need to be able to store the energy that you get from the solar cells somewhere. That somewhere would be a battery. They even say later on \"Dr Dahiya said the skin had easily generated more power than it needed but it was currently not possible to store the energy. He said the team were already looking at ways to divert unused energy into batteries, allowing it to be used when required.\" So, as you would expect, using solar power does nothing to eliminate the necessary battery.\n\nAlso keep in mind that this is just the skin. That's why the power requirements are so tiny, because it's just powering a couple of little sensors. Everything that powers the arm itself is not powered by solar cells because you'd need to carry around a giant panel with you everywhere if you wanted to do that.\n\nEssentially what this boils down to is \"someone used solar cells as they are intended to produce power for an incredibly tiny device.\" That's it. I mean, props to people for working on this stuff, and even this specific project which sounds somewhat interesting in other aspects. But this entire article is just about how they used solar power. That's like a review of the new iPhone only talking about how they used lithium batteries and how much better lithium batteries are than traditional NiMH/NiCad batteries. Yes, we get it.

Sorry, your specific one might not be here for another month.\n\n* They started off telling us to quote about three days for shipments and now it's been about two weeks and we're still dry for the individual orders.\n\n* The first couple days the iPhone 6 was saying, again, that they could have a battery in three days. Later that week telling us to quote customers up to three months??\n\n* If you get lucky enough we might get a shipment of ONE consignment battery and if you just happen to walk up, it's yours. No priority for orders that have been on hold for weeks already because it ties the ordered battery to their phone's serial number.\n\n* The 5s, 5c, and 5 will still ring up as $29 right now, at least for us.

I think people are blowing this out of proportion and have unrealistic expectations for a phone to last 4 to 5 years. To put this in terms of a computer. (Which phones are basically pocket computers) You buy a laptop, and 4 years later after using it and charging it THOUSANDS of times, dropping it and using it every single day, you will expect to replace the battery and see slower performance in most cases. People need to understand that they are buying a phone with certain capabilities at the time of purchase.  Technology changes programs require more processing power, software has more multi tasking capabilities etc. You can\u2019t expect your phone to perform at the same pace as a brand new product.

First off last I checked you don't actually touch your computer to interact with it, you touch keyboard, mouse or a touch screen. It seems to me the only part you really need to worry about being contaminated with germs are the parts that you regularly touch.\n\nOn top of that, if they aren't using much processing power just to look up patient info and do some basic data entry. So just computers basically do nothing 99% of the time and the other 1% of the time they have to do something it requires almost no significant Computing resources.\n\nSo that being the case, you have two more easy options. One is Simply don't worry about the exact longevity of the computer system, just making it very compartmentalize and easy to replace. This way you don't wind up doing something silly like creating expensive computers for doctors offices that barely do anything. A 150 computer has more than enough power these days to run Medical front end software.\n\nThe 2nd option is to use thin clients or modern \"terminal\" computers where offset the need for local computing resources and gain far superior central management and security practices.\n\nI don't see a need for \"germicide\" resistant electronics. It makes more sense to make the parts that get dirty easy to protect, replace and/or wash. \n\nIt seems to me it's somebody's just trying to create an expensive niche market.\n\nIf you have a specially High demands for a super germ-free environment, then I guess you should be using sealed Electronics with passive Cooling, in other words don't use Electronics with a bunch of fans and vents where germs can get down inside easily.\n\nIt's not hard to make a computer that just dissipates heat through a sealed case, especially when their computer is never being used for any kind of demanding work. Beyond that I think simple things like keyboard covers and maybe mouse and touch screen covers are more practical.\n\nNothing has really ever proven to control germs better than scrubbing."}, {"comment_id": "dv9g951", "post_id": "82bmx9", "comment": "So, the computers are no longer affected by the germicide?

And the fact that even if I have a Bluetooth headphone, I have to remember to charge it/set it up. And also to people saying how great expensive Bluetooth headphones are... I did mentioned I lost two headphones, right? I like the option of having wired headphones. Good quality Sennheiser/Sony ones at $50. No fuss, dinosaur goodness.

The sunset earlier than I had expected, I was young and dumb. I put myself in a dangerous situation that I never would again. I thought I would get back before it got too dark, but by the time I had a few miles left; it was too late. \n\nOne of the most humbling moments was when I walked by a water tower, and then 30 minutes later I walked by it again. In sheer panic, I was underprepared. I had lights and my bag; but not equipment to sleep overnight. My phone battery was low. We got off the path at one point and started seeing big bright red marks on the trees essentially saying, \u201cyou fucked up and went too far off the trail, go back or you\u2019ll probably fall off a cliff\u201d.\n\nOnce back on the trail, my partner would walk the 100 yards to each marker, give me the okay, and then I\u2019d walk to the next marker, and stand there. We did this for a few miles. I learned my lesson the hard way. Now I keep emergency blankets, ponchos, batteries for my lights, etc. even for a small day hike. \n\nI could not IMAGINE being a young boy with his dog in the woods, in the complete and utter darkness. In 30 degree weather or lower. It makes me stomach sink. I\u2019m so glad he was found. I\u2019m glad he had his dog with him to help keep him a little warm, and a little safer.

Also has a button on it's case to talk to the next pi in this list to instruct it to arm my alarm, handy for when I'm leaving the house.\n* the very first pi, 256mb of ram, controls my cat flap to lock and unlock at sunrise/sunset and manually. It also arms and disarms my alarm system.\n* another pi a+ which controls my rabbit feeder, so they will get fed if I'm not at home although I have to login in on my phone to trigger the feed. it also points my webcam to point at the rabbits where the food drops so I can check it didn't break or get stuck.\n* raspberry pi 3.

I've gotten myself a Pi some time ago but all I did with it was run linux and learned about ssh, dhcp, vnc and some command line which was definitely worth the endeavour and got me more into linux. What I also tried to do was run openVPN but it failed twice while I was remotely connected to it. It locked up and had to be rebooted. I asked on the pi subreddit and on youtube if anybody had the same problem but didn't really get any response. I concluded that the raspberry pi is not a great device to run a vpn, and there are probably better alternatives. Also, for an htpc i'd rather use a small x86 device like an intel nuc or any other small pc with an SSD and a proper amount of memory, and I'm really not into the whole retro pie mini arcade/ emulation craze. \nBut the biggest letdown for me was that I found out that the device is not actually open source as I was let to believe.

This would be ambliogenic (causing amblyopia), which is like projecting a 1080p image onto a 128x128 grid of pixels, no matter how well you focus it, the hardware (striate cortex) isn't able to resolve it any better.  \n\nAnywho, it's great that these devices are able to help, but I always find issue with how sensationalized these articles make it out to be.  Similar things with the retinal implants (Argus II etc) and these devices.  \n\nOne of the coolest applications for truly blind people is image recognition/spatial identification and verbalizing \"Doorway closed 5' in front of you\". Computer vision is doing some great things to help the visually impaired."}, {"comment_id": "du8vpz2", "post_id": "7xjz68", "comment": ">Legally Blind\n\n\"Do you have a license for that disability?\"\n\nUhh...

My mom is legally blind with degenerative eye failure. She was poisoned by a military spill of agent orange into the ground water in Camp Lejeune North Carolina when she was a teenager. Her condition leaves her with terrable vision, and she lacks the ability to see worth a damn most of the time, unless what she's looking at is inlarged and right in front of her face. It's really bad. My dad did some research and looked into these glasses. They seemed like a great idea, but as the article says, it comes with a 10,000 dollar price tag. It's hard to put any price on the ability to see, but my mom has worked hard in her life and has never let her vision problem stand in her way. She hates the idea of looking like a freak and she was against the idea up front. That being the case, she decided to try these out. What they told us is that if you want to try them, you have to come to one of their centers for the blind to even try them, an I home test costs 500 dollars for a trial. That's pretty high, all things considered. When I tried them out myself I was amazed at how underwhelming they were. The resolution is medeocre, the fit is bad, they fall off your face if you look down, they are made of super cheap materials, they don't focus well, even with no prescription and they have a short battery life. That's it? For 10 grand? What? My solution for her was to get a Samsung note 8 and an oculus gear vr. For less than 10% of the cost, the comfort, form factor, battery life, build quality, resolution and camera are unbelievably better. The problem is the software. The passthrough camera works OK, but it lacks functionality. I did a little research and there is a Korean company that developed an app called Relumino that blows that Canadian bullshit away. It actually brought me to tears when my mom tried it out and she could actually, for the first time in my life, could read the signs on the stores near by. I was pissed that the esight was so bad, but the ability for the gear vr to work as well as it does was amazing. If you bothered to read this far and would like help or would like to know more, let me know and I can help you walk through my process. \n\nTLDR: Note 8 + gear vr + Relumino blows this 10k piece of junk out of the water for less than 1/10 the price.

We're talking about average users here) So lets say you end up at 40% at the end of the day. That's now 25 months before your battery is consumed (80%).

That's more than the payment period and upgrade cycle if you fully pay out your two year payment plan. \n\nIs that unfair to people who don't upgrade that frequently? Yes and no. Companies try to make products that are exactly ride the line of their customer's expectations. Since most customers upgrade every 2 years or less, they're meeting the needs of the majority of their customers. Should they make battery replacement cheaper? Absolutely. If they don't? Quit buying their products. Quit rewarding companies for screwing you over. Just stop it. Stop buying their shit. That's the same for Samsung, LG, Microsoft, Ford, VW, etc. If you buy a car and the company lies to you about how fuel efficient the car is, they're costing you money over the life of the vehicle. Don't buy a VW next time. If you were expecting your phone's battery to last 1000 charge cycles and it lasts 500, don't buy that phone the next time.

By the 2nd click it lists repair costs for every single iPhone. \n\nFor comparison, the Google Pixel website doesn't even let you access support information from a computer. You have to do it from a Google Pixel. There are no support articles available.

This means if you use your phone's battery every day scaling 100% of use for the entire day then you will have charged it exactly 365 times a year (365 cycles). This means someone who uses 200% of their battery every day can run up on 500 cycles in less than a year. Yeah your capacity will diminish as it does with EVERY SINGLE BATTERY TO EVER EXIST. CAPACITY DIMINISHES WITH USE. USE LESS OFTEN = BETTER BATTERY THIS HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE CASE FOR EVERY BATTERY EVER.\n\nAlso, what determines that the battery drains quicker and quicker with time? Capacity (and so many more things but lets keep this simple). What determines capacity? Usage (and other things too still...). What determines usage? How often you use the phone and HOW you use it. So, why is it that you just claim that users will automatically have less battery life on newer iPhones?!??! How do you have any idea what anyone else does on their phone let alone how that particularly impacts their phone's specific battery?

I'm NOT an Apple fan but I'm tired of these outlandish misleading articles wording things in nitpicked ways to convince people of a non-existent problem. If you don't like the phone then DONT BUY IT.

That's how Li Pol batteries work - they have a limited lifetime during which they degrade. It's not the mobile vendor's fault. The only thing you can hold them responsible for is failing to observe your consumer rights.\n\nAlso worth noting: every time I've bought a new iPhone I've been able to sell the old one for half to three-quarters what I paid for it.

They only confirmed my thoughts, plus introduced other concerns like this battery life issue. \n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft releases updates to their already innovative Surface Pro and the brand new Surface Studio. I fantasized about owning one of those but being so engrained in the Apple ecosystem for work I knew that it would mean unacceptable loss of productivity while I made \"the switch\".\n\nAlas, I went to the Refurbished section of the Apple website and picked up a high-end previous generation 15\" MacBook Pro that not only cost $1000 less than the new generation, but also out performs it in nearly every test.\n\nGoing forward, I don't think I will be buying another Apple laptop again, ending my 15 years of not only brand loyalty but rabid fandom.\n\nFarewell Apple, and thanks for all the fish."}, {"comment_id": "dbu0dua", "post_id": "5l99dg", "comment": "I have used macs since 1985. I have given a lot of thought to whether I want to continue to use them. I think Apple has been mercenary in it's evolution of technology to further enrich their company at the expense of the good of the consumer.  The CD/DVD was a perfectly useful tool. You could use the media without having to take up your storage space. And they were cheap. You could even check them out for free at the library. Removing it they drove immense amounts of traffic to the iTunes store and created huge revenues and a power position. But the did it to \"make the laptop thinner.\" Then you had to keep the media on your computer. Their solution was the iCloud. As a friend says, it's not a cloud, it is somebody else's computer. Your data is out there. And they charge you to keep it. Every fricken month.  The iPhone eliminating headphones was silly.  I have a ton of perfectly serviceable headphones. They cost a dollar a pair or so. They aren't beats but when listening to a podcast at 2x speed they don't need to be. Some I got for free. Their solution is to eliminate the headphone jack \"to make the phone waterproof\" but will in reality replace an inexpensive and serviceable solution wth an expensive one.

They didn't want to send me home because they couldn't get my heart rate down under 105 or so resting. I said I just don't like hospitals, and I want to get home.

All of this was prompted by my being able to verify symptoms/feelings with relevant data that I could collect and bring to my appointments. \n\nThe sleep tracker has been great too because it's supported what I learned from a sleep study--that I'm not getting the adequate amount of \"deep sleep,\" no matter how many hours I sleep. At least now, I can take note of the nights I get the most of it and try to find a common denominator that may help me have more good nights and maybe even make connections about what might be contributing to it.\n\nEssentially, it's been good for both prompting me to seek a diagnosis, as well as for monitoring and managing my symptoms, and it's given my doctor a concrete reference to go on--rather than me just saying, \"I felt weird at 3pm,\" there's an added, \"which is when my hr dropped to 50bpm.\" And it helps me feel more in control of my own health and more knowledgeable about my body and what different feelings might mean."}, {"comment_id": "dpvol0p", "post_id": "7d45p8", "comment": "This comment will probably get haters, but the Microsoft Band 2 was able to do all of this as well with all the sensors that was included in it.\n\nI used it to track my quality of sleep when I had it.

Until recently their laptops improved consistently, culminating in the 2013 Macbook Air I'm using now -- by far my favorite laptop I've ever owned (and I've had several PC laptops along the way too). OSX and its bundled apps got dramatically better with each release -- faster, more stable, and more featureful. Even iOS was going in the right direction.\n\nBut it just isn't like that any more. I am underwhelmed by the last several releases of OSX, the bundled apps have stagnated, become buggy, and taken terrible design paths. The hardware updates have been disappointing with important features going downhill (no magsafe? dongle city?) and useless features adding needless complexity (force touch? touchbar?).\n\nFrom about 2005 to 2014 it felt like Apple had created the hardware and software I'd always dreamed of in the 90s. Everything was possible and a pleasure to use. But I guess they couldn't keep going that direction. All their latest stuff bears the marks of sloppy engineering and questionable design choices.\n\nThey'll continue to succeed as a company for the foreseeable future, because they're well above the line needed to keep the average user from running away. But it's sad for people that push their computers to the limits -- it's apparent that things aren't as tight as they used to be, and probably never will be again.\n\n\\* **edit:** Apple *user*, dammit."}, {"comment_id": "dggqjon", "post_id": "669shi", "comment": "Misleading headline.

I got to try a tech demo at a microsoft office in NYC and stuff and they offered three demos.\n\nThe first was you were in an empty room with a single chair, but when you used the hololens the room transformed. TVs, computers, speakers, dogs, planes and a trex filled the room, all intractable and easy to get.\n\nThe second was a demo in again an empty room. This was an actual game where the walls broke open and machines that looked like sentinals from the Matrix filled the room and you needed to dodge the blasts while shooting back. Was fun.\n\nThe third and probably most relevant was a tech demo for a car presentation. It allowed one person to lead a presentation and manipulate the room and the others could see. The car was shown in full size, see through so you can see the interior, it went through its safety features and it felt like i was on a highway watching the cars automatic brakes kick it. Last it allowed us to customize the car to our liking and we each saw something different, what we created.\n\nI know they had issues with the hololens needing to be a specific distance from your eyes etc, but i imagine hard connecting it to a helmet may make it more secure and usable.\n\nPlus, military money can help develop AVR for public use at a cheap price so hell yea."}, {"comment_id": "eaq37ly", "post_id": "a1ggua", "comment": "When your fighting the enemy and you kill enough of them you hear \u201ckilimanjaro\u201d"}, {"comment_id": "eaqeknw", "post_id": "a1ggua", "comment": "Do we know when this will have a retail release?

It had some wifi connectivity issues early on, but those were resolved after firmware and software updates back then. \n\nAnyhoo, it stopped charging a couple weeks ago--I'd plug the charging cable in and it wouldn't light up and the Surface wasn't indicating it was charging. I did all the troubleshooting I could, but ended up bring it to a Microsoft store for further troubleshooting. They declared the charging port was dead. I was out of warranty so it would be $600 to replace the entire machine. They don't offer part replacement, just entire machine replacement. (Which is pretty BS, since you know they'll just fix the old one and sell it as a refurb).\n\nI got a quote from a local repair shop: $180 to replace the charging port but they warned that the screen will almost certainly break during the repair, so if/when that happens it would be $500 total to replace the screen & charging port. \n\nSo I started watching videos about Surface Pro 3 teardowns and part replacing, and it was pretty clear: the screen is going to break if you try to open. Even these guys online who make DIY fix it videos for a living were cracking the screen trying to get it open. Oof.\n\nSo my options were: $600 entire machine replacement, $500 (probably) third party repair shop, or $30 for a replacement charging port and DIYing knowing that I may also have to spend $200 on a replacement screen as well.\n\nSo I went the DIY route and, man, the screen broke apart like brittle hard candy. It was a total disaster.\n\nBut I knew that I would probably break the screen during opening it, so I wasn't too broken up about it (the screen was though, heh).\n\nReplaced the charging port with the replacement from eBay and sonofabitch, that was indeed the problem. Charged without issue after the replacement. So I ordered a replacement screen overnighted and swapped in the new screen the next day. \n\nEverything is now in perfect working order, and I ended up spending about $280 (screen + rush shipping, charging port, various tool kits, and double sided adhesive) to DIY it myself, instead of $600, $500, or maybe more for a replacement laptop. This all happened to me the past couple weeks, just put the replacement screen in on Thursday night.\n\nSurfaces are not meant to be opened. The screen WILL break, and it will be a nightmare. That said, it IS possible to get in there and replace things, if you're willing to replace the screen too. \n\nFelt really good, actually, to DIY it and be remarkably succesfully.

Secondly, it was explained to me in training that LTE stands for Long Term Evolution. Meaning that when 4G was released it was barely better than 3G and the networks knew they needed something that could be upgraded easily with the times and wouldn't cost as much. Thus spawned the E portion or Long Term Evolution.\n\nIt is a long term plan to keep evolving the hardware that distributes the 4G signal. There isn't any real limit as to what 4G LTE can become. \n\nThat is how it was explained to me. So when I saw people getting hyped for a 5G network I instantly knew it was BS. It would just be an upgrade to existing hardware for the LTE network. There is no need for a 5G until you need to change out the Evolution portion of the network, which based on the fact that LTE coverage is still lacking in a lot of places and you have things like bandwidth to account for as well, it seems like it'll still be a long time off before we see anything resembling a true 5G. As to what a 5G will mean to the consumer I can't say. \n\nMy best guess is it will be a stronger signal in places that 4G has a hard time reaching at comparable speeds or maybe faster. But ahain it would be difficult for any company to do this without first purchasing the bandwidth.\n\nOn that note I'd like to also say that T-Mobile CEO John Legere once did an announcement at my work building that we were expanding our network. It had previously been announced we were cutting back on 3G availability to focus on 4G and LTE meaning we were opening up more of our available bandwidth. When I asked our CEO in a Q&A he did, how the cutting of 3G was going to affect how we acclimated our bandwidth he looked at me blankly and said we weren't cutting our bandwidth. We were expanding it for our 4G and LTE. I had to try and explain to him how bandwidth work and you can't just invent more bandwidth for your network, that it was already announced in the company that we were cutting 3G to free bandwidth.\n\nHe still didn't understand. So while T-Mobile CEO talks a good game, he also doesn't seem to know how his own network works."}, {"comment_id": "edmi2jp", "post_id": "advo7w", "comment": "I had to scroll 6+ menus to cancel data collection.

Samsung, Huawei, Xiaomi and LG are among the first few tech companies that have emerged thus far with 5G foldable smartphones. \n\nWith 5G, there are many added capabilities and benefits that come with the territory, such as: fast speed internet access, better communications network- that will reduce the likelihood of a dropped call, and of course, the ability to fast-stream 4K on your mobile device. Still to come in 2019 are competing 5G smartphones such as the Oneplus 7/ Oneplus 7T, the Oppo 5G Flagship, Honor 5G phone, and Sony. In addition, it is believed that Nokia may also release a 5G phone sometime this year, but that the new Apple phone anticipated to be released later this year may not be 5G.\n\nFor several decades, American companies have been outsourcing their technology to Asia due to cost-efficient manufacturing. It has been said that those same Asian based companies who were once copy-cats are now innovators.\n\nHowever, sales in the West may not reach market expectations due to a few PEST factors. Here are a few reasons why I believe these tech companies may not reach their desired sales goal for 2019.\n\nPolitical\nArguably, President Donald Trump has committed some political blunders since being sworn into office. As we already know, the impending trade war between China and the United States has been dragging on for more than a year. Despite being a self-proclaimed excellent negotiator, President Trump\u2019s efforts to come to an agreement so far with Congress, China and North Korea have each resulted in an impasse. Furthermore, the arrest of the Meng Wanzhou daughter of Huaweii\u2019s founder (at the behest of the U.S government) in Canada has also caused a stir in diplomatic relationships between the United States and China.\n\nEconomic\nLast year, Chinese companies suffered significant stock market losses which may have been attributed to both the devaluation of their currency and political relationships with Washington. In 2018, major indexes in both Shanghai and Shenzhen encountered annual losses of more than 24 percent. In fact, the situation was so reprehensible that last year\u2019s outcome proved to be the worst since the financial crisis of 2008.\n\nSocial\nAsian technology has been stigmatized over the years for being cheap imitations of western technology. Products such as smartphones, television sets and other consumer electronics have been for the most part receiving high demand in the west, but these devices have only been attractive to consumers simply because of low prices. Alternatively, these aforementioned new 5G smartphones are twice as expensive as 4G smartphones, and would therefore drastically raise monthly fees and/or take the average consumer many more years to pay off through a client service agreement with a respective mobile network carrier. \n\nTechnological\nThere are some concerns as to why American tech companies have not released 5G technology. Presumably, there are some health and safety risks associated with 5G. For instance, scientists have assessed that 5G may cause cancer due to the harmful radiation effects acquired from cellphone usage. In any event, this correlation between 5G and radiation may prove to be accurate inasmuch as there have been reports implicating flashes from Japanese television cartoons to seizures among young children and adults.\n"}, {"comment_id": "dv1gta6", "post_id": "819d95", "comment": "I mean it\u2019s pretty cool.

I plug in the included EarPods and listen. If I want to plug into my car I use a USB to lighting cable, and I can charge and listen to music. \n\nI understand the whole argument about having an expensive pair of headphones and Bluetooth being shitty, but the dongle is included and replacements are cheap so I guess I don\u2019t understand the big issue. \n\nJust my opinion, please don\u2019t downvote me to hell.
