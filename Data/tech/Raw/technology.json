[{"comment_id": "dr46kzm", "post_id": "7j6kn4", "comment": "There's actually a way to force the Senate to vote on saving net neutrality. It's called the Congressional Review Act. Under this law, Congress can block any agency decision by passing a resolution of disapproval in both chambers. This resolution cannot be filibustered in the Senate and only 30 senators need to sign a petition to force a vote.\n\nEd Markey has already said he'll introduce a CRA resolution: https://twitter.com/ACLU_Mass/status/940251501695590405\n\nSusan Collins supports net neutrality. If Doug Jones wins tomorrow, that would mean only one other Republican senator would need to flip for the bill to pass the Senate. So... if you live in Alabama and care about net neutrality, you should definitely vote.  \n\nEdit: To clarify though, Trump could still veto the resolution and it would also have to pass the House. But this is a way to force every senator to take a position on this issue before next year's midterm elections. And who knows what will happen if it builds enough momentum. Elected politicians are a lot more responsive to public opinion than FCC commissioners are.  \n\nThe CRA was actually passed by Newt Gingrich and the Republicans in the 1990s to make it easier to kill regulations. But it applies as much to an agency decision to repeal a regulation as it does to enact one. It sure would be deliciously ironic to use the CRA to save net neutrality. If you're curious about the CRA, you can read more here: https://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43992.pdf"}, {"comment_id": "dr48bus", "post_id": "7j6kn4", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "dr440c7", "post_id": "7j6kn4", "comment": "Build your local meshnet!

Capitalism is why changes and a light are starting to appear when it comes to video games and the industry. When you hand things over to the government that's where it really has a chance to be untouchable and go to crud. If companies try and pull this stuff that preach doom and gloom constantly about net neutrality even though almost none of it has ever been tried and is all hypothetical you make changes with your wallet and the companies will come around. Kind of how every cell carrier now carries an unlimited plan again. They tried pulling some crap. Smaller companies took advantage of it in Sprint and T-Mobile and wouldn't you know att and Verizon had to play along or bleed subscribers terribly. I worked for Verizon for the two years before they went to unlimited plans. They were freaking out as more and more people switched carriers.

Also still wondering how the FCC was able to drop investigation into zero-rating policies while net neutrality was still in force.\n\n--------------\n\nEDIT 2\n\n/u/whomad1215 \n\n> Revealing IP addresses, when you have to publicly put your full name and address to comment, is somehow a privacy concern.\n\nBest point in this thread.  The FCC is only protecting the privacy of impersonators.\n\n----------------------\n\nEDIT: More gems,\n\n> (1) The logs would also provide detailed information about how the Commission protects the security of its electronic comment system and other information assets, including how the Commission protects its commercial cloud server from disruptive attacks. The confidentiality of this information is critical to ensuring the security and integrity of the Commission's rulemaking processes. If third parties were to obtain access to the Commission's security protocols, it could provide a roadmap for hackers to create the very disruptions to federal rulemakings that you seek to prevent.\n\n**No private website could ever use this argument against a state's attorney general**.  Perhaps the FCC has some ground as a federal agency not turning over data to a state, I don't know, however, the above is just laughably meaningless and page filler at best.\n\nOn top of that, any serious security researcher will tell you open source is the best way to secure a system.  Computer security isn't like public security and I'm starting to believe our government may never learn that.  You'd expect the nerd Pai to know that, but of course, he's just a nerd for show.\n\n> (2) when individuals have contacted the Commission to complain that a comment was falsely filed in their name, the Commission has responded by inviting them to file a statement to that effect in the public record\n\nHow nice!  So all those dead people who commented just need to possess someone, fill out a form, and then the FCC will remove their comment.  As for all those people who never use a computer and will never know about the identity theft, well, the FCC simply doesn't care to deal with those.\n\n> The Commission is confident that the process followed in this proceeding will result in an order that is both consistent with law and **furthers the public interest**.\n\nThis fires me up.  The letter is so blatantly a complete lie and distraction.  I hope these men get what they deserve for their \"service\" to the country."}, {"comment_id": "drccisb", "post_id": "7k7z00", "comment": "The FCC is not above the law, and ignoring FOIA or other requests is a good way to have formal charges raised. \n\nI hope the NY AG keeps turning the heat up, as well as other states.

When clicking your AG it brings you to a page with a phone number. Call! Call your AG!\n\nDon't like and share, don't gift gold people, don't just post about it. CALL your ag and encourage support and unity in the pursuit! I think I'll call mine. How about you?\n\n\nEdit2:\n\n\nSince Reddit loves templates and people want to know what to say I want to make a point:\n\n\nI am not your voice. Don't use a provided script. Speak from the heart. Why does the internet matter to you? to your business? how will you be impacted personally?\nStart a discussion. Talk about the role of the internet in everyday life. Talk about the NYAG  Eric Schneiderman's investigation into the Fraudulent comments. Talk about how you as a resident of the state wish to see similar actions and express your full support behind them. Express frustration with the FCC's current actions. \n\n\nWas your name used fraudulently? Let them know! Give consent to have your name utilized.  Be infuriated if you feel violated.\n\n\nThey need to hear passion and reason in your voice. You're calling to appeal to their senses and invigorate them to participate. This is so much more powerful than any template email.\n\n\nEdit 3:\n\n\nThank /u/Pendley/ for this which has provided us with this helpful link https://ag.ny.gov/fakecomments\n\n\nUse it to check if your name was used fraudulently. Look for your relatives, your friends. See someone? Start a discussion. \n\nDoes your AG already plan to sue? great! call them and let them know you support them.\n\nThink they won't sign on? Even greater reason to call and put the pressure on.\n\nA real phone call and a real conversation is a powerful thing. An e-mail is better than nothing, but a call is 100 e-mails.\n\nEdit 4:\nSomeone gilded me! It's pretty cool and thank you, but if you have a few extra dollars? I'd really appreciate donations to the EFF which will go so much farther for this cause.

What they're doing is pretty standard operating procedure when it comes to these sorts of cases.  They see a domain they don't like and use the scare tactic of threatening letters with lots of words like \"infringement\" and \"illegal\" thrown in to make you cave.  That doesn't mean you have broken the law, though.\n\nHowever, your case is unique because of the content of the page and what the domain is.  If your domain was comcastsucks.com, it would be perfectly legal because people know that it's going to be critical of Comcast before they actually get to the site.  But with comcastroturf.com, normal people don't know what's on the site *before* they visit.  Comcastroturf could easily be a website for a Community Astroturf company (and I know that's a stretch, but think of what less tech-savvy, older people would think).  \n\nThe other half is the content, in which you are critical of Comcast by name, but only in your conclusion.  This could leave the average viewer a bit confused at to why comcast is in the domain name, since there isn't anything critical as soon as the webpage opens.\n\nSo, in their eyes, you're not being *directly* critical of Comcast in the domain or content, which they see as infringing.  In my opinion, I think this could be fair use, but it'd be a close call, and that would depend heavily on the judge that you got.  The big issue is the disconnect between the domain name and the content.  You could change the content, but at this point, I can guarantee you that they already spidered your site and have screen shots of what your page looks like when it loads.\n\nEdit: As a follow up, lawyer up and have them send a letter claiming free speech, fair use, nonconfusing, etc.  They'll know what to do and how to do it.

I'm a former analyst for LookingGlass, I can shed some light on this! And you'll probably want to read this; it's even worse for Comcast and LG than you think.\n\nComcast contracts with LookingGlass to detect and remove threats to its brand and trademark online. Normally this is done for the right reasons, either sending takedown requests to obvious cyber-squatting domains similar to the actual trademark in an attempt to trick people, or phishing scams. But, this was clearly not the case here!\n\nHere's what happened: LG's automated crawler looks for recently-registered domain names with client trademarks in them. This crawler then sends an email to the client informing them of the domains and asking if they would like us to take action on them. Here's the key part: LG didn't just automatically submit a takedown request for this domain. Comcast was notified of this domain name, and asked that LG take it down. Uh-oh.\n\nMost likely, takedown was approved for this domain before any content was actually uploaded to the site. But that doesn't really make a difference; this is still fair use. But it does explain that this is likely due to incompetence and ignorance of the law rather than outright malevolence. We were frequently asked to do takedown on charity sites that mentioned they had been sponsored by our clients (which they had been) just because they used Comcast's logo on the charity site. A logo placement that Comcast **paid to have on the charity's site**. Sometimes we were asked to do takedown on third-party affiliates that were corporate partners with our clients, effectively they asked us to shoot down their own site! The incompetence on parade here never failed to astound me.\n\nHowever! Comcast frequently used LG as its personal corporate bullying service, so it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest if this was done with malicious intent instead of plain old dumbfuckery. I was asked to do takedown on Youtube videos because they ranked higher than Comcast's own videos in the search results, for example. So I wouldn't rule out mustache-twirling villainy. \n\nBut the best part? In the rare instances in which an analyst would dispute a takedown request by informing the management that the content in question fell under the umbrella of fair use, they would be told to proceed anyway. It didn't matter in the slightest how shitty Comcast's case for takedown was, the client's wishes always took precedent. I personally advocated tenaciously against several takedowns of content similar to this domain, using the logic that attempting to take down the domain name would lead to a massive blowback against Comcast and LG if the person who received the notice posted it online. I linked the wikipedia page for the Streisand Effect to management, even. Didn't matter in the end most of the time, but we got lucky and never had any serious fallout. Until now! \n\nThese notices don't do anything anyway, something I tried and failed to explain. They aren't legally binding, they aren't real cease and desist orders, they're basically nothing but a threat. But they don't even result in domains getting taken down because there's already a process for disputing a trademark in a domain name, it's called a UDRP dispute. This isn't a UDRP, and registrars and site owners know that, and they all tell LG (and rightly so) \"UDRP or GTFO\". But that requires a legal team to draft, and that's expensive, so let's just lie to our clients and pretend that these \"takedowns\" actually do something. \"Best-effort\", right? \n\nAnd the REALLY tragic thing? The analyst who submitted this is almost certainly getting thrown to the wolves, just for following orders. I watched it happen several times, an analyst would be crucified for doing exactly what management told them to do! Most of the analysts there wouldn't even be able to define fair use, much less catch something like this. You can't expect a SOC workforce that is almost exclusively part-timers making $18/hr (in the DC area, lel) to know these kinds of things, you have to have faith that the client knows the law and knows how things are likely to shake out. I hope it's clear now more than ever that any faith in Comcast to even approach doing the right thing is completely misplaced, which comes as a surprise to fucking nobody except for the management at LookingGlass.\n\nTo add insult to injury, LookingGlass is largely concerned with anti-phishing efforts, which is actually useful work that protects people from being defrauded and having their bank accounts emptied. That's one of the rare instances in which doing something to protect people and a company's brand are the same thing. But just to give you a dipstick as to the level of competence LookingGlass can bring to the table, LookingGlass, an anti-phishing company, was itself phished earlier this year. Someone sent a phishing email to LG asking for W-2s of every current and past employee, which were helpfully zipped up and sent off to the attacker. This resulted in several of my co-workers having their tax returns claimed by someone else before they filed, effectively stealing their tax return via identity theft as a result of this phishing scam. *LG only bothered to inform the employees that this was happening about two months after they were phished.* I received a letter in the mail after I had quit that informed me of what'd happened, and took the opportunity to up-sell me on purchasing coverage from Identity Guard Gold^tm as a helpful and easy payroll deduction! What a bargain! Thanks for giving away all of the information that someone would need to steal my identity LG, I'm really stoked to be looking over my shoulder for the rest of my fucking life!

Anyone who wants to: please feel free to take it and modify it as you see fit for your own comments!\n\n>Dear FCC,\n  I work with software for a living.  Most importantly, I build systems which rely on the internet to transfer records between systems for large domestic and international companies.  I have been using the internet since the World Wide Web was starting to become popular, back in 1993.  I was building websites before search engines, and before web advertisements, before the modern internet full of video and social media and free massive online classes from Ivy League schools was a concept.\n\n>But even then, the web functioned on the basic principal of network neutrality.  As Tim Berners Lee, the creator of the World Wide Web put it:  \n\"It is of the utmost importance that, if I connect to the Internet, and you connect to the Internet, that we can then run any Internet application we want, without discrimination as to who we are or what we are doing. We pay for connection to the Net as though it were a cloud which magically delivers our packets. We may pay for a higher or a lower quality of service. We may pay for a service which has the characteristics of being good for video, or quality audio. But we each pay to connect to the Net, but no one can pay for exclusive access to me. \"\nhttp://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/132\n\n>Despite what some lobbying efforts would have you believe, the loss of Neutrality rules isn't just a threat to the current business models of certain companies like Google, it is a threat to be basic design of the web; a design which has proven itself to be a powerful democratizing force in both the social and business realms.\n\n>We require common carrier status when a company carries something on behalf of someone else.  UPS and FedEx are common carriers of packages they do not own from one party to another.  They are not allowed to open the packages, destroy them, or to route them poorly if they dislike the sender or the recipient.  Similarly, telephone companies have been classified as common carriers, carrying telecommunications across telecommunications infrastructure on the behalf of numerous customers.  ISPs are carrying data they generally do not own from one person over telecommunications infrastructure from one person to another, yet we are considering not regulating them as common carriers?\n\n>The modern world has quickly become fully dependent on the internet.  In addition to social media and its impact, much of our economy is now online, many job applications are available only online, as are many government services.  Interruption of that economy in favor of certain \"managed\" services provided by only a single company (a user's ISP in a world with very limited competition) would be extremely risky, erecting potential barriers to entry for new companies, and impacting the free-flow of information and speech (see Telus' blocking of a union website during a labor dispute, and Comcast recently filed C&D against Comcastroturf.com, a site dedicated to discussing the bot-spamming of these very FCC public feedback notes).\n\n>The details of Net Neutrality enforcement can be complex and should be discussed in detail over the coming years.  For examples, in reference to the pro-neutrality argument in favor of pure dumb pipes, should emergency signals receive priority when compared to video streaming from Netflix or Amazon?  That seems reasonable to me.  Should Comcast be allowed to once again throttle the download speed of competing voice calling or video streaming services in order to pressure customers into buying the Comcast-provided \"managed services\"?  That stinks of anti-competitive, anti-consumer behavior which should not be allowed.  But these cases should be discussed individually, not used as excuses for throwing out the very things which has given the Net its power.\n\n>What we should not do is hand last-mile monopoly power over to broadband ISPs, where the lack of competition will easily make the \"exclusive access to me\" a bargaining chip for the ISP to charge the websites I access twice; shrinking the number of available websites I have access to, preventing new startups from flourishing, and generally destroying what has made the internet, and specifically the web, what is it - an open place for anyone to start a blog or a business, and for anyone else to reach that legal content without interference from a third party who is acting as a common carrier, no matter what the FCC decides to call them.\n\n>Finally, Chairman Pai's calls for going back to the regulation of the 90's under President Clinton as a justification for removing Title II classification is exactly backwards.  Until the 2001 FCC ruling reclassifying broadband and the subsequent Brand X Supreme court case backing the FCC's authority to make such a determination, ISPs were all under title II as part of phone companies.  The internet and the web came to be and exploded through dial-up, under more restrictive rule than the current Net Neutrality rules impose.  If Chairman Pai wants to return to Clinton-era ISP regulation, then full Title II limitation would need to be imposed, including line sharing.  I don't support that, and I don't think Commissioner Pai does either.\n"}, {"comment_id": "dhxyzct", "post_id": "6cvg82", "comment": "While I don't agree with comecast I don't think there is much this site can do:\n\nUsing the ICANN Procedure\n\nIn 1999, ICANN adopted and began implementing the Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDNDRP), a policy for resolution of domain name disputes.

In Europe, providers started to bundle subscriptions with third party services. To the customer this could mean: Get a T-Mobile subscription, get Spotify for free! The danger of the mayor public supporting this is very high!\nIt sounds great but;\n1) The ISP's are taking money from both sides, clients and services!\n2) If you get free mobile streaming from a certain service it means the connection is unencrypted or the ISP is effectively using a man-in-the-middle attack to track what you're doing. That is also making your data vulnerable.\n3) They don't have to block certain parts of the internet because who is going to look for an alternative if Spotify is included with your subscription? That's unfair competition and even destroying any opportunity for low-budget start-ups to have any chance at gaining popularity.\n\nNet neutrality stops these practices so the Spotify/Netflix of the future has a fair opportunity to bloom. You are able to have a secure, private connection to the internet without anyone with money on his mind snooping around.

If we start referring to those who do not support net neutrality as people that are anti-Netflix, or anti-YouTube, and can make one of those the coloquial term, the general populace may start to care. \n\nIt needs to be taken a step further though, the American people need to realize that taking away net neutrality is in fact a method of limiting free speech. It could be called \"anti-Netflix\" legislation or \"pay-per-speak\" legislation. \n\nPeople need to be aware that this is not a matter of politics. Whether they identify as a democrat, republican, or any number of the minority parties, this is something that can be used to limit free speech.\n\nSteps to help:\n\n1. Learn the analogy of roads to explain net neutrality\n\n2. Explain the corporate motivation for ending net neutrality\n\n3. Refer to it as \"anti-Netflix\" or \"pay-per-speak\" legislation\n\n4.

They were all opposed to Title II reclassification, but that does not mean they are all uniformly in favor of Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon ripping everyone off. However, they can't get over their ideological desire to reverse anything that has to do with President Obama.\n\nThat being said, all of this is going to come down to what I call \"brute force politics.\" Meaning, everything that was listed above (call your two Senators and Member of the House, donate, write your comment to the FCC) are ESSENTIAL first steps. \n\nThe next big step is to go even further and ask for a meeting at the local district office to explain why NN is important you. You should also get your friends who agree with you to come as well. You should also try to make it to one of their town halls (provided they are still holding them, some have cancelled because they are tired of being yelled at). Bodies and numbers and a real persistent and unbearable show of force on the ground as voters back home is how we are going to win this (brute force politics). \n\nNo one is immune to the political process, and if a sufficient number of Republicans feel the pressure back home, they will have to seek their escape hatch which will likely come in the form of asking the FCC not to proceed. If just ONE Republican Senator sent a letter to the FCC telling Chairman Pai, don't move forward, for whatever reason (think of a new plan, let us legislate instead, or I'm ok with Title II in the mean time etc), that will start the dominoes. \n\nThe Democrats are pretty much all in the right place on this after the broadband privacy repeal. They know the Republicans screwed themselves by doing the cable and telephone industry a blatant favor like that and have no incentive to let them off the hook. They'll run on Internet freedom coupled with being pro-privacy right over them in 2018. It is on the Republican majority to decide how they want to get out of the head lights on this one (but it is on all of us to make sure they understand that we are the headlights).\n\nThe MAIN challenge I am seeing is the purposeful attempt by Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon as well as Chairman Pai to make their plans out to be something completely different. For example, his proposal is called \"Restoring Internet Freedom\" when in fact it is destroying it. The big cable and telephone guys are advertising like mad that they support network  neutrality despite the fact that they sued the government several times to block network neutrality. \n\nI have no doubt they will try to bamboozle right leaning voters into thinking this is about Obama and government regulation as opposed to what it is really about, enhancing the power of Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon.\n\nSo everything in the post here is super good and useful as your initial fighting tools, but the extra steps are how we convert this into a third rail issue. \n\nYou want to know why this fight keeps coming up? It is because a lot of the politicians who have been terrible on these issues keep getting re-elected because people are willing to prioritize other social division issues or taxes etc before having this as a litmus test for voting. The moment the Republicans feel like this is a loser for them (conversely the Democrats feeling like this is a winner for them), the sooner we will get to final victory.\n\nBut make no mistake, we have the biggest fight ahead of us with Chairman Pai and this proposal. Now, we got 60 to 90 days to have maximum impact, so lets make it happen (especially if you are represented by a Republican Senator or Member of the House)."}, {"comment_id": "dhr96p7", "post_id": "6bytpx", "comment": "Do you love paying more for your cable TV to get the 3 extra channels you watch that aren't in the cheaper packages? \n\nDo you love getting nickled and dimed by pointless fees on every bill? \n\nWell today we can bring this same joy to your Internet plan!

Be a person in power that decides what is enacted\n\nOr\n\n2. Influence a person in power that decides what is enacted.\n\n\nIn this case there is not time to take the first path so we must go with the second. There are many ways to do this, e.g., money, connections, etc., but for the general populace we have one primary recourse.\n\nWe must make it cost those deciding policy, to go against the people\u2019s will. If whatever form of resistance, or lack thereof, you choose does not do this or further enable this then it is basically pointless.\n\n\nIf you ask, \u201c*how* do we make it cost them something?\u201d the answer is simple.\n\n1. *Be disruptive* to the decision-makers, or anyone that can influence them, and make it known why they are being disrupted. (Direct disruption will provide direct incentive to follow the people\u2019s will, while indirect disruption will apply pressure from those that can influence them to follow the people\u2019s will so that they will stop being disrupted.)\n\n - This means direct action that will hit the pocketbook\u2019s, reputation\u2019s, convenience, and lifestyle\u2019s of these power players and those that wield influence over them.\n\n2. There is no #2, but #1 can be enhanced. Tactics of disruption should be as *long-lasting* as possible, allowing no reprieve for the powerful or for their lifestyle to return to the convenience they are accustomed to.\n\n1st Corollary: Things like one-day protests, no matter how large, have very little effect as the disruption quickly ends. Better to have a maintained smaller contingent of people providing continuous disruption.\n\n2nd Corollary: If people allow their disruption to be controlled, following the dictates of the powerful, it is no longer disruptive, and again approaches pointlessness.\n\n\nFor those unwilling to take direct action, there is still much you can do to further your cause.\n\n1. People (friends, family, coworkers, denizens of the Internet) must be educated about the issue, why it is important, and how they can help achieve the desired result.\n\n2. People can help plan to determine the most disruptive (effective) actions, their timings and locations, and reach out to actively organize others and provide them logistical support to execute those plans.\n\n\nThat\u2019s it. No matter how many books you read or how much history you analyze, you will find variations of the above. I can only hope that, now being informed, there will be those that choose to fight for their agenda instead of giving up, believing themselves powerless.\n"}, {"comment_id": "dhra2zp", "post_id": "6bytpx", "comment": "OK, I am not the type to protest about something.

In the inquiry, the Commission shall determine whether advanced telecommunications capability is being deployed to all Americans in a reasonable and timely fashion. If the Commission\u2019s determination is negative, it shall take immediate action to accelerate deployment of such capability by removing barriers to infrastructure investment and by promoting competition in the telecommunications market.\n\nThey then assert multiple times that this code \"Provides affirmative legal authority for our open internet rules\"\n\nThey cement their assertion later on in the record with \n\"Section 2 of the Communications Act grants the Commission jurisdiction over 'all interstate and foreign \r\ncommunication by wire or radio.'\u201d\n\nThat is law that was written in 1934, literally before TV, being used in an attempt to imply regulative authority over the internet.\n\nThe dissenters on the record point out that the FCC assumed the text of 47 U.S. Code \u00a7 1302 Section 706 A & B to be a delegatory(meaning it delegates actual, real power to the FCC, and thereby, actual authority over what states can and cant do) declaration, rather than being simply hortatory(which essentially means restricted to the Bully Pulpit, I.E. they can only apply verbal or written pressure on states to follow their regulations)\n\nI agree 1000% with the dissenting parties. \n\nAs they further point out, section 706 of the code used by the FCC NEVER once expressly, by any means, gives authority to the FCC. There is what sounds like a call to action, with lines like \"shall encourage\", but nowhere is the FCC actually given the explicit authority to make rules about telecommunications that supersede the rules about telecommunications within an individual state.\n\nThe array of assumptions based off of incorrect interpretations of US Codes, and clauses based off those assumptions, is the way they assume their authority over state communication commissions.\n\nThose incorrect assumptions all come to head in this: \n\"The Commission thus has evaluated possible state regulations of broadband Internet access service to guard against any conflict with federal \r\nlaw.\"\n\nAnd\n\n\"We also make clear that the states are bound by our forbearance decisions today\"\n\nAnd lastly\n\n\"Finally, we announce our firm intention to exercise our preemption authority to preclude \r\nstates from imposing obligations on broadband service that are inconsistent with the carefully tailored \r\nregulatory scheme we adopt in this Order\"\n\nThey base the largest part of their assumptions off of 47 US Code \u00a7 1302 Section 706 Subsection A. For this reason, it is in my not-quite-yet-expert-but-very-well-versed opinion that the republicans in the FCC are not capable of reading. For clearly, this:\n\n>The Commission and each\u00a0State commission with regulatory jurisdiction over telecommunications services\n\nnot only **doesn't** explicitly give authority over state telecom regulatory bodies. It, in fact, gives them the SAME authority. This excerpt, along with the remainder of Section 706 Subsection A, in absolutely no way, implies any sort of FCC authority over telecommunications.\n\nYet the commission uses it explicitly to assert the exact kind of authority it doesn't describe.

And that probably seemed nuts to you -- why wouldn't it?\n\nWell, this is why.\n\nThe FCC is an independent agency of the federal government, created via an act of Congress. These agencies are created with various justifications, but the bottom line is that Congress (who, Constitutionally speaking, holds regulatory power at the federal level of government) does not have the personnel to manage the regulation of all industries. That's a fair observation, I think, and a non-partisan one.\n\nWe here on Reddit often complain (or at least, this is my perception) that corporations buy and sell politicians like stockbrokers buy stocks. And hey, as a lifetime member of the right wing in America, I don't think you're wrong about that. I agree, and I think that it's a terrible thing.\n\nOur representatives actually represent corporations -- and yes, part of that is due to the gutting of campaign finance reform. But with enough money and determination, you can launder money through enough shell corporations and fake union organizations and PACs that, in the end, campaign finance laws really won't make that huge a difference. If you like, we can try it, but please consider a different approach as well -- and not even as a replacement for campaign finance reform, but possibly as a second prong in your counter-attack.\n\nRepeal the 1929 Permanent Apportionment Act. Massively expand Congress, so the bar for getting in is lower -- so YOU can run for Congress, without having to beg Verizon for money and airtime for campaign ads. Plus, this increases the relative power of your vote FOR a congressional representative -- which then increases the dollar amount it takes to win each individual vote.\n\nWhich makes it stupidly expensive to buy politicians. If you can't beat em, bleed them. Soak up their money with tons of members of the House. BE one of those members, and fight them from a position of some power.\n\nAnd not only this, but it will take a zombie horde of lobbyists to keep track of all of those Reps. Those are expensive, too. The more complicated we make this, the better -- complicated is expensive. And expensive is a feature, not a bug.\n\nAnd then implement campaign finance reform. A reformed, expanded House as the anvil, and campaign finance reform as the hammer -- we could structure the federal government to effectively resist corporate influence, from its very core.\n\nI'm not very hopeful that this will ever be done, to be honest. Hell, I'm not that hopeful that many people will listen, even here, in this shitstorm. But I'm gonna keep trying anyway.

I ripped out the mechanism of our old wind-up gramophone and put in a turntable and a three-valve amplifier. I made a speaker cabinet from an old book case, with a sheet of chip-board on the front. The whole system looked pretty crude, but it didn\u2019t sound too bad. At the time LPs were very expensive so I couldn\u2019t afford any of them on a schoolboy budget. But I bought Stravinsky\u2019s Symphony Of Psalms because it was on sale as a 10\u201d LP, which were being phased out. The record was rather scratched, but I fell in love with the third movement, which makes up more than half the symphony.\u201d\n\n\n[Wieniawski\u2019s Violin Concerto No. 1](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=aNOdaBJbT8A)Professor Hawking was actually inspired to buy a collection of Wieniawski\u2019s music after hearing his second concerto on Radio 3 in the 1990s, but prefers the first in particular for its \u201chaunting phrase in the first movement\u201d.\n\n\n[Francis Poulenc\u2019s Gloria](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ReqsEqKtyyA) is the final piece in Professor Hawking\u2019s musical trilogy. Part of the work caused a \u201cscandal\u201d \u2013 in the French composer\u2019s own words \u2013 when it was first performed in 1959 because of its unusual mixture of light-heartedness and spirituality. Poulenc later explained that he had been thinking of frescoes in which angels stick out their tongues and \u201cserious Benedictines whom I saw playing soccer one day\u201d when he wrote it.\nProfessor Hawking first heard the Poulenc Gloria in Aspen, Colorado, during the resort\u2019s 1995 music festival. \u201cYou can sit in your office in the physics centre there and hear the music without ever buying a ticket,\u201d he said. \u201cBut on this occasion I was actually in the tent to hear the Gloria. It is one of a small number of works I consider great music.\u201d\n"}, {"comment_id": "dvod6t9", "post_id": "84af02", "comment": "Struggled with many difficulties, lived for self-fulfillment and the advancement of mankind.

If you have phone anxiety, call tonight and leave a voicemail (make sure you leave your full name and address to prove you are a local voter).  If you're okay making phone calls, call during east coast business hours when you will likely get a real person (and may even speak to your rep directly)\n\n>Hi, my name is [NAME] and I'm a concerned customer from [TOWN]. I'm calling to express my disapproval that the FCC is trying to kill net neutrality and the strong Title II oversight of Internet Service Providers. Preserving an open internet is crucial for fair and equal access to the resources and information available on it.\n[Optional: Explain why net neutrality is personally important to you or your work]\nThank you for your time and attention.\n[IF LEAVING A VOICEMAIL: please leave your full street address to ensure your call is tallied]\n\nAnd consider adding in second issue.

So maybe your internet provider takes a payout from HBO (or they are also a cable provider), now your HBO is super fast but your Netflix is super slow.

People continue to point out the Net Neutrality aspect of this, which is very important, but they fail to understand that the major item at hand is Title II itself.\n\n>Title II enables the FCC to enact price controls in the event of gouging and the forcing of Open Access Networks (OANs) among other things. OANs are how AOL and other dial-up internet services formed in the 90s as phone lines fall under this regulation and thus AOL did not need to own its own phone lines, it was allowed to piggyback off of infrastructure already existing. The FCC could decide to at some point enact this over broadband home internet to increase competition, as various European countries have, to drop prices and increase speeds/offerings.\n\n>The item of price controls could come into play as Muricans are already charged the highest prices in the modern world for internet on a $/Mb (dollar per megabit) scale. Again, at some point (after enough complaints, maybe) the FCC could decide to start regulating what ISPs are allowed to charge us to stop the gouging. Prices are already destined and set to continually increase on home broadband due to the vast numbers of people cutting the cord. These companies all typically have cable TV offerings and even channels, and they need to make up for the lost revenue. Price gouging will only get worse.\n\n>The telecoms / ISPs despise these possibilities and they want to nip it in the butt before it can actually happen once progressives start running the gubberment / FCC. This is exactly why the corrupt Repubelican FCC (Ashit Pie) is dismantling Title II. This is why this FCC is also preempting state privacy laws, it is the ISPs getting ahead of legitimate future governments in the event they actually want to stand up for and protect the citizens of this country.\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dq5bfzo", "post_id": "7ehli9", "comment": "I'm sick of these underhand slights on the American people and our liberties.

You'll recall that as people got wise to how ISPs were trying to throttle or otherwise hamstring competitors, ISPs got more creative -- and began intentionally letting interconnection points with transit operators and companies like Netflix get congested. Why? ISPs like Comcast and Verizon hoped to 1) kill the common practice of settlement-free peering, and 2) force companies like Netflix to pay an additional toll if they wanted video packets to reach subscribers on time, and intact (aka \"double dipping\" or more bluntly, extortion).\n\n> Unnoticed by many in the lawsuit by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against Charter over slow speeds was the fact that Charter executives were busted candidly discussing this strategy to drive up costs for competitors and transit operators.

Network Management Practices. In the Open Internet Order, the Commission required ISPs to disclose their congestion management, application-specific behavior, device attachment rules, and security practices.  We adopt those same requirements and further require ISPs to disclose any blocking, throttling, affiliated prioritization, or paid prioritization in which they engage. Although requiring disclosure of network management practices imposes some burden on ISPs, we find the benefits of enabling the public and the Commission to identify any problematic conduct and suggest fixes substantially outweigh those costs. The record generally supports disclosure of ISP network practices.\n\n(Whereas before they previously unable to do most of these things. Now they just have to disclose them. FUCK.)\n\n216. We specifically require all ISPs to disclose:\n\u2022 Blocking. Any practice (other than reasonable network management elsewhere disclosed) that blocks or otherwise prevents end user access to lawful content, applications, service, or non-harmful devices, including a description of what is blocked.\n\n\u2022 Throttling. Any practice (other than reasonable network management elsewhere disclosed) that degrades or impairs access to lawful Internet traffic on the basis of content, application, service, user, or use of a non-harmful device, including a description of what is throttled.\n\n\u2022 Affiliated Prioritization. Any practice that directly or indirectly favors some traffic over other traffic, including through use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, or resource reservation, to benefit an affiliate, including identification of the affiliate.\n \n\u2022 Paid Prioritization. Any practice that directly or indirectly favors some traffic over other traffic, including through use of techniques such as traffic shaping, prioritization, or resource reservation, in exchange for consideration, monetary or otherwise.\n\n\u2022 Congestion Management. Descriptions of congestion management practices, if any. These descriptions should include the types of traffic subject to the practices; the purposes served by the practices; the practices\u2019 effects on end users\u2019 experience; criteria used in practices, such as indicators of congestion that trigger a practice, including any usage limits triggering the practice, and the typical frequency of congestion; usage limits and the consequences of exceeding them; and references to engineering standards, where appropriate.\n\n\u2022 Application-Specific Behavior. Whether and why the ISP blocks or rate-controlsspecific protocols or protocol ports, modifies protocol fields in ways not prescribed by the protocol standard, or otherwise inhibits or favors certain applications or classes of applications.\n\n\u2022 Device Attachment Rules. Any restrictions on the types of devices and any approval procedures for devices to connect to the network.\n\n\u2022 Security. Any practices used to ensure end-user security or security of the network, including types of triggering conditions that cause a mechanism to be invoked (but excluding information that could reasonably be used to circumvent network security)."}, {"comment_id": "dq9hsjn", "post_id": "7f2r7k", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "dq9h2rr", "post_id": "7f2r7k", "comment": "Disgusting.

Please wait while I access your account.\n\n\u2026\nRep: Ma\u2019am, it looks like you only have the basic Internet Services package.\n\nMe: Yeah, same one as last year.\n\nRep: Ma\u2019am, in 2018, we are pleased to tell you we have actually improved our packages to better fit our customer\u2019s needs. Your Basic Services Package covers your local news station and Comcast-approved affiliated websites only. If you wish to access more websites, you will need to upgrade your package to the Social Media, Streaming, or News Packages. If you want all three categories, you will need to upgrade to a VIP package. If you want access to more than 5 categories you will need to upgrade to the All Access Package.\n\nMe: Uh, what?? Why? What do those cost? I want the service I had last year, I didn\u2019t agree to any changes!\n\nRep: I understand ma\u2019am. Your current Basic Services Package is the same price as last year at $79.99/month, each additional package is $9.99/month for unlimited access to the approved category. VIP Packages are an additional $49.99/month and each All Access Package is an additional $129.99/month.\n\nMe: Are you @$*#&$ kidding me? If I want the same service as last year, I have to pay $210/month?!\nRep: Yes, ma\u2019am. And its unlimited access, so it really pays for itself the more time you spend on it.\n\nMe: Uh, no\u2026Why is there a change? I refuse to pay more for the same service. Isn\u2019t it illegal to filter access to websites?\n\nRep: Ma\u2019am, I\u2019m pleased to tell you that in December 2017, Ajit Pai and the FCC decided to revoke Net Neutrality rules, allowing us at Comcast to better serve you with these customized packages. If you didn\u2019t want this, you should have called your local government representative @ https://www.house.gov/representatives/find/ or submitted complaints to the FCC @ https://www.fcc.gov/about/contact.

That's what changed. And if you think for a nanosecond that corporations won't take advantage of that to increase their profits, you are potently ignorant. The obvious retort being\n\n*\"Well, they haven't, so why not?\"*\n\nProbably because the regulations are in a state of fluctuation. ISPs know NN has public support, and if Dems assume control it will be reinstated. It's not profitable for them to restructure their system, both technically and financially, if NN will be reinstated soon. They're waiting to see what happens. And if they do feel safe that NN will remain repealed indefinitely, it still won't happen fast, because they'll want to avoid consumer backlash, even though many ISPs have a monopoly in the region they serve.\n\nAnd for anyone still confused as to whether NN is good or bad, simply Google \"Pros And Cons Of Net Neutrality\".

Quite frankly, Ajit Pai understands these aspects very well.\n\nNow people may have a problem with a municipal ISP like Comcast and think there is a monopoly. But a company like Comcast needs to partner with dozens of ISPs in order for them to offer a service better than the alternatives. They usually do this by connecting to an IXP. The IXP is incentivized to prevent ISPs connecting to it from blocking/throttling traffic. The ISPs are incentivized to connect to an IXP because it significantly reduces latency.\n\nWhat was brought up then was that Comcast was throttling Netflix in order to get them to pay them money for access. However, after the fact it was discovered as a network error by Cogent that Netflix connects to.\n\nIt also would not be in an ISPs best interest to filter traffic. They can somewhat throttle connections based on tiers, but there is a limit without more sophisticated technology. What makes the internet work is simple code working fast and efficiently. The headend processes a packet in a couple lines of code.

There are technological reasons why grid-tied solar arrays don't work while the grid is down.\n\n1) Grid-tied panels are connected to grid-tie inverters (as opposed to stand-alone inverters) which function by syncronizing their AC power output to a master AC signal, aka the grid.  If the grid is down, the grid-tied inverters don't have a signal to sync with, thus they shut down.\n\n2) An active inverter supplying power in a home can absolutely kill an unsuspecting lineman if the home circuits are not first physically disconnected from the grid.  Would you put your life in the hands of unqualified non-experts medling with electricity they clearly don't understand?\n\nThere are work-arounds, but they require additional equipment and batteries.  As with a gasoline generator, a \"critical loads\" sub-panel is necessary, separated from the main panel by a transfer switch.  The transfer switch allows a portion of your home to be disconnected from the grid to establish a temporary \"micro-grid\".  Your solar inverters are within this micro-grid.  Your micro-grid must then be driven by a battery powered inverter to supply the master AC signal from which the solar inverters derive their syncronization.  This is known as AC-coupling, a technique that is growing in popularity as people discover that inexpensive grid-tied systems are totally grid-dependant.\n\nOff-grid setups are simply more expensive and complicated, while nearly all solar setups in homes today are designed specifically for on-grid use only, for price reasons.\n\nLong story short - you need batteries, an off-grid inverter and a transfer switch to use panels without the grid.

A grid-tied PV System cannot provide power without the grid. Grid-tied inverters only know one thing, to push out as much power as possible. The amount of power it is pushing is dependent on the sun light. Electrical systems need different amounts of current at different times of the day and a grid-tied PV System cannot supply differing amounts of current on demand. If the inverter is pushing too much current then it will have no where for the excess power to go causing a fault. If the inverter cannot supply enough current to the electrical system then it will also fault. Not to mention the inverter is synchronous and is not capable of creating its own sine wave. Linemen could be in danger if they were.\n\nEnergy storage is required to provide different amounts of current per the demand of the electrical system. A bidirectional asynchronous inverter is required to utilize solar and energy storage to provide power to electrical systems. This cannot be done with a simple grid-tied system.

Most people generate power directly to the grid - which FPL then pays them for - and then the customer uses electricity from the grid.\n\nSo right now if they generate electricity it'll be too downed power lines. One solar panel isnt going to pick up a neighborhood. There's no batteries to keep it going through the night.\n\nReally there's no good reason to use this most.common system in a power outage other than to charge FPL for generation that is useless to everyone.\n\nNow if you have an off grid system with your own batteries, capable of powering your own house... This doesn't apply to you. Use away. How can they stop you?

The statement made by the OP is mostly horseshit, and so is the article.\n\n> \"Renewable generator systems connected to the grid **without batteries** are not a standby power source during an FPL outage,\" the company's solar-connection rules state. \"The system must shut down when FPL's grid shuts down in order to prevent dangerous back feed on FPL's grid. This is required to protect FPL employees who may be working on the grid.\"\n\nNote the \"without batteries\" part - I'll get to that later.\n\nThis is actually *exactly how grid-tie solar systems are supposed to work* and as the regulations state, it's important that they do this so as not to endanger linemen who may be working on the grid.\n\nWhen you hook up solar panels in a grid-tie system, you're not really powering your home, what you're doing is pumping power into the electrical grid.  Your home is running from the grid like it did before, but you're also producing some power and putting that power back into the grid.  The power company bills you for what you use and credits you for what you produce in a process called net metering.  You use 30kWh, you produce 20kWh, you get a bill for 10kWh.\n\nYour grid-tie solar system *must* shutdown during a power outage, because it's basically like a mini power plant energizing the entire electrical grid.  If it doesn't, then your solar panels are would be energizing downed power lines which is extremely hazardous to emergency workers trying to fix things, who've been told by their operators that power is shutdown and it's safe to operate on the lines.\n\nNow about the battery back-up - if you have a battery-backed solar system, you *can* safely power your home by disconnecting from the grid and running on your batteries (until they run out, of course).

So if a line goes down between the main distribution system and your house, one breaker trips the line off to prevent electrified downed lines and electric fires. \n\nIf your solar panels are on the grid, even if the main feed breaker to your neighborhood trips, your panels will keep backfeeding electricity. If your lines are down somewhere or a transformer is faulted, your solar panels can drive the fault and cause significant damage. \n\nOne easy way to protect against this is to require the panels to have a synchronization signal from the grid. If it sees the grid go down, the panels trip off as well. This is an electrical safety issue. \n\nIt's not the only solution. There are products that detect something down on the grid and transfer to house power only. But you also need batteries and a higher cost system. Lower cost systems may not be capable of maintaining proper frequency without the grid there. And with no batteries you can damage stuff in your house if the power/load mismatch is too great. \n\nThis isn't as simple as greedy corporation. I'm not ruling out that fpl may be greedy and dumb.

This includes lobbying and collusion to turn licensing to prevent low quality work, into bloated bureaucracy that can't function. (edit: also lobbying to cut funding to these sectors, it's hard to be efficient if you've got nothing to work with)\n\n2nd stage is creating a monopoly. This is like using lobbying and collusion to twist the formerly mentioned licensing to reduce competition. Buying \"inefficient or obsolete\" public infrastructure for cents on the dollar. Buying up competitors that can't survive in such strict regulation but keeping the competitors brand intact is also a part of this, to give the illusion of competition.\n\n3rd stage is deregulation. Once these companies reach a certain stage of power, they no longer need governmental help to maintain their monopolies. And can do it through sheer force of the resources they accumulate. However regulation is also what keeps them in check, forces them to play by rules and ensures they keep any promises they make. \n\nBut because of stage 2, people are upset about the regulations that allowed these monopolies to form and think that their removal will somehow stop those monopolies from maintaining their stranglehold. This is reinforced by the illusion of competition; people think that free market competition will force these companies to remain competitive, despite these corporations either actually owning their competitors, or having worked out a manner to split market share in such a way as to not directly compete, working out standardized pricing by agreement rather than what the public can or will pay. \n\nAfter stage three things become a corporate oligarchy. Where corporate interests direct the world via financial ties, rather than any democratic or political sovereignty. What do you think the TAA and TPA were? \n\nSo net neutrality is trying to offset stage three. Ensure that at the end of the day, corporations must bend to the will of the people. \n\n(edit: though at the end of the day, these corporations are only helping out with net neutrality because regulation helps them maintain their market share. if they weren't actually going to lose money on this they wouldn't do shit.)"}, {"comment_id": "efjsh9t", "post_id": "am1vm7", "comment": "Yesterday I noticed the first real change to my life from the lack of net neutrality.

ISPs are fighting the method used to enforce net neutrality, and the precedence it sets, but have effectively neutered the net neutrality rules, themselves.  Comcast had been bound to net neutrality, from the time of their merger with NBC, [until last January](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/01/a-comcast-net-neutrality-commitment-from-the-nbc-merger-just-expired/).  In that time they still managed to [effectively throttle Netflix](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2608116/net-neutrality/level-3-accuses-comcast--other-isps-of--deliberately-harming--broadband-service.html), which only stopped when [Netflix started paying them for a faster connection](https://qz.com/256586/the-inside-story-of-how-netflix-came-to-pay-comcast-for-internet-traffic/).  Even with Netflix paying for a bigger pipe, [Comcast has rolled out data caps to all customers](https://www.phillymag.com/business/2015/09/11/comcast-internet-usage/) that add extra charges to any account watching more than ~143 hours of UltraHD video.  That is less than one hour per person per day, for an average sized household, unless they are streaming from a Comcast service, [which gets zero rated](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/11/comcast-launches-online-tv-service-that-doesnt-count-against-data-caps/).\n\nAgain, Comcast did all that *while complying with net neutrality enforcement*.  Don't think that any legislators are trying to reign in ISPs with net neutrality regulation.  The rules are very easy to work around, and likely written with that intent.  As long as ISPs like Comcast are striking deals with local municipalities to forbid competing services, we'll have to put up with their nonsense.\n\nIf legislators really wanted to do anything to keep the internet open, they'll need to give us the choice to use an ISP that honors net neutrality.\n\nCurrently, our best bet is competition from Wireless Internet Service Provides (or WISPs) as well as traditional data service through the cellular network.\n\n[Here's an AMA from someone that started a WISP.](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/7etu6x/iama_guy_who_setup_a_lowlatency_rural_wireless/)\n\n[Here's a link to find a WISP near you.](http://www.wirelessmapping.com/National-Coverage-Map-for-Fixed-Wireless-ISP's.php)"}, {"comment_id": "efj7hdx", "post_id": "am1vm7", "comment": "ITT: triggered right wings bitching about \"double standards\" because Reddit \"censors\" their own site from extremist or illegal content."}, {"comment_id": "efj8toi", "post_id": "am1vm7", "comment": "If the majority of what the judge is saying basically tells me they have no idea what any of this means, the wrong person is sitting on this case.

Most of that streaming is Netflix and YouTube.  \nMuch of Netflix and Youtube playback **never crosses the Internet** because your local ISP sets up *peering* systems that cache the popular videos so playback occurs over the more local network. If all streaming video playback hit the Internet backbone **the Internet would stop working**.  \n  \n##Peering with Net Neutrality  \nWith Net Neutrality the content curators (Netflix & Youtube) have the ISP's over barrel. They can tell the ISP they are responsible for bearing the cost of peering or GFY. The streaming load will effectively cause a DOS attack on their network if they do nothing and throttling the video content so there's reserved bandwidth for all other uses, such as VoIP or gaming, is now illegal.  \n  \n##Peering without Net Neutrality  \nThe local ISP's are allowed to set limits to amount of bandwidth video streaming is allowed to use. If Netflix or Youtube want to be able to promise 4k streaming then they need to negotiate with last-mile ISP's to create and maintain the peering equipment. The ISP will provide man-power for administration but the content-curators will need to pay for and maintain the equipment.  \n  \n##Who's Paying For All This?  \nWith Net Neutrality **the ISP customers pay for it - You Are**. The ISP passes the cost along to us in their billing with impunity because of *municipal franchise monopoly licensing*.  \nWithout Net Neutrality **Netflix and Youtube have to pay for it out of their profits**.  \n  \n##Municipal Franchise Monopoly Licensing\nIf you only have one wired Internet provider in your area there are two possible reasons. First possibility is you live in the sticks and the profitability for running the fiber is low so it doesn't attract competitors. The existing ISP probably had to be lured in or cajoled into providing service through deals. The second possibility is your city granted them a monopoly franchise. They do this because the cable company then issues kick-backs to the city. The city has effectively raised taxes on you by doing this. \n  \nThe real thing we need to be fighting is *municipal franchise monopoly licensing*.  \nThis requires you to go to your city council meeting and raise hell.  \nCable prices in cities without franchise monopolies are **half** of what is charged in neighboring cities with franchises.  \n  \n##Solution Without a Problem  \nThe Internet existed for **50 years** without Net Neutrality and it was never a problem.  \nBandwidth demands vs. availability on the last-mile was much tighter in the 80's and 90's than it is today. A lot of people have 400+ Mbps speeds available to them but opt for a slower plan because they just don't need that much bandwidth. ~150Mbps gets the job done.

With the failure of the harpoons, Philae bounced upwards and started spinning  a bit. It was an extremely soft landing, the bounce wasn't high, and the spinning has stopped again which could be interpreted as a second succesful landing thanks to the comet's gravity.

Here's what we have to do next:\n\nI did some back-of-the-envelope calculations for what it would take to terraform Mars, using mostly technology that we already have, but scaled up.\n\n* The atmosphere of Mars is 25 teratonnes.\n* The atmosphere of Earth is 5000 teratonnes.\n* A teratonne is 10^15 kilograms.\n* The atmosphere of Titan is 1.19 times the mass, and 1.45 times the pressure of Earth's atmosphere.  So total atmospheric mass roughly correlates to surface atmospheric pressure at a 1:1 ratio.  (This is surprising, but convenient.)\n* Kuiper belt objects' composition varies widely, but most are comprised of a combination of methane, frozen ammonia, frozen nitrogen, frozen water, frozen CO2, and silicates.\n* Assuming 1/3 H2O, 1/3 other volatiles (methane, CO2, nitrogen, ammonia), and 1/3 silicates.\n* Mass of the object would need to be **roughly** 15000 teratonnes, or 1.5x10^19 kilograms.\n* There could be many objects induced into collision paths instead of just one single object.  \n* Halley's Comet is 2.2x10^14 kg.\n* The object would need to be about 60,000 times the mass of Halley's Comet.\n* Pluto's moon Charon, by contrast, is 1.5x10^21 kg, or about 100 times too large.  (Pluto is 10X the mass of Charon)\n* The object would need to be approximately 0.1% the mass of Pluto.  (That is, 1/1000 the mass of Pluto.  Many such objects exist in the [Kuiper Belt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuiper_Belt) and [scattered disc](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scattered_disc))\n* Pluto has a mass that's 2% that of Mars.\n* Mars would be about 50,000 times the mass of this theoretical object, so a collision would have a negligible effect on its orbit.\n* The [largest nuclear explosion ever created](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba) produced over 200 petajoules of energy.\n* It's a safe assumption that nuclear warheads could be created that are 10X that, or 2 exajoules.  (The Tsar Bomba was far too large to be practical, but it could have been built larger)  That is, 2x10^18 joules.\n* 2 exajoules of thermonuclear energy applied to a comet made of ice and volatiles, would impart the majority of its energy to the comet in the form of kinetic energy, by vaporizing the volatiles and ejecting them at a high velocity.\n* Assume 50% of the energy imparted to the comet is kinetic, so 1x10^18 joules.\n* One thermonuclear bomb 10X the size of the Tzar Bomba, buried in its surface, would impart 1 joule to our theoretical Kuiper Belt object (KBO) for every 15 kilograms of its mass.\n* Kinetic energy = 0.5mv^2\n* So each warhead would impart about 0.15 m/s to our theoretical KBO. (Not very much, but enough to use to tweak its trajectory, like the hydrazine rockets on space probes, assuming a large number of bombs planted strategically over the object's surface)\n* Assuming that the ejected mass is negligible compared to the mass of the object.  Also, assuming that the majority of the radioactive fallout is ejected.\n* There are 1,850 documented cases of [retrograde comets.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_notable_asteroids#Retrograde_and_highly_inclined) (That is, comets and asteroids going around the Sun in the opposite direction as everything else.)\n* Deflecting one of these objects would be much easier than deflecting the KBO.  It could then be induced into a collision with the KBO in order to push it into an orbit in which it eventually enters Neptune's gravitational field.\n* Neptune frequently disrupts the orbits of KBOs, sending them into the inner solar system.  By forcing an object into a near-collision with Neptune, this could be done in a controlled fashion.\n* Space is *very* empty, but there are millions of objects in our solar system that are the size of asteroids and comets.  If we could plant bombs or rockets on one of them that has a trajectory that will come very close to a planet but not hit it (this happens all the time) we can greatly increase the odds of a collision. (or *decrease* the odds, if that object is headed for Earth!)\n\nNow for some assumptions:\n\n* Assuming that the gases ejected from the Martian soil and the gases already comprising the Martian atmosphere would be about equal to the amount of volatiles lost to space. Or at least, they'd be similar orders of magnitude.  I have no idea if this is a valid assumption.  I overshot a lot of the calculations to account for the volatiles that would be ejected into space, but that's necessarily hard to calculate.  Also, the number of induced collisions would probably also have an effect on how much of the volatiles are lost into space.\n* Assuming that there would be enough water in the KBO to create a hydrological cycle.\n* Assuming that Earth would be able to react in time to any large objects ejected from Mars.  That is, some sort of asteroid defense system.\n* Assuming that Mars would cool after the collision, within 1-10 years, to an environment that could support single-celled anaerobic photosynthetic life.\n* Sunlight on Mars is roughly 40% of the intensity of sunlight on Earth, similar to an overcast day.  Assuming that's enough to support photosynthesis, and that the dust cloud from the collision dissipates within a relatively short time period (ie, within a decade).\n* Assuming that atmospheric losses occur on the scale of millions of years, and that the atmosphere would stay in place for some time.  See Titan for an example of a body with a small mass and dense atmosphere.\n* Assuming that the deeper atmosphere will help protect the surface of Mars from extraplanetary radiation, which would be necessary because of Mars's weak magnetic field.\n\nPast that, I'm not really sure.  I guess manufacture enough [carbon tetrafluoride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_tetrafluoride) or [sulfur hexfluoride](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur_hexafluoride) to create a very strong greenhouse effect.  These gases are nontoxic, and would have negligible effects on organisms.  This would have to be done before Mars became too cold to support life.\n\nedit: I posted this last year, and am kind of excited that humanity is now one step closer to accomplishing my pipe dream. :)"}, {"comment_id": "cm0i3e4", "post_id": "2m2yl7", "comment": "Its now offical - Vladimir Putin claims half of the comet is ethnically Russian and he is concerned about Europeanisation of the comet."}, {"comment_id": "cm0imcq", "post_id": "2m2yl7", "comment": "Size of the comet with Manhattan for scale:\n\nhttp://graphics8.nytimes.com/newsgraphics/2014/11/08/rosetta-philae/assets/NYT_comet_manhattan_comparison.jpg"}, {"comment_id": "cm0qsny", "post_id": "2m2yl7", "comment": "This only costed every european citizen 3.5\u20ac euros...

I find it unreasonable that a company try and \"ration\" something such as bits of data that flow freely through an infrastructure that customers already pay for through their monthly premium.  Data caps hurt the consumer's ability to choose additional services that require high bandwidth, such as media streaming, game downloading, and more. It hurts our economy as a whole as people give up services that they would otherwise pay for. Internet, unlike utilities such as water or electricity, do not have a higher cost associated with higher usage once an infrastructure is in place. We are faced with a product which breaks the traditional supply-and-demand model because supply becomes truly infinite. Comcast is akin to a company that charges you to install an air vent in your home. They have a right to charge you for the labor and materials to install the vent, but they do not have the right to charge for the amount of air that flows through the vent. Down the road, they may charge you more for a larger vent as your needs expand, but again, it would be absurd to try and then limit the amount of air you are allowed to draw from an effectively infinite source.  These practices must not be allowed to continue, as it only hurts the consumer and enriches a monopolistic entity.

You can find your representatives here:\n\nhttp://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/\n\nhttp://www.house.gov/representatives/find/\n\n>A great threat facing innovation for our country today is the monopolized market of internet service providers. The Internet has quickly gone from a luxury to a necessity for everyday life, and even more so for people like me who work from home.\n\n>Comcast's data cap policy is a flawed consumer control measure against those who would go without cable and a direct action against companies that have actually innovated over the past decade rather than sit pretty on a monopoly.\n\n>Why this is flawed:\n\n>There is no guarantee of accuracy or transparency:\nRegardless of your stance on the matter there should be no argument that internet usage amounts should be accurate and transparent to users affected by it. However that is not the case at all, there is no third party government agency in charge of regulating broadband metering. Comcast contracts out its metering to a third party vendor and its methods of measurement are internal and not open to the public at all. Just this year alone Comcast has received thirteen thousand complaints about their data caps and their terrible accuracy in measurement. Almost everyone who has to deal with this caps seems to have a story of their ISP charging them for data usage that would be impossible given their current bandwidth.\n\n>Discourages cord cutting and stifles competition:\n\n>Data caps exist solely as a consumer control measure to stifle competition and cause users to be biased against applications based on the data amount they use. For example Netflix which lists high quality HD as using 3 GB per hour and Ultra HD as using 7gb per hour is immediately affected by this. As Ultra HD becomes more common and using 7gb of data for an hour of video streaming becomes common place users affected by data caps will hit their limits more easily causing them to be charged overages. This will cause users to drop Netflix in favor of less data intensive services which Comcast will only be too happy to provide through cable. Families of five living in a home with heavy Netflix usage will already be pushing this current limit.\nThis isn't just for videos of course, people who use services for work will be hit just as hard especially as the size of applications increases, data intensive services that would have otherwise been developed will languish on the vine as data caps cause consumers to be biased against them.\n\n>Users have little choice in what ISP they must subscribe to:\n\n>The Internet is no longer a luxury that most can live without. For many it has become an essential utility much like electricity.\n\n>In any online conversation regarding complaints against Comcast or any ISP for that matter the main complaint of users is that they have no choice in their ISP (\"Save us Google Fiber!\"). Those lucky enough to live in major metropolitan areas may be fortunate enough to have the choice of maybe two or more ISPs but for many users the local ISP is the only choice they have which grants that business a monopoly in their area. In a happier world there would be dozens of ISPs each competing with each other and vying for market share so the poor behavior of one company only provides an opportunity for another to gain more customers. Sadly most Americans don't live in that kind of free economic environment.\n\n>We need to open the free market to other ISP's and increase innovative pursuits for better internet access as the rest of the developed world is starting to leave us behind.

Our world has reached a point where even the U.N. recognizes internet access as a basic human right, and Comcast's implementation of data caps is a looming threat to this right.\n\n\nIn many locations, Comcast has already implemented a 1TB data cap on its customers. The company claims this is a reasonable limit that few users will exceed, but the data caps will inevitably be implemented to Comcast customers in all regions. And before long the 1TB limit will be reduced to 750 or even 500GB under the same pretense that \"most customers don't use that much data\". Eventually those internet data caps will be cripplingly low, and customers will be charged exorbitant amounts to upgrade their internet plans. Moreover, because many areas - such as the city where I live - only have one major internet service provider. That means customers have no reasonable alternative, and Comcast has an effective monopoly to charge whatever rates they desire. Of course this is a symptom of a larger problem, but emphasizes the point that Comcast can abuse these data caps with little regulation and doesn't have to worry about losing any customers.\n\n\nIn addition to these concerns about customer abuse, the data caps are another way for Comcast to slowly infringe upon net neutrality. What happens when users can't stream Netflix or Hulu because of their data limit, but Comcast's own X1 streaming service conveniently doesn't count towards their own data limit. Is that not the same as providing preferential speeds to certain websites and services while limiting others to the internet slow lane?\n\n\nFinally, consider this point. Does it sound reasonable for a cable company to limit how many hours of TV you can watch every month? If that sounds absurd, then the idea of internet data caps should as well. Please consider these facts carefully when considering the current state of internet service, and prevent internet data caps from becoming a harsh reality."}, {"comment_id": "d8pndio", "post_id": "5749a8", "comment": "I agree.

There is no legitimate, technical reason for these data caps. Comcast itself admitted in internal customer service guidelines that these caps aren\u2019t about network congestion. Instead, it claims these data caps are about \u201cfairness,\u201d but the broadband industry continues to see higher revenues and profits with lower costs overall and there\u2019s no argument that these caps are based on any \u201cfair\u201d costs that Internet usage causes. \n\nThe real reason behind these caps is to protect Comcast\u2019s monopoly over cable TV, making it more expensive for customers to \u201ccut the cord\u201d even if they want to choose other video options. And by exempting only its own online video application from the cap, Comcast gives Stream TV an advantage over all competing online video applications. This violates the spirit of Net Neutrality, if not its letter, but the worse offense is using their monopoly on broadband internet to do that because they have no competitors (they are the only ones offering broadband as defined by the FCC, ATT broadband service isn't available where I live, in Fort lauderdale.

I'll try to explain.\n\nThe FCC is a federal regulatory agency. They do not exist in a vacuum, they do not control policy, and they do not get to pick and choose what happens and why. They are empowered entirely and exclusively by the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (many, many times since then, obviously), and can only function within the dictates of Congress. The Commissioners (five) are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate. No more than three (3) may be of the same party as the President, and it probably goes without saying that the Chief Commissioner is almost always the same party. While the Commissioners do indeed answer to the President, they have no legal power to do anything not within the authority granted them by Congress.\n\nIn effect, the FCC at any moment -- or at least the usual majority -- is trying to advance the President's communications agenda, balanced by the rest of the Commissioners and the limitations of law that bind them. Congress, meanwhile, though generally more distant, can and does apply direct pressure to the Commission, and at all times has the power to overrule the President if they decide to do it.\n\nAn example of this power play was in the Commission's Jan. 2000 Rule and Order creating Low-Power FM. Having lost their case against LPFM before the Commission, major broadcast incumbents fell back to Congress, who by the end of that same year issued new legislation severely watering down the new service. It took another ten years to convince Congress to relax those restrictions, and until then the Commission was powerless to do anything about it, no matter who was President and no matter how many citizens begged them to change it.\n\nThe battle for Net Neutrality was a major investment of political capital both by the Commission and by President Obama, as it both alienated powerful interests and risked a showdown with their congressional allies (and could have easily gone the other way, and disastrously). In fact, that issue is still out there, in case Congress ever gets it into its head to go after it again. The Commission is wary of that fact. But the Commission and the President made a strong case on both principle and policy, as well as history, that's hard to dismantle. (And it took them a long time, as you may remember, to devise a sufficiently robust argument to hold against the inevitable and substantial resistance that came. We were lucky to a large extent, but you should also thank the Commission for taking the time and care to work out as strong as case as they could, knowing that it was likely the only good chance they'd get.)\n\nData caps don't fall under a similar set of principles, because they're generally regarded as a matter of commercial contracts between private parties rather than stemming from broad regulatory principle and history. (Net Neutrality, for example, relies heavily on the prior and usually unchallenged principle of common-carrier service that applies to telephone service. Most of the FCC's case was argued not on the strict merits that most proponents offered, but on the assertion that ISPs are common carriers, the strict doctrines for which had already been settled decades earlier.)\n\nThe case *can* be made that some advertisement or *written* promises may constitute false or misleading claims. (For example, the plain meaning of 'unlimited' can probably be pressed, even if there's a little asterisk and footnote claiming it means something different.) That's a fairly straightforward truth-in-advertising or fair and honest trade argument with many decades of settled law behind it, and few or no political complexities. In effect, you're only demanding that 'unlimited' mean that in practice, but the most likely effect is that they'll just stop using that word and instead use something else that's harder for regulators to attack. It's not likely to result in actual unlimited service unless the carrier is really willing to do that, and if they are then it's likely to cost more, and the FCC is not empowered to interfere with lawful contracts. You can make a case for accuracy, but not for specific terms as long as they're accurately conveyed.\n\nIn the same way, pressing the case for transparency is also pretty sound, though it doesn't mean you'll get unlimited data caps. It only means that you can probably get the FCC to make ISPs be transparent either about *not* giving you unlimited data caps, or charging you more for it. It's important to separate what you're actually getting for your money (which is a commercial contract issue) and how it's being communicated to you and fulfilled (which is more within the realm of regulatory authority). If Comcast says, \"Okay, no more bullshit, there will be *no* unlimited caps, but here are the tiers you can choose from and what they cost,\" then that's pretty much where the Commission's authority ends. They can make Comcast be clear and honest about it, but they can't make them give you any particular data cap at any particular price.\n\nThe other issues you raise -- consumer choice and flexibility -- are serious problems in U.S. Internet service, and are *technically* within the Commission's authority, but I'm going to explain why we should not bring this to them, and what we should do instead that's more likely to be effective and get the results we want.\n\nThese are not quite 'third rail' issues for the FCC, but they are very touchy politically and especially economically. Remember that at least until the Supreme Court changes or refines its ruling in *Citizens United* or an Amendment fixes that problem, what RomneyBot 2004 said remains at least *legally* true for now: \"Corporations are people, my friend.\" We are not the only people with a voice in this debate.\n\nComcast and other major ISPs have *full time* lobbyists who work Congress to prevent exactly this sort of thing from happening. We vastly outnumber those assholes, and have vastly more power because we can vote and corporations can't, but we're not there every day and they are. If enough of us write in with polite, thoughtful, lucid letters, we can easily block them, but the problem is that there's far too little citizen lobbying going on. On average, only about *one in* ***ten thousand*** *people* bothers to *ever* contact their elected reps. That's far too little participation to counter the full-on activity of *paid* lobbyists. However, it's much *cheaper* for us to gang up on them.\n\nAnd they know that, which is why they work so hard to get their case heard. They prepare arguments that are designed to go down well in committee hearings, in language that congresscritters understand, essentially handing them prepackaged polemicals designed to shoot down the kinds of proposals they fear.\n\nThankfully, all we need to do to counter that is talk directly to the same people, as voting constituents, in our own plain language. As long as you do this politely and clearly, you'd be surprised how much purchase you can get. They *will* listen to you. Never mind what your cynical friends say. Since you can't literally buy votes, you cannot literally buy congressmen; if enough of us speak up, and clearly enough, we *can* prevail. I know, because I've done it myself. We are *always* more powerful than those creeps. All we have to do is *use* that power, and use it intelligently.\n\nAs the FCC must answer to Congress, even over the President, taking this case to Congress directly and first prevents both a protracted and very difficult struggle at the Commission, which must always be mindful of Congress and their friends looking over their shoulders and constantly watching out for things like this, and also pre-empts any fallback efforts by those same powerful interests, by taking the fight directly to their only real source of power over the FCC and taking it away from them. If we get Congress on our side, then the FCC not only has no choice but to go along, but also enjoys the delicious opportunity (and they really do enjoy this, believe me) of telling those same interests, \"Sorry, can't help you, Congress said.\"\n\nThe mistake that far too many activists make is presuming that regulatory agencies enjoy substantial unilateral authority in policy creation and enforcement, and they mostly don't. Especially where lots of money is concerned -- and it very much is here -- you need to go where the money is going to be most likely used against you, and attack that point directly.\n\nThe FCC went to wall for us for Net Neutrality, and just barely pulled that one through. They're not ready for another major showdown, especially against the same battle-ready opponents, and they know that. They'll do everything they can to avoid it, because they know all too well the potentially damaging long-term effects of losing, which is a lot more likely for them with these issues.\n\nTo the extent that you can make plain, clearly defined, *limited* regulatory arguments based on well-established principles, by all means, bring those to the FCC to deal with. They'd probably *like* an opportunity to go after Comcast and their ilk for bad dealing.\n\nBut on the broader issues of choice and flexibility, I can't stress enough how risky it is to take that battle to The Portals instead of to Congress, where the real battle over those things is likely to be. If you start at the FCC, you'll exhaust yourself *and* the Commission beating down opponents' well-practised game of rhetorical whack-a-mole, and you'll end up at Congress anyway, where they'll have spent that time building up their support there, so that by the time you get there you'll have a much tougher time of it. If you bring these complex issues to Congress first, you deprive them of every advantage they'd have otherwise.\n"}, {"comment_id": "d8p0xx4", "post_id": "5749a8", "comment": "Everyone commenting here should go file a complaint with the FCC.

I find it unreasonable that a company try and \"ration\" something such as bits of data that flow freely through an infrastructure that customers already pay for through their monthly premium. Data caps hurt the consumer's ability to choose additional services that require high bandwidth, such as media streaming, game downloading, and more. It hurts our economy as a whole as people give up services that they would otherwise pay for. Internet, unlike utilities such as water or electricity, do not have a higher cost associated with higher usage once an infrastructure is in place. We are faced with a product which breaks the traditional supply-and-demand model because supply becomes truly infinite. Comcast is akin to a company that charges you to install an air vent in your home. They have a right to charge you for the labor and materials to install the vent, but they do not have the right to charge for the amount of air that flows through the vent. Down the road, they may charge you more for a larger vent as your needs expand, but again, it would be absurd to try and then limit the amount of air you are allowed to draw from an effectively infinite source. These practices must not be allowed to continue, as it only hurts the consumer and enriches a monopolistic entity.

Suspicious.\n\nDear FCC, \nComcast recently rolled out a 1TB cap on data usage for all of its existing plans in markets throughout the United States. This change constitutes a major alteration to the service they sold myself and other consumers, which previously did not include any such cap on data. The new imposition of this data cap signals that Comcast is 1) not interested in upgrading existing infrastructure, 2) wishes to take advantage of tiered usage through bait-and-switch, and 3) is confident enough in the lack of availability of alternatives in areas where they hold a monopoly on internet service access. \nComcast has admitted that their data caps are not to manage congestion. They are leveraging their monopoly status in order to force consumers to pay more, in addition to incentivizing customers to use their other products, which do not count against their data caps. In this way, Comcast is violating Net Neutrality, as their chosen services receive an artificial competitive advantage over other services. This stifles innovation and slows the progress of America's technology. \nI am the perfect microcosm of the situation. I am a cord-cutter; Comcast's least favorite consumer. I own my own cable modem and router, I do not subscribe to their cable tv services. I am quick to recommend any other internet company. Because of their caps, I have been forced to reduce my internet usage, reducing or eliminating my participation in novel products and services, taking away valuable revenue and attention from the forefront of innovation. I am appalled by the situation and wish I could change it. And yet, I am forced to use Comcast. I have literally no other choices and none are likely to appear anytime soon, due to Comcast's abhorrent abuse of regulatory capture in addition to the naturally high cost of entry. These conditions indicate to me that more regulation is required. Internet has become a utility as necessary to modern families as electricity and water, and it should be regulated as such. Comcast currently has no such regulations, and consumer exploitation in the form of data caps and other anti-consumer measures are the result. \nI ask that the FCC please enact and enforce new rules limiting the ability of internet service providers to impose data caps on this critical public utility. \nSincerely, \nKen\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "d8p5gsp", "post_id": "5749a8", "comment": "Okay.

A phone call is similar to a TCP connection in that you cannot truly spoof it, as the handshake process requires a valid address on both ends. What they are spoofing is the caller ID info, which also contains the number, but that data can be freely altered by the caller, as it is not used by the phone company to connect a call.\n\nIf the phone company wanted to stop those spam callers, they would block the spammer based on information that they could not spoof and still have a workable call. Furthermore, in the cases of spammers who use a mass calling service, phone companies can pressure them to removing bad actors by blocking those services entirely until they remove the bad actor (this is done on the internet when a hosting company has a bad actor uses a VPS to attempt to packet flood someone using a 10 gigabit connection.\n\nSo far for me, the scam calls have gotten so bad that I used an app called \"hiya\" to block the general spam, and for the spoofed number scams (since they use the area code of your cellphone line), I simply block everything on my area code that is not in my contact list, thus they have to text me first before they can call me. So far, this has reduced the scam calls to a point where I can go months before one makes it through.\n\nFor scammers based in the US, the government can also get rid of them, as they have the capabilities. There have been cases where the secret service was able to track down a threatening caller to the white house in under 20 minutes and have agents at their door, even though the caller used a spoofed number.\n\nSadly the issue with most scam calls is they use mass calling services in other countries, (often India) because they never really cooperate with US law enforcement for crimes of that level. This the only real remedy is to have service providers block them. The only reason why it doesn't happen, is because the phone companies do not want to spend any money on having workers do such a process that cannot be automated, as some human thought is needed on when deciding to simply not route calls from a specific location."}, {"comment_id": "e7hqmgm", "post_id": "9mtngy", "comment": "Maryland made it a crime last week to place spoofed caller ID calls for the sake of deception and advertising so there's a glimmer of hope if other states follow suit."}, {"comment_id": "e7hsvc9", "post_id": "9mtngy", "comment": "The \u201cIRS\u201d calls me every day to tell me there\u2019s a warrant for my arrest.

I specifically told Mike Lee about my feelings of betrayal that he would help to introduce such a horrible bill. I labeled it for what it was. I told him to stop fighting policies put in place during the Obama administration just to be fighting against Obama, and to actually think about what this can do to us 5-10 years down the road. I told him that I don't want the internet in control of telecoms. This was his response through one of his aids Pete Blair:\n\n&nbsp;  \n\n> Thank you for contacting Senator Lee with your thoughts on Net Neutrality and the \"Restoring Internet Freedom Act.\" Your input and engagement is highly valued by the Senator, and he has asked that I reply.\n\n> Senator Lee believes the Internet is not broken and is one of the most productive and innovative sectors of our economy. This is because the government has consistently followed a hands-off approach. However, the FCC continues to try to expand its authority so that it can regulate the Internet. This is its third attempt to pass so-called \u201cnet neutrality\u201d rules and regulations that would result in fewer Internet options, increased costs, and slower access to important services. If particular Internet service providers are engaged in anticompetitive behaviors that harm consumers and competition, our antitrust laws are there to stop that. It may be appropriate for Congress to review how those laws are being enforced in the Internet area. But it is certainly not in the best interest of consumers, for a 5-person unelected Commission to drastically alter the operation, maintenance, and accessibility of the Internet. This could in fact break the Internet. As the ranking member of the Antitrust Subcommittee, Senator Lee is dedicated to promoting a robust, competitive Internet market and will continue to monitor the actions taken by the FCC. Rest assured that he has been made aware of your thoughts, and he will keep them in mind as he continues to monitor this legislation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nI post this because I want you all to know, that:  \n\n1) Our letters are read, even if it isn't read directly by our elected officials. Be loud. Eventually they will hear us.  \n2) I want you to know what is being said by these people in return.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThis reply obviously shows that Senator Lee is either A: Highly Misinformed, and is out of touch with what is really happening, or B: a VERY CORRUPT individual who is in the pockets of telecoms, and is spouting off bullshit to make himself look like he really doesn't know that what he is doing is bad for the nation.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nNow, I know I'm getting into rant mode and am starting to sound like a conspiracy theorist. I don't want to sound like that. However, I post these strong words knowing that people pay attention, and I hope that I'm not the only one who thinks this way. Maybe if enough people voice their displeasure, our elected officials will take a step back and think long and hard about what they truly stand for and how they want to be remembered. Do they want to be the actual voice of the people, or do they want to cater to special interests and sell their souls? Having all of the money in the world means NOTHING if no one will vote for them and they can't stay in power. I know that I for one will be actively telling everyone I know not to give this guy another term. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nI usually try to stay out of politics. It causes so much drama and trouble. Sure, I stay informed, and I have my own opinions, but I try to keep them to myself. Not this time around. This is too important. We need to be the loud voice that stands up and says \"Not today!

Some of my concerns may be unfounded as I don't know all the details of the cave in question, but I've looked at the rough situation.\n\nMy first concern is that the divers who are participating don't SEEM to have specific cave diving knowledge or gear. The Thai SEAL who died a few days ago was pictured in what appeared to be recreational/open water scuba gear, not gear optimized for a cave environment. I saw no double tanks, no redundant lights, and hose routing that is dangerous in a cave environment. SEAL or not, if you bring the wrong gear for the wrong dive, you're severely elevating the risk for yourself and others.\n\nThe information about the cave seems to suggest that the underwater portions are several hundred meters (maybe close to a mile) in length, and they look like they're trying to do it in single aluminum 80s. This is damned near suicidal.\n\nGetting somebody out of this safely who is a weak swimmer and has no scuba experience would be difficult enough if the problem was just going up to air, however in a cave you have to follow the path you came in before there's atmosphere again. This necessitates specific training, technique, and gear that is different than what you'd wear on a typical dive in the ocean in order to deal with unique risks that are present in cave (or other overhead) environments.\n\nThe people I've seen so far look like they're gearing up for an ocean dive. It's concerning.\n\nIt's possible that the cave geology is vastly different than the limestone caves we're used to here, and maybe the training and technique is different, but I suspect not.\n\nI hope they get these kids out unharmed, but I also hope the rescuers aren't endangering themselves more than they otherwise would be.\n\nI'm not sure what magic submarine Elon Musk has built, and if it helps a rescue effort, great... But caves are harsh. Things get damaged, and that restriction sounds pretty tight if it's not even possible to single-file through it while air sharing normally. I don't know how lean this piece of equipment is.\n\nTl;Dr: ramblings of a cave diver on Thai cave rescue\n"}, {"comment_id": "e1z51me", "post_id": "8wwiqn", "comment": "I swear if Elon and his team manages to be the ones to save these kids I will never doubt this man ever again.

We may as well allow corporations to mandate the U.S. Department of Transportation and City and State traffic laws.  \n\nAs Abraham Lincoln once said, \"Government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the Earth.\"  \n\nOur Government must be in control of its own economy, or it is no government at all.  \n\n "}, {"comment_id": "dhb389t", "post_id": "69y4as", "comment": "I just read a new article saying we attacked the FCC website, LOL.\n\nARTICLE HERE:http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/fcc-website-hit-by-attacks-after-net-neutrality-proposal/ar-BBATz8L?li=AA4Zoy&ocid=spartandhp\n"}, {"comment_id": "dhbb04g", "post_id": "69y4as", "comment": "The irony is, I can't watch the video because \"this uploaded has not made this content available in your country\""}, {"comment_id": "dhbf1sv", "post_id": "69y4as", "comment": "Can we just ban everyone subbed to T_D already?"}, {"comment_id": "dhbggsc", "post_id": "69y4as", "comment": "well i left my comment:\n\n-----------------------------\n\ni filed a comment here last time this issue came up and i was overjoyed to see that the FCC listened to me and the millions of other people who spoke up to support net neutrality and title II, and when i read wheeler's article on title II i felt happy that this issue would be layed to rest, that the FCC would be working to bring back competition to the ISP marketplace, a return to times when the internet went over title II lines (phone lines) and the barriers to entry into the market were much lower without the need to run your own lines.\n\nso, you can imagine my discontent to be here again, to once again have to tell a NEW administration that i WANT title II regulation of internet providers, i do NOT want ISPs to be able to use their position to demand protection money from website operators to keep their content going smoothly, i don't want them to use their position to favor their service over the service of competitors or take money from one site to slow a competitor (or have the competitor slow by default and pay to have their own service be faster...it's functionally the same)\n\nyou say this is just hypothetical, who cares. it's a good strategy for making money and i think we can agree companies have a fiduciary responsibility to make as much money as they can for their investors...so if it's a working strategy they WILL do it, it then becomes incumbent on government to prevent such abuse.\n\nyou say it's just changing the legal footing to be handled by congress instead of by the FCC, fine, have congress pass a bill protecting net neutrality FIRST then you can repeal your rules when they become redundant, it's stupid to repeal these rules first and leave nothing until congress can figure out a replacement.\n\nyou say that net neutrality prevents investment in infrastructure, find me an ISP who will attest to that under oath. they won't because when they are under oath, they say the exact opposite, and some upstarts, like google fiber, say it will actually help them.\n\nyou have a responsibility to promote investment in internet technology and remove barriers to entry, Title II does that, it declares the internet a utility, just like water or electricity, which entitles upstart ISPs (like google fiber) to use pole access, this makes it easier to lay out new fiber and in turn lowers the barriers to entry promoting new ISP development, municipal development of internet does the same, the city runs the lines, owns the lines, and rents the lines out to ISPs, no need to run your own lines means a lot lower barrier to entry.\n\nplease, listen to the people. we spoke in mass last time, we said in one big voice that we support net neutrality and title II, to ignore that is to give the middle finger to the people you are supposed to serve.\n\n------------------------------\n\nthe formatting got fucked up when i submitted though (all squished onto one line)"}, {"comment_id": "dhafu0v", "post_id": "69y4as", "comment": "From his twitter (found in the article) with regards to this episode of Last Week Tonight:\n\n>Internet commenters: Visit (http://gofccyourself.com) and urge the FCC to keep strong net neutrality rules backed by Title II."}, {"comment_id": "dhagfmf", "post_id": "69y4as", "comment": "Fucking ridiculous how long we've had to fight for this.

Feel free to copy it completely and sign your own name to it when you submit. \n\nAs a citizen of the United States of America and a denizen of the internet, I am here to file this document in the interest of demanding that as the regulatory agency responsible for ensuing that communication technologies remain open and available for all Americans, as stated in the Communications Act of 1934, \"\"make available so far as possible, to all the people of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex, rapid, efficient, Nationwide, and world-wide wire and radio communication services with adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\" \n\nAs such, it is with great urgency that I, as an american citizen, demand that the FCC fulfill its purpose by ensuring and maintaining the Title II regulations that ensure an open internet, and that the policies put in place in the interest of maintaining net neutrality be kept in place for the foreseeable future. There is no perceivable benefit that would be afforded to the American people by revoking these regulations, nor is there any scenario in which the principles of net neutrality being kept in play can reasonably be expected to conflict with or impede the desire or motivation of internet service providers to pursue innovation within the development of communication technology or internet infrastructure, despite statements made by FCC Chairman Ajit Varadaraj Pai, who \"coincidentally\" is a former employee of Verizon Communications, an Internet Service Provider. \n\nThe only people who stand to gain any benefit from the revocation of the protections to net neutrality offered by Title II classification are people who have an express benefit in utilizing their control over internet traffic to slow down or speed up internet connection speeds for content they have a financial investment in (For example, Comcast owns a 30% stake in Hulu through NBC Universal. If Title II regulations are lifted and net neutrality guidelines removed, there is nothing to stop Comcast from using their service to slow down a persons web traffic when they try to use or access a service that competes with Hulu, like Netflix or Amazon Prime), actions which internet service providers would be well within their ability to commit, at a severe detriment to the american public\n\nThe internet is, at its very heart, the purest and greatest expression of freedom of speech since the introduction of the written word. It represents the ideals and constitutional rights of Freedom of Speech and Freedom of Expression that we hold so very dear (and have a constitutional right to), and net neutrality is what makes that possible. The Internet must remain a free, open and unhindered platform for that to continue, but that will only happen if internet service providers are regulated and stopped from censoring or restricting access to anything they don't like or don't own. The internet is a platform where anyone can succeed or be heard, and if the Title II regulations are repealed or rolled back, as Chairman Ajit Varadaraj Pai wants, it will no longer be that free and open platform for creativity, expression and freedom. Americans want a free, open and protected internet, and if the FCC fails to protect our internet, then it has failed at the mission it was created to fulfill. \n\nSigned, \n"}, {"comment_id": "dhaewd4", "post_id": "69y4as", "comment": "I don't know about anyone else but the gofccyourself link didn't work for me.

Fidelity, Centurylink... We even had some startups that had failed. So our city decided to come together and start a municipal broadband network.\n\nCenturylink unsurprisingly wanted nothing to do with it, but Fidelity offered to help as long as the city made a few concessions. However, right before the deal was struck Fidelity changed their minds and altered the deal a la Darth Vader. The city chose to table the discussion rather than plow forward with a bad, unfair deal (or no deal at all).\n\nThat's where we sit now, and all of a sudden this anti-municipal broadband Facebook group shows up, claiming to be a group of \"concerned taxpayers\" and all they do it shit-talk municipal broadband projects all over the country.

Jones (which they mention but kind of skim over), a case in which it was unanimously ruled that using a GPS device to track a car constitutes a search under the 4th Amendment. This means that it requires a warrant. So I think the fundamental takeaway, that tracking someone via location data requires a warrant, would be hard to change especially so soon and with 8/9 of the Justices on the court the same as during that case.\n\nWhere we could run into trouble is in the fact that while the whole Court ruled that it was a search, the reasoning was different and the \"majority\" opinion (the reasoning that 5 of the Justices in the case used even though they all agreed on the fundamental ruling) relies  on the fact that the police PHYSICALLY installed the GPS tracker. So I could see the argument being put up that since the police didn't physically put a tracker on the person, but rather used something that they have on them all the time and give outside entities permission to track them via apps and such, that they have no reasonable expectation of privacy. Of course many apps promise not to share your data, but I still could see the argument being made. But again, it would be difficult, I think,  to rule that this sort of tracking can be warrantless so soon (in court time) after ruling that very similar tracking requires a warrant.\n\ntl;dr The SCOTUS has ruled pretty recently (2012) that GPS tracking requires a warrant, and while this case deals with different circumstances and has one different Justice, I don't personally think they would say that this is so fundamentally different that it requires a different standard and essentially throw out an earlier unanimous decision."}, {"comment_id": "dj1397b", "post_id": "6ht020", "comment": "This has the potential to be the most important privacy case *if and only if* five justices agree to reexamine the Third Party Doctrine, which to date only Justice Sotomayor has hinted at (see her concurrence in United States v.

For a dragnet/find the match, I think only getting personally identifiable data would absolutely necessitate it, while looking only for a yes/no response (suspecting a serial criminal, does data exist?)\n\nThe big issue is if you target one person's locations, you're ignoring other positives.

Consumers deserve, and broadband providers support, net neutrality protections such as no blocking or throttling. **But these numbers highlight why Title II regulation is the wrong approach for the internet economy, for consumers, and for our common goal of deploying more high speed broadband to all Americans. **\n\nAn independent researcher would note that, even if all of the estimates and approximations were somehow perfectly correct (and if you read the analysis, it's immediately clear that an enormous amount of liberties were taken when adjusting and compiling these numbers) that *there is no credible way you can point to Net Neutrality is the main cause of any drop in investment*.\n\nOther factors, for example the timing of the conversion from LTE to 5G wireless networks, could have played a much more significant role. But that's not the position of US Telecom, and it's therefore not the position of the Chairman of the FCC.\n\n[Here is another position paper by the Phoenix Center](http://www.phoenix-center.org/perspectives/Perspective17-07Final.pdf), or really by Dr. George S. Ford. Again, it's a think tank position paper, not a peer-reviewed academic publication.\n\nSo Ford's entire argument hinges around a claim made by a guy named Harold Feld who blogs on [Wetmachine.com](http://www.wetmachine.com/tales-of-the-sausage-factory/ncta-agrees-title-ii-virtuous-cycle-totally-working-or-pais-economics-v-the-actual-real-world/). I'm not joking, that's the reference used in Dr. Ford's \"paper\" (check note #4). Feld made a stupid claim that because, from the numbers he saw, internet speeds have increased, that Net Neutrality is benefiting the internet. It's a claim that should not be taken seriously, as there are too many factors involved to draw a causal relationship.\n\nDr. Ford found a way to analyze the internet speed data to prove that speeds have actually *decreased*. So therefore, Ford \"proves\" that Net Neutrality is making the internet worse. He wants you to gloss over the fact that neither he and Feld can prove any realistic connection between internet speeds and Net Neutrality rules.\n\n> \"Indeed, **accepting Mr. Feld\u2019s theory about the relationship between speed  and  reclassification**, \u201cbut  for\u201d the FCC\u2019s 2015 Open Internet Order, U.S. broadband speeds would have been about  10%  higher or  about 1.5 Mbps faster on  average.\"\n\nThere should be no \"acceptance\" of Mr. Feld's theory, and therefore there shouldn't be an acceptance of a paper that tweaks the number and draws the opposite conclusion.\n\nI should add that the Phoenix Center does not make their funding sources public.\n\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dkdbkqb", "post_id": "6nu91f", "comment": "for reference, according to [this study](https://www.statista.com/statistics/183635/number-of-households-in-the-us/) there are about 126 million households in the united states of america.\n\nThese three corporations have spent so much money trying to buy Congress's favor, they could have literally given one million dollars to your household, yes, your family and every other family out there- and still come out *with a profit*.  \n\nInstead, they're spending that money trying to squeeze you for more money.\n\nBut by all means, keep telling me how socialism is evil."}, {"comment_id": "dkcl5ww", "post_id": "6nu91f", "comment": "And with a bit of luck, it'll be wasted."}, {"comment_id": "dkcm0oh", "post_id": "6nu91f", "comment": "The next time someone tries to tell you net neutrality is not really a big deal, remember that figure and how this expense is a good investment for them, given what is at stake."}, {"comment_id": "dkcmb8u", "post_id": "6nu91f", "comment": "Instead of trying to control the entire market, why don't they just focus on providing a decent product?"}, {"comment_id": "dkcmz7l", "post_id": "6nu91f", "comment": "If we all  (without contracts) cancelled our service the same day they would recant."}, {"comment_id": "dkcoalq", "post_id": "6nu91f", "comment": "Over half a billion to waste and i still have to pay $75 a month for shitty internet."}, {"comment_id": "dkcorqf", "post_id": "6nu91f", "comment": "But why don't they just use that to invest in their infrastructure"}, {"comment_id": "dkcux06", "post_id": "6nu91f", "comment": "Lol\n\nComcast's Twitter is all about fighting for Net Neutrality.

The only claim this has any impact on is the totalistic claim that net neutrality stops businesses from expanding infrastructure which is now demonstrably false.  \n\nEffectively there's no control, nothing to test against, and no way of knowing for sure what the result of each of these would be regarding the claims made.  We had no net neutrality for a long time and that oversaw many widespread developments and expansion of services and improvement of networks and the demand for it has only increased.  You could argue, for example, that the industry would've seen even more expansion both for small and large scale ISPs if we didn't have net neutrality.

As silly as it is that we have things called regulatory captures, those were the rules that people have been playing by for decades.\n\nAgain, playing Devil's Advocate: everyone is doing it, so nobody feels like they can't do it. \n\nJust delay the vote, and invite all the experts, and everyone can talk. Big ISP's should have a voice, but they shouldn't have the only voice. \n\nThe problem we have isn't necessarily corruption. Corruption has always existed. The problem is we swing back and forth wildly from the two sides of the political spectrum.\n\nJust delay the vote, and invite everyone to speak their minds on it.\n\nI personally fall into the trap of hyperbole all the time, but right now everyone feels like they have to scream and shout. I don't think these guys are bad people, it's just they only have the business side knowledge. Being patently and brutally honest, Pai and Verizon are business logic guys. They need to bring the technology logic guys to the table, and they need to work this out.\n\nJust delay the vote, and address all of the issues. Even if it doesn't change anyone's mind, at least it is a democratic process.\n\nThe problem is we aren't doing the democratic process.\n\nIf they all sit together at the table, and the spend months hashing things out, and their minds aren't changed then, then that's ok.\n\nI really dislike how we see consistently from Conservatives in our country a need to repeal ALL regulations.\n\nIt's so stupid. There are certain regulations we need. Adam Smith, the guy who wrote the book on Capitalism, said so himself.\n\nMaybe you don't repeal all of the Net Neutrality rules, but only part of it, and keep others. (I'm not saying that's the solution, but they have to do some sort of compromise.)\n\nPart of the problem we have is our winner take all mentality. \n\nRemember, it's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game.\n\nedit: Also, these guys have been getting death threats. We are drawing divisions around each other we don't need to have. Whether or not we disagree feverishly with their ideology, death threats are never ok. The bottom line is, both sides need to take a step back, take a deep breathe, and everyone needs to sit down and say, this is what the internet is, and this is what the Net Neutrality is all about. Alternatively, ISP's could just take the go ahead and say, \"We won't throttle speeds, and we won't censor certain things.\" Should we trust them, I don't know. But what I do know is this is so very important, and if the process is messed up, then things will end up bad.\n\nLook, Pai is not a bad guy. He's just a lawyer. In my opinion, we just have way to many lawyers. I honestly seriously believe they think what they are saying, in which case it will benefit all to just sit together at the same table, and talk it out. I think the best way to do this, is to order a bunch of Apple Pie, some Ice Cream, and a bunch of wine, and just sit back, relax, and do it tipsy. Not drunk, just slightly tipsy, and remember we are all Americans and we are in this together.

What happened?\n\n>The public response to the settlement has been overwhelming. *Millions* of people have visited this site in just the first week. Because the **total amount available for these alternative payments is $31 million**, each person who takes the money option is going to get a very small amount.

At best, that's `$31M / 147M people = $0.21 per person`.\n\nAlso, the statement is essentially blaming people for being too reactive and choosing compensation.  If \"millions\" of people have already visiting in the first week, and we take the smallest amount to make that possible (1M) then that's `$31M / 1M people = $31.00 per person`.\n\nAssuming the maximum number of people would take the \"alternative payment\" for how much was allocated, then that means they expected `$31M / $125 per person = 248000 people` to ask for the basic compensation.  That's 0.169% of the people affected!\n\nLet's pretend the full $425M were available: Now `$425M / $125 per person = 3.4M people` which means, in the most \"ideal\" situation, they expected only 2.31% of affected people to request the *minimum* financial compensation they were originally offering.\n\nAll that leads me to: how did they come up with $125 in the first place?

They overcharge, they don\u2019t really innovate, and they give preferential treatment to big business. For about 10 years, there has been the alternative idea of mesh networking, where we get rid of ISPs and, instead, have Internet messages relayed directly \u2014 person-to-person, laptop-to-phone-to-laptop. Theoretically, this completely solves the problems caused by ISPs. So, why hasn\u2019t it succeeded?\n\nThe reason is that inside of one city, it works fine; but when you need to send a message, say, from Toronto to Sydney, that\u2019s 15,000 kilometers, or 45,000 cell phone and laptop hops, even with optimal hardware. Even that assumes there are nodes going all along the ocean. It\u2019s obviously far too slow and expensive. We need large, undersea cables and professional infrastructure for international routing. So, here\u2019s the new solution: incentivized mesh networking. Anyone can join the network as a node. Anyone can charge for being a relay node for other people\u2019s messages. And if I want to send a request to some server, I run a graph-search algorithm to find the shortest, cheapest path. So, if you pay a few microcents per kilobyte, your messages get transferred. If you have a phone, you can participate in the network and get a few cents an hour. Large companies can also participate. I could start a company whose sole purpose is to run and maintain a single wire going from Vancouver to Melbourne and collect fees off that. If my wire is the fastest, cheapest way to get messages over, people will use it. If I filter traffic from Wikileaks, then Wikileaks users can just use someone else\u2019s wire instead.\n\nThe result is maximum modularity, minimum barrier to entry, an optimal marketplace. This allows you to incorporate satellites, undersea cables, intercity cables, phones, and more all into one network. That\u2019s how we fix the Internet\u2019s issues of monopoly and net neutrality.\n\nAnd this could be done on Ethereum?\n\nEthereum could be a part of the solution. Or you could use similar principles and do it independently. OpenGarden is trying on their own, and I think some group in Israel is trying this on Ethereum.\"\n\nhttp://www.shareable.net/blog/meet-vitalik-buterin-the-20-year-old-who-is-decentralizing-everything"}, {"comment_id": "dfb9865", "post_id": "611ltz", "comment": "How does this not violate laws like HIPPA etc?  \nFor example, if I look up a disease I have, go to sites that speak about that disease, ISP sells that information, and I begin getting targeted ads for cures to said disease, isn't that a violation?"}, {"comment_id": "dfb3t28", "post_id": "611ltz", "comment": "This is literally just like South Park.

Reg. 87274 (December 2, 2016)), and such rule shall have no force or effect.\n\nThis bill is invalidating the FCC ruling from 12/2/16 that says this:\nhttps://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/12/02/2016-28006/protecting-the-privacy-of-customers-of-broadband-and-other-telecommunications-services\n\n> In this document, the Federal Communications Commission (Commission) adopts final rules based on public comments applying the privacy requirements of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to broadband Internet access service (BIAS) and other telecommunications services. In adopting these rules the Commission implements the statutory requirement that telecommunications carriers protect the confidentiality of customer proprietary information. The privacy framework in these rules focuses on transparency, choice, and data security, and provides heightened protection for sensitive customer information, consistent with customer expectations. The rules require carriers to provide privacy notices that clearly and accurately inform customers; obtain opt-in or opt-out customer approval to use and share sensitive or non-sensitive customer proprietary information, respectively; take reasonable measures to secure customer proprietary information; provide notification to customers, the Commission, and law enforcement in the event of data breaches that could result in harm; not condition provision of service on the surrender of privacy rights; and provide heightened notice and obtain affirmative consent when offering financial incentives in exchange for the right to use a customer's confidential information. The Commission also revises its current telecommunications privacy rules to harmonize today's privacy rules for all telecommunications carriers, and provides a tailored exemption from these rules for enterprise customers of telecommunications services other than BIAS.\n\nThe FCC ruling was very logical privacy protection that makes little sense to remove other than helping the corporations while screwing over the customers. \n\nThanks to u/krypt_o for the bill text\n"}, {"comment_id": "dfbdpdi", "post_id": "611ltz", "comment": "Well, I guess we don't have to worry about being hacked anymore, since our info can just be bought.

We're not their target with the removal of Net Neutrality. Their interest, just as before, is targeting streaming services that directly compete against their TV division and on-demand market share. They hate Netflix. This was [extremely apparent in 2014](https://www.cnet.com/news/comcast-vs-netflix-is-this-really-about-net-neutrality/) when talks about Net Neutrality really started to take shape. \n\nNow, the FCC is controlled by a Verizon shill who's more about ensuring that the service providers are free to control the Internet, killing off any sort of freedoms we currently enjoy on it. Ajit Pai sides completely with the corporations about this argument and completely ignores public opinion. This is Comcast's chance to really put the pressure on those services that are causing everyone to become cord-cutters. This is their chance to try and bring back people who canceled their cable subscriptions by removing the competition. I believe this is their actual goal, at least for now.

"}, {"comment_id": "drmmyo6", "post_id": "7li4vl", "comment": "Just so everyone understands how ignorant members of congress are, this is an email I just received from representative Steve Womack (R):\n\n>Thank you for contacting me regarding net neutrality.  It is good to hear from you.\n\n >In November of this year, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai announced his intent to roll back Obama-era regulations on Internet service providers (ISPs).  On December 14, 2017, the FCC voted 3-2 on the Restoring Internet Freedom proposal.  While the former administration and its FCC Chairman, Tom Wheeler, touted these now overturned regulations as creating \u201cnet neutrality,\u201d we have seen them to be heavy-handed, creating an oppressive environment to surround the Internet. \n\n >Now, many myths are circling about what will happen to the Internet without these increased regulations.  While I may not have a crystal ball, I can tell you how the Internet fared prior to 2015: well.  After implementation of net neutrality, however, investment in broadband dropped over five percent, and has stayed there since.  This is jarring, considering investment in the Internet had not dropped in a non-recession year until this time.  Additionally, start-ups and rural area providers have struggled with the lack of capital expenditures and thus been disproportionately burdened, stifling competition and leading to uncertain futures for those still without Internet access.  Reversing this course will restore confidence to investors, allow start-ups a chance to grow, and give rural carriers the ability to continue bringing affordable Internet connection to underserved areas.   \n\n >A second point of focus has been that of \u201cthrottling,\u201d or slowing a customer\u2019s Internet, while possibly even charging them a premium to consume certain online content.  This practice did not happen before the Obama administration, and it will not happen after the roll-back of these rules.  In fact, with the reversal of the FCC power grab, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) will police anti-consumer and antitrust activities, as it has done since the Clinton Administration, the FCC will enforce a transparency rule requiring ISPs to divulge activities like throttling to the FCC and FTC, and the FTC will then investigate ISPs for any divergence from what they say.  \n\n >The final major misconception is that Chairman Pai and the FCC\u2019s actions will allow ISPs to stifle freedom of speech and steal personal information.  Contrary to many claims, net neutrality has not protected free speech, with one example being Representative Marsha Blackburn\u2019s (TN-7) Senate ad campaign that was barred by Twitter on grounds that it was \u201cinflammatory.\u201d This instance and others have shown that some actually peg the reversal of net neutrality rules as an end to Internet free speech, while having engaged in that exact condemned behavior beforehand.  Additionally, Congress passed S.J. Res. 34 on March 28, 2017. It soon after was signed into law, and thus gave power back to the FTC to regulate anti-consumer and antitrust behavior.  Congress will continue working to ensure all Internet entities are held to the same standard.    \n\n >Yes, the FCC and Chairman Pai are killing the Internet as we know it today, but only so we can go back to its most successful self.  The Internet will again be monitored by multiple agencies targeting bad actors rather than exist longer under this two-year experiment that stifled a whole industry.  Start-ups and providers targeting underserved areas, like many in the Third District, will benefit from the renewed confidence investors will have in our Internet, and the competition will keep costs competitive once again.

She has no understanding of the business model her own company uses because the vocal minority of Reddit is what produces the content to attract the majority to the site.\n2. She is so out of touch with the community that she makes comments like this and doesn't have the wisdom to know that they will not be received well.\n\nThe CEO of a company should never make comments like this.  It's self-serving and protectionist.  It lowers yourself into the weeds AND is ultimately harmful to the company (most importantly).  She would have been better off saying nothing from a PR standpoint.\n\nThis just builds on the fact that they let a key face of the company go abruptly and unexpectedly without any kind of coordinated message.  This is very basic PR.  If you have a well known employee who you want to terminate (for whatever reason) then you need to have them issue a statement that makes it sound like they're pursuing better opportunity and it was their choice to leave (in exchange for either a golden parachute or not disclosing whatever horrible thing they did depending on the situation).  So it's another case of Chairman Pao is showing incompetence in the basic mechanics of how to run a business.  It's no wonder she didn't make partner at her last job because so far everyone is wondering how she ever got the one she has now.\n\nThe big thing that people on the board of Reddit Inc need to understand is that Reddit is what it is because it gets out of the users way and people in turn choose to build vibrant communities on it.  Between the censorship and shadow banning and the desire to control the AMA process so that guests can have pre-screened questions (which would just turn AMA into a CNN interview) the community is upset because we like Reddit and all remember what happened to Digg.  We don't want to see a Voat post in a year saying Reddit has been bought by Dice for an embarrassing amount of money.  \n\nThis is a case where the majority of the community that actively makes Reddit a top 100 website is trying to help keep Reddit from making self-destructive decisions.

The pageviews are in the billions, the MAU are in the hundreds of millions.\n\nLet's assume: 85% of those MAU are just readers. 10% are commenters. 5% are submitters.\n\nThose are the numbers I made up, and they may not be accurate, but I think they are probably a good overall pattern to judge the site. Most of the folks are totally disinterested in the nitty gritty politics of the site because they are just passive readers. They view reddit as a place for cat memes and interesting news. They come here for the CONTENT and not the IDENTITY.\n\nBut here's the problem, that CONTENT is being created by the 15% that comprise the commenters and the submitters. They are ones bringing in the clickbaity titles and the superfresh news and the memes and the pun threads, everything we love about reddit. Those are a more passionate and hardcore crowd, the ones who view reddit as IDENTITY, and those are the ones who are currently frothing for various reasons.\n\nShe's right, the 85% probably won't be swayed by everything that's going on and won't leave for political reasons, but what if the 15% is and does?\n\nWithout the content, the 85% will leave too.

He was a lawyer for, was it Verizon?  This was his appointed job, which I assume he was well paid for, to kill NN.\n\nSo this asshole goes about his job, ignoring ad even faking the comments.\n\nThen he goes about killing NN.\n\nThis can't have been a surprise to anyone.  It's like putting DeVos in charge of Education.  Or Pruitt in charge of the EPA.  Or all of the other cabinet picks (not that this was a Cabinet office) and other positions where Trump, with someone telling him to - he doesn't know the details of this stuff.  Like he could be bothered.\n\nSo now we're about to lose NN and Pai is giving evasive answers?  When was the last time any of these Swamp Monsters didn't get up in front of Congress an evade?\n\nAll we can hope is that we win the mids, and then get a 60+ in the Senate come 2020 to that we can try to unwind some of the damages they're doing.\n\nI don't want to say this is the least of it, because it is truly important.  But look at all of the other things this administration had undone.  We're about to lose large pieces of our public lands so that private corporations can go into and rape the land.  Once that starts there's no stopping it, from what I understand.\n\nIf yo look at what they're doing, as a whole, it is devastating.  And while NN is truly important, it's almost as if it a public smoke-screen to cover all of the other nefarious things they are doing.\n\nI see NK or Iran in the same light.  I don't know if we really had a chance with NK.  I do know that Bolton was dead-set against it and did his best ti undermine it.  Yeah, NK was probably just playing their usual bullshit games.  But Bolton was intent on fucking that up.\n\nEven more, he was never going to let the Iran deal sit.  That's way too complicated to it all into this post.  But Bolton wants wars.  Trumps needs wars.\n\nThere's nothing like a war, on the ground, to make Amrican's rally round their leader.  You'd think after more than 15 years and Afghanistan and a bit less in Iraq (Now Syria, Yemen, etc...) that we as a country would have the same fatigue we did with Vietnam.  \n\nGranted, there aren't 55K dead.  They aren't being shown on the nightly news.  as a country, I think we've become inured to the low-speed, high-drag, warfare.  It just doesn't register.  Not after so many years.\n\nI wish it did.  I saw where Gillibrand, I think it was, but I could be wrong, just introduced a bill that said the AUMF doesn't hold true for Iran.  If you want to go to war with them you're going to have to do it by the Constitution.  That is, we'll have a debate and then exercise our given prerogatives if we'll go to war or not.\n\nIt'll fail.  I think.\n\nAnd then Trump will get his war, somewhere, to distract the country from his criminal bullshit. You can be sure someone like Rudy will say, he's much too busy protecting our country (from a war that wasn't needed, we didn't want, and is going to cost us a ton of money.  It's also one we might lose.  Unless we go in with everything short of nukes.  We don't have the troops to fight the wars we're fighting.  And Iran is kind of a natural fortress.  They've certainly built it up that way.) from terror and threat.\n\nI'm done.  I'm so sick of these games that are being constructed for the possible protection of a criminal piece of shit that never should have gotten within a 100 miles radius of the Office.\n\nBTW:  I don't usually go this far, but I've had enough.  If you voted for Trump, fuck you.  Sure, I know there are a few of you that are going, damn, that's not what I wanted.  Fuck you in particular.  He made it very clear what he wanted to do.  He wasn't the typical politician talking in politician speak.  \"Yeah, that's why we like him!\"  But did you bother to hear what he said and done of the last 30+ years?  He never his any of it.  But you ignored it.  Or you liked it.  This is on you, you MAGA fucks.\n\nThe WORST PRESIDENT in HISTORY.  Because you hated that the Black man, considerate, thoughtful, gracious that he was.  Was he perfect?  No.  Did he have to battle scandal, no.  Make up your own little scandal sheet you miserable motherfuckers.

A folder titled simply \u2018reddit\u2019 houses 170 GBs of data apparently scraped from several subreddits, including the controversial r/fatpeoplehate that was home to a community of people who posted pictures of people and mocked them for their weight before it was banned from Reddit\u2019s platform in 2015. Other subreddits that appear to have been scraped by Deep Root or a partner organization focused on more benign topics, like mountain biking and the Spanish language.\n\n>The Reddit data could\u2019ve been used as training data for an artificial intelligence algorithm focused on natural language processing, or it might have been harvested as part of an effort to match up Reddit users with their voter registration records. During the 2012 election cycle, Barack Obama\u2019s campaign data team relied on information gleaned from Facebook profiles and matched profiles to voter records.\n\n>During the 2016 election season, Reddit played host to a legion of Trump supporters who gathered in subreddits like r/The_Donald to comb through leaked Democratic National Committee emails and craft pro-Trump memes. Trump himself participated in an \u201cAsk Me Anything\u201d session on r/The_Donald during his campaign.\n\n>Given how active some Trump supporters are on Reddit\u2014r/The_Donald currently boasts more than 430,000 members\u2014it makes sense that Trump\u2019s data team might be interested in analyzing data from the site.\n\n>A FiveThirtyEight analysis that looked at where r/The_Donald members spend their time when they\u2019re not talking politics might shed some light onto why Deep Root collected r/fatpeoplehate data. FiveThirtyEight found that, when Redditors weren\u2019t commenting in r/The_Donald or other political subreddits, they most often frequented r/fatpeoplehate.\n\n>It\u2019s possible that Deep Root intended to use data from r/fatpeoplehate to build a more comprehensive profile of Trump voters. (Lundry declined to comment beyond his initial statement on any of information included in the Deep Root dataset.)\n\n>However, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s investigation doesn\u2019t account for Deep Root\u2019s collection of data from mountain-biking and Spanish-speaking subreddits that weren\u2019t as popular with r/The_Donald members\u2014and data from these subreddits that are not so closely linked to Trump\u2019s diehard supporters might be more useful for his campaign\u2019s goal of pursuing swing voters.\n\n>\u201cMy guess is that they were scraping Reddit posts to match to the voter file as another input for individual modeling,\u201d a source familiar with campaign data operations told Gizmodo. \u201cGiven the number of random forums, my guess is they started with a list of accounts to scrape from, rather than scraping from all forums then trying to match from there (in which case you\u2019d start with the political ones).\u201d\n\n>Matching voter records with Reddit usernames would be complicated and any large-scale effort would likely result in many inaccuracies, the source said. However, campaigns have attempted to match voter files with social media profiles in the past. Such an effort by Deep Root wouldn\u2019t be entirely surprising, and would likely yield rich data on the small portion of users it was able to match with their voter profiles, the source explained."}, {"comment_id": "dj3to0d", "post_id": "6i6bdq", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "dj3salj", "post_id": "6i6bdq", "comment": "Whoops!

Google upgraded the service lines, and made basic 5mbps internet available for free after a $5 signup fee to all residential customers in the city (idk if the free option is still available). Gigabit from that service was half the cost of 50mpbs from Comcast at the time, so we went with the upgraded plan, and it was great. \n\nTLDR; Provo tried the municipally owned fiber internet infrastructure, failed, nobody used it, Google bought it for a dollar, and it flourished. Hope this community doesn't have the same problems and end up with outside ownership anyways.

These led to the enactment of the Fair Credit Reporting Act in the same year which gave consumers rights regarding information stored about them in corporate databanks.

At the time, The Work Number was happily flying under the radar and being very \"out there\" about the way they resell this data.  This includes:\n\n- allowing debt collectors to access the data.  Now, when this 2013 stuff started getting mindshare, in an excellent display of how scummy Equifax is, they very indignantly stated that the Red Tape article was false and they don't allow debt collectors to access your salary information.  But that's only partially true.  While a debt collector can't look up exactly how much you're making, a debt collector CAN find out that you have a job, where that job is, then send in a file with a list of prospects and how much they owe, which Equifax will then return a score on.  So, of course, the less you owe and the more you make, the higher the score and the first you are in line for collection efforts.\n\n- even creeper IMHO: for high-dollar companies that have high-income clients, they will allow those companies to send in a list of clients, and Equifax will alert them if any of those clients lose their jobs or their income changes significantly.  I'd imagine this is used by places like casinos extensively so they don't unknowingly keep giving freebies to \"deadbeats\" that won't be buying anything else.\n\nThe original service is arguably a good one, because it makes salary verification processes quite more streamlined and foolproof.

I studied the social sciences but I am no expert on where this will go. One of you mentioned social engineering.\n\n\nThe Atlantic\n\n\"Bots (short for software robots) have been around since the early days of computers. One compelling example of bots is chatbots, algorithms designed to hold a conversation with a human, as envisioned by Alan Turing in the 1950s.33 The dream of designing a computer algorithm that passes the Turing test has driven artificial intelligence research for decades, as witnessed by initiatives like the Loebner Prize, awarding progress in natural language processing.a Many things have changed since the early days of AI, when bots like Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA,39 mimicking a Rogerian psychotherapist, were developed as demonstrations or for delight.\n\nToday, social media ecosystems populated by hundreds of millions of individuals present real incentives\u2014including economic and political ones\u2014to design algorithms that exhibit human-like behavior. Such ecosystems also raise the bar of the challenge, as they introduce new dimensions to emulate in addition to content, including the social network, temporal activity, diffusion patterns, and sentiment expression. A social bot is a computer algorithm that automatically produces content and interacts with humans on social media, trying to emulate and possibly alter their behavior. Social bots have inhabited social media platforms for the past few years\n\nWhat are the intentions of social bots? Some of them are benign and, in principle, innocuous or even helpful: this category includes bots that automatically aggregate content from various sources, like simple news feeds. Automatic responders to inquiries are increasingly adopted by brands and companies for customer care. Although these types of bots are designed to provide a useful service, they can sometimes be harmful, for example when they contribute to the spread of unverified information or rumors. Analyses of Twitter posts around the Boston marathon bombing revealed that social media can play an important role in the early recognition and characterization of emergency events.11 But false accusations also circulated widely on Twitter in the aftermath of the attack, mostly due to bots automatically retweeting posts without verifying the facts or checking the credibility of the source.20\""}, {"comment_id": "dnvbwxn", "post_id": "743jxw", "comment": "And this is exactly why the internet is such a dangerous medium these days. Corporations, lobbyists and other malicious organizations have realized its potential as a tool for propaganda and are using it as such -- disturbingly effectively. \n\nHere's my personal opinion on why I think it's so dangerously effective:\n\n1. It is a completely virtual medium which can easily, cheaply and extremely quickly convey information. It's very easy to reach an extreme level of exposure compared to traditional media, by using bots for example.\n2. Because of its interactive nature, people *choose* what they see, read and hear. This happens consciously as well as subconsciously, which means the information they are exposed to on hot button topics is biased and incomplete because of people's preconceptions. People choose to read and watch things that validate and enforce their views.\n3. Because more and more content on the internet is user generated, more and more information people receive is incomplete, incorrect and skewed, both unintentionally because of bias and ignorance as well as intentionally by people feeding misinformation that suits their personal views or agenda.\n4. Because of the trend mentioned in point 3, malicious organizations have unprecedented power to feed people misinformation and influence their views and opinions by having bots impersonate real people. They can manipulate and create content on sites like Reddit. They can disguise lies as truths, propaganda as science fact. They can pose as lots of real people voicing their opinions, manipulating our view of the rest of the population. Propaganda is becoming increasingly convincing because of this.\n5. Maybe most importantly: **Most people are partially or completely unaware of these things**. People around the world are used to the old media, like newspapers and TV. Those media are **monitored and held accountable**, at least to a certain degree and in developed, democratic countries in particular. Professional journalists have good intentions and a strong work ethic, striving for true impartiality, objectivity and full disclosure. People in developed countries are used to taking information from these media at face value, without much skepticism. They implicitly trust it to be correct. The internet is none of these things, obviously but the vast majority treats it the same. People need to be trained, drilled even to **question everything** they read on the net, especially concerning hot button topics. They need to be taught to check for sources when reading news. They need to be taught how to assess the credibility and trustworthiness of sources of information.\n\nLet's hope these issues can still be considered growing pains of the internet, as a new technology that has become too large and powerful way too quickly for society to adapt.\n\nEDIT: Thanks for the gold stranger, much appreciated!"}, {"comment_id": "dnvjngm", "post_id": "743jxw", "comment": "This is like big tobacco saying cigarettes are healthy.

This would be in conjunction with further legislation outlawing the practice of local internet monopolies (including practices wherein one company owns all the fiber or owns the exclusive rights to use the existing fiber in the area) and a massive infrastructure bill for new federal investment in web infrastructure (reinforcing the existing infrastructure and building new infrastructure) while using the power of eminent domain to sieze control of the existing infrastructure in the interest of the public good. It'd be an unprecedented seizure to be sure, but one that would serve in the public interest as removing control of that infrastructure from private companies allows for access to be doled out on a case by case basis to any company that can provide competent service at a reasonable price (removing the extremely steep initial starting cost that comes with building a network in an area)\n"}, {"comment_id": "dpvzom4", "post_id": "7d6ujp", "comment": "You want violence Pai?

The utilities that are installing the NHGs throughout your city will likely use a subscription plan provided to the vendors of the products for use by their customers.\n\nCellular is slightly different, but ideally, cellular will eventually make up a smaller amount of traffic than IoT device traffic simply due to the amount of IoT hitting the market over the next.\n\nMost people will be on 4G for cellular for the foreseeable future as there are only a few cities that even have partial 5G coverage. Rural areas will likely never see 5G.\n\n&#x200B;"}, {"comment_id": "ehk09mw", "post_id": "aw4psl", "comment": "No, it will not be crazy fast. Hear me out.\n\nLTE is already crazy fast.

They won't accomplish this by being stingy with data though.  The goal is to do to DOCSIS connections what wireless has already done to landlines, which is to enroll individuals as customers rather than households.  If they cannot do this, then the infrastructure investment will not be worth it, since modern LTE already handles the current mobile data paradigms reasonably well.

So instead of that thing I want taking up the network traffic for lets say 30 seconds, it will now take 30 minutes or more on my throttled connection.  So instead of the traffic taking up the less than minute on 4G, I'll keep their tower occupied for much much longer because they want to arbitrarily reduce consumption of the service or to charge me more.
