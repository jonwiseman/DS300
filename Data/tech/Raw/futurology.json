Even if you change atmospheric carbon levels it won't matter much at this point.  The fact is the carbon sinkage on the Earth is irrevocably changed.  The air conditioner of the Earth, to use a metaphor, is broken. You can't turn off the melting of the ice caps and tundra at this point. \n\nThe amount of methane trapped in melting ice and tundra far exceeds human emissions. The increase in humidity from the what temperature changes we've already baked is what is driving the climate now. Being carbon neutral doesn't solve the problem it just slows the rate of change. Going carbon zero, as in if all humans disappeared, still won't return the planet to pre industrial levels. The planet is warming in feedback now. No scientist is talking about stopping the warming of the Earth anymore it's just mitigating the RATE of warming. Humans will fall back into the dark ages just this time it won't be from a ice age but because of famine and war.  The question is just will it be in 50 years or 400.  One of the problems is that over the last 30 years there are less scientists and more \"technologists\" in the world. Technology has never solved a problem without creating an expected problem. And technologists see problems as profit-centers.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere is some real science for you:  \n\n\nEventually parts of the planet will be so warm your lungs will be relatively \"cool\" and when you breath in the humidity in the air will condense in your lungs and you'll slowly drown. Just by breathing. This can happen in less than an hour just by breathing. This will happen in your lifetime in places around the globe. Even if you stopped shopping online and stopped driving your car today.  \n\n\nIf you want to really understand how stupid \"technologists\" versions of humans are just look at the doorway to hell. Technologists thought that would only burn for a few weeks... and that was 50 years ago. And it's still burning.  Elon really thought the hyperloop is pratical and that a inflatable prophylactic would help get those kids out of that cave.  \n\n\nStop fucking listening to technologists or your lives will really, really suffer. They are selling you something. That's all they are doing is selling you something. Hyperloop is absurd. The Boring company build the least efficient subway system in the history of subway systems. Mars is (as of today) an impossibility. We have no way to get there and no way to handle the radiation on the way there and once we are there we'd have to terraform an entire planet... and currently we can't even make slight temperature modifications to our own.\n\n  \nIf you want to save the planet for your kids, get a needle and thread and start mending your clothes - stop buying clothes as they are all shipped in from around the world, stop eating beef, walk or ride a bicycle everywhere. Move into the city. Don't take trips. Don't buy anything that has plastic packaging. If you aren't willing to do all of that then just enjoy driving your car and don't have kids.   \n\n\nBy the time humans \"discovered\" HIV in the 1980s it had already been infecting people for 70 years.

Natural disasters, melting icecaps, the whole shebang. And I dont think that people and corporations are willing to change on that level. We are too attached to modern comforts that we would have to give up to truly change the way the world is going. Companies are going to keep pumping carbon I to the atmosphere, the caps are going to keep melting, florida is going to be submerged in the ocean, California will keep burning. If we want to stop it we need a complete rejection of the current system. Economical, political- all of it, it's all so connected, you cant get rid of one without the other. But the likelyhood of that is almost zero, unless the protests in France spark something, and God I hope they do. \nThe point is, western civilization is on such a cycle of consumption, year after year, always wanting more, and faster - always faster.\nWe are going to reach a point where you cant order a macbook and have it delivered in two days with free shipping. \nYou won't be able to go to the grocery store and get tomatoes 365 days a year. It's just not sustainable. It cant be. Not at the rate we consume such products. \nWe need to commit to real, substantial  change.\n\nStuff like recycling is great, but only about half of things you might recycle at home actually gets recycled. Its worse now that China has stopped accepting imports of it.\nIn addition, no matter how much you or I might recycle, or save on waste, it's the corporations and companies that contribute the most. And the awful part is that with how corporations act, with all the power they have, they dont care. So much food gets thrown out by grocery stores every day. So much waste is created. And there are no signs of it slowing down. I'm glad Elon musk is being optimistic, but I sincerely find it hard to be. The way things are going, I'm anticipating an environmental collapse, or massive shift in the next fifteen-twenty five years. I'm not a scientist - but from what I observe and the facts I know, I cant see it any other way. The environmental disasters are already growing bigger, and more impactful. I see florida going under in the next fifteen years ish. \nSorry to be a downer, but I can not see a world where everyone has a phone they can browse reddit on 24/7. Or where every building has internet. Unless there is a class based political revolution, things will not change. It's all connected.

Here's why:\n\nReddit, for example, is only accessible over the infrastructure big cable companies built and own. If you want to have your own internet, fine. But here are some of the things you'll have to deal with:\n\nProblem 1 - You build your first, locally owned cable line. HOORAY! You now have internet between A---------B. What sites exist at those two points? Fucking. Nothing. Reddit? Noooope. Google? Nooooope. Netflix? Noooope. Any of the sites you regularly go to? Noooope. All of the sites we use today are only accessible through the infrastructure big cable companies built and own. You currently access them by paying these companies to use their lines to reach the places these sites are hosted. If you want access to those sites, you're going to have to convince these companies to allow a junction between your \"internet\" and their cable lines. Why, on Earth, would they ever allow you to use their lines for less than what you currently pay monthly as an individual? They're going to make you lease the lines from them for at an extremely high rate, because you are now effectively a cable company in their eyes. \n\nProblem 2 - If you want to access those sites and use their lines, you're still impacted in exactly the same way by net-neutrality(or lack thereof) than if you hadn't essentially started a cable company at all. Ultimately they still control the reigns. \n\nProblem 3 - To get around problems 1 and 2, there is only one option. Constantly be snap-shotting every site that exists, and as they change, in real time. I cannot stress enough how MONUMENTAL that task is. Which means if you're *not* doing that, or doing it on a smaller scale for a few frequently used sites, you will always be looking at a past, incomplete version of them or, you won't have access to them at all. And you STILL need at least 1 person who pays the cable company to access the sites to get the snapshots. \n\nIt sounds good to fantasize about owning your own \"internet.\" But it brings immense cost and complication that will only result in you becoming what you sought to escape, a cable company.

I'm shamelessly going to take this opportunity and recommend a few things:\n\n1. Take the time and really read about political theory. This stuff can be hard to wrap your head around, so really dig in until you feel that you understand the differences between the main ideologies. Learning the difference between social democracy, socialism, communism, anarchism and (left) libertarianism, and being able to explain them when asked is a great way to counter the rampant but baseless fear of anything left of centre, and to increase public understanding of what the alternatives are. If you live in a country with several choices of left wing parties that are likely to get influence, it can be a good idea to vote further left than you would otherwise do, to pull the country further to the left, provided that the party you vote for isn't likely to come in under the parliament barrier. \n\n\n2. Read *This Changes Everything* by Naomi Klein. This is a great book that analyses the way capitalism affects the planet and proposes a reason as to why climate change denial is so prevalent in the US. An all around great critique of capitalism and its effects.\n\n3. Tangentially related: Reduce your carbon footprint by thinking twice about any purchase you make, and when you do buy things, only buying second hand. Recycle your trash, eat plants and mushrooms instead of meat and milk, and use a bike or public transport when possible instead of driving or flying. Its easier than you think!\n\nThank you for reading, take care and have a nice day!\n"}, {"comment_id": "dqp3yx7", "post_id": "7h8z9v", "comment": ">This Scientist Wants to Bring Star Trek Values to Congress\n\nSeems like most members of Congress already  want to \"live long and prosper\". \n\nI'm not sure if they're interested in accomplishing much else beyond that."}, {"comment_id": "dqp8hv0", "post_id": "7h8z9v", "comment": "So if you don't like your congressman, ask him to wear a red shirt.

Similarly, if a person with a low risk to reoffend receives too much supervision/intervention, that person is more likely to reoffend.

I'm talking about risk assessments, which I see as the bigger issue, not facial recognition (a concern, and I'm sure one that is more relatable, especially on Reddit, but not fundamentally different from other forms of tracking we must contend with). While it's a nuanced subject, it's something that has become, through roundabout, if understandable, means, *almost* inseparable from the American legal system, medical community (in some respects, w.r.t. said system) and other mechanisms that determine the fates of real people, and the impacts cannot be easily understated. Yet we do not seem to have broadly recognized this remarkable transition. Fundamental changes to our system of justice and concept of rights have taken place without serious and general inspection.\n\nA principle component of my field (when I do forensic psychiatric work, or rather when I did clinical work on such cases) is all about risk (or \"risk\"). I'll use this as an illustration of broader trends. There are two things that are very clear to anyone taking an honest look at it: One, The threshold and formulation of \"risk\" is arbitrary, but universally low; Two, the criteria are so broad and simplistic as to make their application almost absurd. This is compounded by incessant demand for seer-like powers from the legal system (because it makes for convenient justifications for any kind of decision or policy) and by a staggering general lack of understanding of and insight into both the mathematics underlying and implications of how we use these assessments from lawyers, judges, law enforcement, clinical professionals and just about everyone else involved.\n\nIf that's a little vague and wordy, this should show what I mean by \"very clear\". [Here](http://hcr-20.com/hcr/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/HCR-V3-Rating-Sheet-1-page-CC-License-16-October-2013.pdf) is a one page form of 20 checklist items used by a person in an office to decide whether a patient in a psychiatric hospital has the right to be not in a psychiatric hospital. While a judge has the final say, they almost always defer to the opinion of the institution, and those institutions have internal and external pressures to not allow anyone to leave (and few meaningful pressures to protect those under their authority). I have recommended a number of people be kept or be subject to certain treatments, over their objection, and have usually had my requests granted. I felt some of those opinions where more justified than others, and some were unfairly based on policy on how to form that opinion. While I generally genuinely tried to do the \"right thing\", that isn't often clear. I can say with certainty I've been wrong, probably more than I've been right even.\n\nWhile there is some training in the use of this sheet, I should note that it is *explicitly and intentionally vague*. There are no formal definitions or measurements for the items listed, much less any that would carry generally applicable meaning that could withstand even a \"naive\" check of validity (which is why they are not further defined -- they can't be). A common situation would see a person that has had employment problems or a bad relationship or who has had a traumatic experience be denied release on grounds of \"dangerousness\", asserted from weak and poorly employed statistics. In an institution, unlike a normal prisoner, there is no \"max\" -- they can be and often are held indefinitely. \n\nAnd while this general form is somewhat outdated (depending on who you ask), whatever particular tool a given organization uses (if any! - seriously...) will be substantially similar. It, like others, was created by a few people that got their hands on general history and demographic information *gathered over large stretches of time and from different sources* and worked out which factors, as formulated by them (and often not open for scrutiny), were correlated with a negative outcomes like re-hospitalization, criminal involvement etc. I will note that this form is at least better than many in that it does not *outright* use age or marital status etc. as factors, but many do. The forms used in \"normal\" criminal cases are [worse still](https://theappeal.org/risk-assessment-explained). That  is a more general discussion of many of the fundamental problems in the formulation and application of these tools. The only reason race is not used is because there are legal prohibitions on doing so (and it is a cultural taboo), though factors that are divided, statistically, along racial lines are included in just about all of these sorts of forms. \n\nThat has become a rallying cry for some criticism of their use, but such complaints miss the forest for the trees. Risk assessments are inherently racist in the context of contemporary socio-economic realities. That isn't debatable - it's virtually by mathematical definition. But they are also ageist, and not-married-ist, and many other \"unfair\" and arbitrary qualities. In *general*, categorical population-based correlations can be made for many things; there is going to be a way to frame anyone as being higher or lower risk than someone else, which is all these forms can do. It doesn't mean they **actually have *any*** predictive power for a given individual and their specific characteristics and circumstances, let alone mean that it can be used as justification to impose consequences. \n\nWe can color the illustration with something familiar. The movie Minority Report has been widely seen around the world and its themes (whatever you think of the film itself) are well known. In the film (spoiler warning, I suppose) the fates of people in society are determined by oracles that, so it is at first asserted, flawlessly predict the future. \"Pre-crime\", determining who *is going to* do one thing or another, *preemtively* makes that person guilty and means they *deserve* punishment. Of course, if such a thing were possible to know, there mere knowledge of it would change the future (a major question in the film), and there is also the matter of \"what's the point, exactly\" inherent in punishing people, especially for things that can be avoided, but put all that aside. It turns out that the oracles are sometimes, though rarely, wrong. The system is exposed as a sham and the \"criminals\" are released. The reality we have is the inverse. We are *almost always wrong*, just better than we would be at picking and choosing blindly, yet find comfort in passing accountability off to an algorithm with all the same failings (at least) that a human evaluator would face. \n\nIn the context of hospital patients, the \"risk\" is very low anyway. Speaking about \"relatively moderate risk\"... doesn't impart an absolute number, even if we're ignoring the issues in the relevance of that assessment."}, {"comment_id": "f0my8na", "post_id": "d5gl19", "comment": "Holy shit something I agree with Sanders on?

Also to ensure that Trump doesn't change his mind about the Hyperloop tunnel between Baltimore and DC to be built by Boring.  This is Elon \"getting with the program\" (or rather, back with the program) for the sake of his companies (and, by extension, the planet).  On a side note.  I've noticed a change of tone in Elon recently.  Just this week he said that we would have AGI before narrow AI left millions of truck drivers out of work.  This is a seemingly darker Elon.  My guess is he is either increasingly pessimistic due to his inability to get AP2.0 to Level 4  on time and failing to meet production goals for the Model 3.  That or he is increasingly pessimistic due to his sense that he won't be able to establish a backup for humanity on Mars before Artificial Super Intelligence potentially blows everything up.

A few towns would hit the jackpot and the rest would be left to rot."}, {"comment_id": "di1ft20", "post_id": "6dap6v", "comment": "In this thread:  Lots of power industry experts making broad generalizations about people."}, {"comment_id": "di1bkno", "post_id": "6dap6v", "comment": "When it comes to ~~cola~~ coal miners wanting to keep their jobs, I think people are missing a few key pieces. It's not just about wanting coal, or wanting to keep their jobs. Coal mining is a huge part of many of these people's identities, but that isn't all of it.\n\nFor most of these people, it's that changing to another job isn't JUST the job. It's changing literally their entire life. The new energy jobs aren't in the same places as the old energy jobs. While this might not seem like a big deal to people who live in big cities, or even medium cities, it's actually a HUGE deal to people from small, rural towns.\n\nMost of these people have spent their entire life not only as coal miners, but as part of a community. They know everyone in town. Their parents and grandparents knew everyone in town. For generations, all these people have lived together. They've gone to school together, married their high school sweethearts, done the same activities with the same people for decades.\n\nIt's hard to explain the sense of community that comes from living in a small town like that to people who have never experienced it. It's not just a bunch of people living near to each other like it is in the city. It really is a community.\n\nTo give a couple simple examples: My stepdad grew up in a small farming community. He grew up in a house built by his grandfather, on the same land that his family had received when they came to the United States from Norway in the 1830s or 1840s. When he married my mom, they sent invitations to nearly everyone in town, until they had to stop because the church would be beyond capacity if they all turned up. On the day of the wedding, not only did everyone they invited turn up, but so did most of the people they didn't invite. People were standing next to the pews. There were chairs set up in the hallway and in the meeting areas. People stood around outside. In a town of 600, perhaps 500 people showed up for their wedding.\n\n5 or 6 years later, a classmate of mine died in a car accident. The same church had been expanded recently, and the people in attendance filled the entire expansion. Lots of businesses closed so the owners and workers could go to this kid's funeral. I don't think I've ever been to a larger funeral than this one for a 15 year old in a small farming town.\n\nWhen people say \"These coal miners just need training! They should move to where the jobs are!\", they think they're just talking about switching jobs. What they're really talking about is the breaking up of indescribably close-knit communities full of families who have been friends and relatives for generations. All they know is that life, and that community. It's everything to them, and they love it to death.\n\nChanging times and technologies will inevitably break up these towns. It's already broken up many of them, perhaps most. But can you really blame them for not wanting to lose it all?\n\nEdit: Apparently, cola is not mined, but actually comes from the kola nut, or from coca leaves. Coal is, in fact, what is mined. My post has been changed to reflect this fact.\n\nEdit 2: There seems to be a lot of confusion about what I mean with this. I'm absolutely not saying we should spend money and resources and risk more climate change just to let people like this keep living their life. The fact is, the era of coal is ending and these towns are going to die. The people there need to get new jobs in new towns. There's no question there.\n\nWhat I mean with this post is that we need to make sure we consider their humanity, and their life experiences. No one wants to feel like others don't care about their life and well-being. No one wants to feel like they're just some numbers on paper, who need to be reeducated and shuffled off to a different life in a different place, and treating people that way always has, and always will, end badly."}, {"comment_id": "di1g4kd", "post_id": "6dap6v", "comment": "My brother works as a \"wind farmer\", and there aren't that many jobs in the industry as many think, he has a hard time finding jobs that don't require ridiculous travel (i.e., staying in the US), and they pay poorly, high turnover.

The battery storage currently in existence is not even remotely capable of meeting demand and the technology to rapidly charge/discharge does not exist.  There is not enough lithium on earth to create enough batteries to store a day's worth of power for the US.

Some Sponsors want material that supports their position, not something that proves them wrong. \n\nAnyone who comes up with results contrary to the established consensus might not publish their results for fear of being ostracized. The history of scientific inquiry is filled with cases where someone posits an idea that is rejected harshly but only after their death do they find vindication. Due to this, there is an incentive to abandon results and worse yet change the results in order to be published. \n\nSo basically, the first problem is that corruption exists within the scientific community. False results can be manipulated into being by publishing and monetary incentives. \n\nThe second problem with \u201cScience\u201d is that our understanding of the universe is nowhere near as solid as people think. Anyone else remember the alarms raised by both scientists and politicians alike over climate change that have all turned out to be widely underperforming? Al Gore in his 2007 Nobel prize acceptance speech referenced two US government studies that found that the polar ice caps would be gone by 2021 or even 2014. There are many examples of this alarmist rhetoric, but that doesn\u2019t change the fact that everyone wanted to drastically reform society. The real thing to draw from this though is that we get things wrong more frequently than most people think. Just look at the changes that something like the field of nutrition has gone through in the last 50 years, and worldwide climate is even more complex than the inner workings of the digestive system.\n\nThe third problem is the sway of ideology. We will look back to this time as a dark age for science insofar how so many were duped into believing nonsense that was spewed by ideologically possessed researchers and scientists (which includes social sciences as well). \n\nRegardless of all this, people will cling to \u201cScience\u201d and will happily humiliate you for not being in line with the establishment even when it comes to hotly disputed issues that they\u2019ll treat with the same dismissal they treat flat earthers and antivaxxers with.

These cynics of course have their own problems that prevent dialogue, but I\u2019ve been ranting about the advocates because no one else will do it. \n\nOnly through honest dialogue that recognizes how both parties want the truth and the best for society can we truly suss out what is right and what is wrong in something as large as field of science or as small as a single experiment."}, {"comment_id": "epmci7q", "post_id": "bv72gv", "comment": "Too many social justice warriors masquerading as scientists."}, {"comment_id": "epmiz9w", "post_id": "bv72gv", "comment": "What is going on with these comments?

This won't happen, because the people running the biggest businesses, don't want this. I work with some of the biggest businesses and corporations in the US. I work with the ceos of said businesses. They don't want you happy. They talk about it all the time and it isn't really a secret. They aren't going to just come out and say it. However, when you run or own a company like say, Amazon or Wal-Mart. It is just as important that they have control over you outside of work, as it is while you're at work. They want you tired and burned out. Again, when you are a CEO of a multi billion dollar orginization, having full control over your workers is very important. They don't want you to have a ton of free time, because with that free time, you just may realize how shit of a deal you're getting, and try to organize against it.\n\nIf they can keep you tired and burned out, the odds you will fight back is much less than if you were well rested with free time on your hands. The people running those places basically get off when they can control you like that. They really enjoy their power, and more importantly, they like to use that power.\n\nWhat is more important to a CEO at a multi billion dollar venture. You being slightly more productive at work? Or, having control over you outside of work, by ensuring you are usually so tired you won't become active in the political process? Again, if you don't think this is something they take into account, you're an idiot. They care very much about you being involved in politics.

Snapchat is nothing more than something where I can send goofy pictures to friends. \n\nHowever, posting is a different story. I rarely post on social media, especially through images. Imo, I feel like it is very tolling to post on social media in general. It is easy to get caught up in it in the occasions I post, I catch myself thinking about \"is this aesthetic enough\", \"am I interesting\" or \"what is a good caption\". I don't believe that social media is inherently evil but I feel like there is a dissonance between your actual self and your public image that is the main problem. I am happy with who I am in reality but online me isn't even happy with himself. \n\n\n*\"You lost 20 pounds running this summer for a marathon, good job\"*\n\n\n*\"You can always lose more. You know the camera always adds 10 pounds. Hey, why didn't you take a before pic? You know that girl you think is cute didn't like your pic yet, maybe she just doesn't like you.\"*\n\n\nOnline me is absolutely brutal. And even though I know social media is pointless, I won't lie and say that I do get mesmerized by the likes from people that nonchalantly double tap a screen. It is addicting to have some validation but the worst part is lying to yourself about how cool you are and how you people get caught planning their lives around it.

Here in Guatemala people are poor. Literally \"dirt poor\" - many of those living in poverty literally have dirt floors in their houses. Interestingly, those people are actually too poor to consume much in the way of plastics. They do plenty of damage because they will throw empty packaging in the rivers due to lack of education. But overall they just don't consume as much and are probably not the root of the environmental destruction. \n\nThe lower middle class and middle class, on the other hand...they have just enough money to be able to buy non-necessities like Coca-cola, sugary soft-drinks, packaged candy and so on. Historically education has not been an option for everyone in Guatemala. Throw in a 30-year civil war that only officially ended in 1998, and you'll see that most people of \"grandparent\" age (often the primary caregivers) never went to school at all.  But their children are finally finding employment. The outsources have arrived and set up call centers. Construction is booming. Money is finally flowing into many homes here. Not a lot. But enough. \n\nThey don't have to drink well water at dinner any more. They're splurging on 2 liter bottles of coke, sprite, etc and placing them on the table at every family meal. Hallelujah! They can afford it! Plastic containers make all these products - once deemed as \"luxury items\" for them in the past - affordable. Now you have Wal-Mart coming in to Guatemala City and selling plastic crap even cheaper. Plastic toys for the kids are now affordable too! That wasn't always the case. Primary care givers see nothing wrong with buying more and more plastic shit to put in their homes. Plastic chairs. Plastic sandals. Plastic cups at the dinner table. Plastic cutlery. \n\nBut it's not just consumption. Remember the fact that water isn't potable here. So every time you want to DRINK water, you either have to buy a huge plastic (reusable) jug, or you're just buying regular plastic bottles of water. The reusable jugs are fine for your house, but think about how many times you are at an airport, the gym, university, school...if you live in the first world, you'd use a drinking fountain. Now imagine that drinking fountains and drinking out of the tap doesn't exist. How much plastic water bottles will you be buying per day!?!? Multiply that by 17 million people. \n\nFinally, the government has absolutely zero forethought in how to dispose of these items. You don't see recycle bins on the street or in businesses. Even public trash bins are nowhere to be found. So you've got mass consumption with nowhere to put the trash. There's traditionally no law enforcement either. You can throw a bucket of plastic waste out of a moving vehicle while you're driving in front of a police officer. They won't stop you or even blink an eye. \n\nTL;DR - Lack of education + slight uptick in economic buying power + low education levels in head-of-household members + lethargic government and law enforcement = environmental disaster."}, {"comment_id": "ekgp515", "post_id": "bb6phy", "comment": "Baltimore had a similar problem and introduced a pretty great method for cleaning it up:  \n [https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/](https://www.mrtrashwheel.com/)"}, {"comment_id": "ekgn4y9", "post_id": "bb6phy", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ekgmm5v", "post_id": "bb6phy", "comment": "This hurts my soul."}, {"comment_id": "ekh2p75", "post_id": "bb6phy", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "ekgnjoc", "post_id": "bb6phy", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "ekgnfzf", "post_id": "bb6phy", "comment": "Something like 10 rivers in Asia account for 90% of the plastic polluting the worlds oceans.

The session will begin with a discussion of considerations for effective pedagogy, drawing on research and good practice curated by York University\u2019s Teaching Commons. Participants will then be invited to participate in a semi-structured exercise that guides the development of a GNL-based course activity that is built on a foundation of meaningful learning outcomes, co-facilitated by an international partner, supported by an institutional champion, and scaffolded by effective learning activities, assessment strategies, and learning technologies.

The goals are non-binding. \n\nHow are we going to enforce China, the biggest emitter, to actually do something?  The US has steadily declined in the last several years so our part is being done.  Also, who is going to determine how the funds the US puts in gets spent on actually helping the issue?  We all know that agencies is SO good at spending money correctly. With only 2 countries putting up their fair share in NATO, why would the US expect many of these same countries to foot the bill for this as well? \n\nEDIT:  I have had so many responses and some great conversation.

Big companies wanting more regulation to stop competition from arising. This is surprising?"}, {"comment_id": "diblru3", "post_id": "6emap3", "comment": "Dropping out of the agreement will let the U.S. avoid several deleterious effects of the agreement.\n\n1 - Goodbye to \u2018American Last.\u2019 The Paris agreement was basically an attempt to halt climate change on the honor system. Its only legal requirements were for signatories to announce goals and report progress, with no international enforcement mechanism. As a result, it was likely that the United States and wealthy European nations would have adopted and implemented severe climate change rules while many of the world\u2019s governments would avoid doing anything that would slow their own economies. The agreement basically made the U.S. economy and Europe\u2019s strongest economies sacrificial lambs to the cause of climate change.\n    \n2 - Industrial Carnage. The regulations necessary to implement the Paris agreement would have cost the U.S. industrial sector 1.1 million jobs, according to a study commissioned by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. These job losses would center in cement, iron and steel, and petroleum refining. Industrial output would decline sharply.\n    \n3 - Hollowing Out Michigan, Missouri, Pennsylvania, and Ohio. The industrial carnage would have been concentrated on four states, according to the Chamber of Commerce study. Michigan\u2019s GDP would shrink by 0.8 percent and employment would contract by 74,000 jobs. Missouri\u2019s GDP would shrink by 1 percent. Ohio\u2019s GDP would contract 1.2 percent. Pennsylvania\u2019s GDP would decline by 1.8 percent and the state would lose 140,000 jobs.\n    \n4 - Smashing Small Businesses, Helping Big Business. Big businesses in America strongly backed the Paris climate deal. In fact, the backers of the climate deal reads like a \u201cwho\u2019s who\u201d of big American businesses: Apple, General Electric, Intel, Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Morgan Stanley, General Mills, Walmart, DuPont, Unilever, and Johnson & Johnson. These business giants can more easily cope with costly regulations than their smaller competitors and many would, in fact, find business opportunities from the changes required. But smaller businesses and traditional start-ups would likely be hurt by the increased costs of compliance and rising energy costs.\n    \n5- Making America Poorer Again.  A Heritage Foundation study found that the Paris agreement would have increased the electricity costs of an American family of four by between 13 percent and 20 percent annually. It forecast a loss of income of $20,000 by 2035. In other words, American families would be paying more while making less. \n    \n6 - Much Poorer. The overall effect of the agreement would have been to reduce U.S. GDP by over $2.5 trillion and eliminate 400,000 jobs by 2035, according to Heritage\u2019s study. This would exacerbate problems with government funding and deficits, make Social Security solvency more challenging, and increase reliance on government\u2019s spending to support households.\n\nThe Paris deal was, in short, a disaster for America and a nothing-burger for climate."}, {"comment_id": "dibhedc", "post_id": "6emap3", "comment": "wow apple, fb, and google? i remember when reddit loved to hate those companies. i know you guys havent, but i wonder if the ole googs has actually read the 'agreement' "}, {"comment_id": "dibiajp", "post_id": "6emap3", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "dibmw2k", "post_id": "6emap3", "comment": "If the private sector wants it then why don't they make the changes themselves.

It starts and ends with the structure of the corporation itself. Please keep in mind that this is much more complex, I'm simplifying a lot here.\n\nKeep in mind that however you feel about them personally, CEO's and other executives are just employees given a mandate by their boss (typically the board of directors). Even in corporations where you have a CEO who is a majority shareholder they can face removal if enough of the shareholders band together and take over the BoD.\n\nThe board of directors is in turn elected by shareholders, whose primary concern is maximizing the return on their investment. They elect a board who will prioritize profit, even at the expense of employees or the long term health of the company. Many of these \"shareholders\" are themselves corporations or other companies (hedge funds, investment services, etc.) who have their own mandate from customers to prioritize returns.\n\nAnd this whole structure did not develop in a vacuum, it is a product of a system that allows for greater financing options with risk split between several people. The economies of scale that are available in large corporations are really only possible because of the mitigated risk provided by public financing.\n\nSome of these CEOs definitely don't give a shit, but some of them probably honestly believe what they're saying.  That just isn't the mandate they're being given, so they can either maximize profits or they can be removed by the board. The board can either direct them to maximize profits or be removed by the shareholders. And the shareholders can either direct the board to maximize profits or they can remove board members or take their money elsewhere.\n\ntl;dr it's a much bigger and more complex problem than greedy CEO/corporation bad, employees good"}, {"comment_id": "elc0b1p", "post_id": "bf9kde", "comment": "When he landed and I saw the smile on his face, I realized it is probably impossible to fly in that without smiling."}, {"comment_id": "elbzt13", "post_id": "bf9kde", "comment": "Add some flamethrowers and you got yourself a real life super-villain!"}, {"comment_id": "elc09az", "post_id": "bf9kde", "comment": "they say money doesn't buy happiness, but have you ever seen someone sad flying a jetsuit?"}, {"comment_id": "elc13qz", "post_id": "bf9kde", "comment": "God so many people will die if that every made it to commercial distribution."}, {"comment_id": "elcj9d8", "post_id": "bf9kde", "comment": "Every fall I struggle to clean up all the leaves in my yard.

We need corporate action, not virtue signaling.\u00a0 \n\n&#x200B;\n\nSo how about switching to Nuclear power? 20% of the power in the U.S comes from Nuclear reactors. France gets around 75% of their power from Nuclear reactors. It produces no C02, and one day we may actually be able to do something with the \"waste\". Modern reactor designs are literally incapable of melting down, so they're safe as well. Sadly however government policies are such that building new reactors takes too long and is too expensive. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Massive changes to our national energy grid, a moratorium on new fossil fuel infrastructure\u00a0and a [carbon fee and dividend](http://harvardpolitics.com/united-states/carbon-fee-and-dividend-bipartisan-progress-towards-a-climate-change-solution/) (that steeply ramps up) are just some examples of visionary policies that could make a difference. And right now, the \"[Green New Deal](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/02/07/green-new-deal-what-and-what-does-mean-climate-change/2589524002/),\" support it or not, has encouraged a much needed, long overdue societal conversation about these and other options for averting climate catastrophe. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe \"green new deal\" (What a stupid name) is anti-nuclear, so fuck it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n> Consider the benefits. With five years of concentrated effort, we could\u00a0have a supply of clean, renewable energy that is virtually inexhaustible. We could\u00a0have many fewer deaths from mercury, particulates\u00a0and ozone produced by [burning dirty fossil fuels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5800116/). And, we could\u00a0set a shining example for the rest of the world of how the climate crisis can be solved both equitably and productively. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nConsider the benefits of what? You literally did not propose anything to \"consider the benefits\" of. We can't use 100% wind or solar, because our power grid has no method of storing energy. Most of our energy use is at night, and guess when solar panels produce the most energy? At noon, when it is the least needed. This problem is called the duck curve. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe need more reactors, but we cannot produce 100+ more of them in 5 years, especially not with current laws, so I don't know what the fuck the author of this article is talking about. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**For anyone out there that is unaware..** there was a report that claimed that the top 100 corporations were responsible for 75% of the carbon pollution. This is why Redditors and other social activist, such as this article author, claim that individual action is practically useless in the face of those evil corporations. This report blamed the corporations for literally everything however - from extracting the resources needed, to manufacturing, to what the consumer ended up doing with it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe can and should blame corporations when they have particularly horrible and unnecessary practices to save a dollar, but we cannot blame them for our own consumption, and we cannot blame them when there is literally no viable alternative, such as the case with plastic and oil. Oil isn't just for us to load up in our gas tanks so that we can get from point A to point B faster, it has a lot of uses in other products as well. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nWe are the consumers. We drive demand, and we are the ones that need to push for nuclear energy. 20% of our energy comes from Nuclear power. What if it was 80%? 90%? We can do solar as well - it isn't a zero sum game, but we need nuclear power NOW. Over 20% of our carbon production comes from producing energy, and every time that a reactor goes offline it is replaced with carbon-producing alternatives. We must change this. Stop playing the fucking blame game and do something about it. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n [https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=41&t=6](https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=41&t=6)"}, {"comment_id": "epz3r8i", "post_id": "bwn52t", "comment": "ITT: people not reading or absorbing the title and article.\n\nNothing is challenging your individual duties and actions against climate change."}, {"comment_id": "epys17p", "post_id": "bwn52t", "comment": "That's so wrong.\n\n\nCorporation pollute heavily because we ask them to.

I\u2019m only 31 but even now my one goal in my career is to retire before I\u2019m 55, which I might add is something people scoff at then I tell them, telling me that\u2019s NEVER going to happen. Well screw them, work is not my life, it\u2019s just something I do that allows me to support my family.\n\nI enjoy my job, I really do, but the very idea that spending most of our lives at work is just wrong to me. Am I living in a fantasy world? Maybe, but it\u2019s my fantasy and I\u2019m determined to see it realised."}, {"comment_id": "f1om5po", "post_id": "da6axc", "comment": "Where I work production employees work 20 days in a row before getting one, yes ONE, day off before the next 20 days on. \n\nLuckily, I now work in the office five days and am trying to figure out how to give these people their lives back, without much luck.

Quite frankly, I'm a better person. I've negotiated it into every contact and so far I've never heard any employer who was against it.\n\nI've seen more and more people do it and in our office most people work 3 or 4 days. A mate of mine works 2 days a week because that is all the income he needs to sustain his life style.\n\nThere is another aspect to our as well; my salary is in a top bracket, working 5 days just isn't worth the hassle relatively so instead of more salary, I negotiate less hours. Time is more valuable than money.\n\nEdit; another benefit means one day less of travel time a week. About 1,5-2 hours of travel time gained is another two full days a year. It also means less chance to get sick.\n\nFurthermore, because you're more rested, you're less in need of holiday time. I often do a long weekend trip. Currently, I take holiday time so few and far between that I'm swimming in holiday time, 10 weeks or something.\n\nMy extra day has given me opportunity to contribute to os software, work on my own projects, volunteer to various causes, hang out more with mates.\n\nIt helps me develop myself and grow, making me more valuable to employers.\n\nEdit 2; I work in the Netherlands. I have to say, work culture here is very relaxed and productive at the same time. The relation between employers and employees is much more equal. There is a very quid pro quo attitude compared to other countries. I've been here for a while and I don't think I'll move again.\n\nEdit 3; also; if you've spent your holidays, you can take as many more as you want by \"buying\" them. And there is no short term maximum on sick days, mental or physical. Obviously there are some arrangements in place to guide all these things but it generally works well from what I've seen.\n\nOne thing I think that a lot of progress can be made is a longer paid maternity leave for men in the law. On the other hand, I've seen employers be pretty chill in this. Currently I think women get 2 or 3 months? I think men get a day or two?

I'm not an ableist, eugenicist, suicide advocate or other of the crazies in the anti-human overpopulation debate but if you look at the science through an ecological lens instead of a human-centric (humanist) we see it's harming the planet extremely with all the burden modern humanity societies put on the balance of this planet. I am a socialist and progressive, but I don't think being extremely idealistic is going to do anything to understand the climate crisis. Sure, there is cool eco-responsible tech, design etc. being developed but it rarely gets put to good use so we have to confront the reality that while humanity could do a lot better mitigating and even trying to reverse the environmental damage they have inflicted, whether they actually will is another issue entirely and a much less optimistic one.

"}, {"comment_id": "edjv37n", "post_id": "adqk3p", "comment": "I would like to put in my 2c since it seemed like it reached no one last time. I'm a research assistant in a prominent lab that utilities CRISPR/Cas9 in experiments and we have published many papers in a wide range of journals including Nature.\n\nAgain I need to say that all this talk is fiction until we can solve the problems associated with gene editing and the technology as a whole. Expanding on my previous comment from another post, CRISPR/Cas9 as well as any other form of gene editing technique including Zinc fingers and recombinase tech would need a huge leap in development to be used clinically.\n\nTo expand, the main problem is specificity. Current technology allows for whole genome sequencing, which you can check my comment history for context. In short, whole genome sequencing is expensive and since science funding has seemed to decline in recent years (See Spain and see how the scientists are struggling over there), it makes it very inefficient to screen possible gene edits within the whole genome. This, coupled with needing an extreme computer with high processing power to actually process the data is not feasible.\n\nIn addition to the previous problem, another problem is time. How long it takes to produce one cell line with a \"knocked out protein\" (a knock out is a cell line that has a disruption in the DNA that prevents one or more proteins from being produced (For cell lines that have more than one protein knocked out, its usually done in succession)). It can be as fast as one and a half months, and it can also be as slow as 3-4 months or even never! Some genes are fickle like that and are impossible to disrupt.\n\nPeople talking about the possibility of editing a live human or a baby are completely out of their mind and are not educated on the topic. For reference, I would introduce CRISPR/Cas9 to approximately 50,000-125,000 individual cells. This number then gets cut down using various methods which include but are not limited to; applying an antibiotic that would kill the cell if it does not have the CRISPR/Cas9 within the cell and/or using Flow Cytometry such as a FACS sort. This cuts down the number into blocks of 96. This is due to the 96 wells present in a 96 well plate lol. ONE SINGULAR CELL is placed in each of the wells. And from this you can get a hit rate of about 10-30 cell lines (Cells that grew from one cell are called a cell line) that grow which takes about 2 to 3 weeks. Those that grow, you then screen for DNA disruption. You can do this via western blotting or sequencing the DNA (which would be a region of about 1000 bases from the available 3 BILLION BASES). Now if none of the cells that grew are positive for what you want, you start again. As you can imagine, going from 125,000 to 1 cell takes a lot of work just for one positive result. This is amplified for a multi-knockout cell line as you would have to do each step for each protein you want disrupted. And people still want to perform CRISPR/Cas9 experiments on humans even with a huge chance of it not working.\n\nAs you can see I haven't even talked about possibility of introducing another piece of DNA to do the proper \"Editing\" bit of gene editing. This is a whole different ball park and a whole different game that you play after achieving the previous step. This process is possible due to the repair system in the cell that \"protects\" the DNA from mutations. This process is also leads into cell arrest but that's besides the point. So the two types are called Homology directed repair (HDR) and Non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). In conventional circumstances, NHEJ is the method used by the cell. It is also utter crap that doesn't work 99% of the time LOL. This is good because NHEJ actually allows for the production of knock-outs since when we cut the DNA, it is this repair system that is used to repair that strand of DNA. HDR is utilised by scientists (I think? This is due to my lab utilising a different technology to \"rescue\" the cells back to health). This technique introduces a strand of DNA (which in gene editing would be the one that we construct and what we want it to be) and uses this strand of DNA to fix the DNA break that we introduced. This is much more effective than NHEJ. Think of NHEJ like a broken jigsaw puzzle and you're slamming pieces together even if they don't fit. NHEJ basically grabs whatever it can and hopes for the best.\n\nIt is for these reasons that I believe that this would never happen in our life time commercially. I do think it has a lot of potential for clinical trials though, but only in due time and technological advances.  \n\n\n  \nEdit: Fixed some grammer and some other mistakes"}, {"comment_id": "edjqbt7", "post_id": "adqk3p", "comment": "I have Chronic Asthma, I suffer daily and no treatment so far has helped. \n\nWhy would I not want this disease edited out if the technology was perfected and there were no health consequences.\n\n&#x200B;"}, {"comment_id": "edjnzc8", "post_id": "adqk3p", "comment": "Is it fair to propose that today's fears of gene editing will be considered comparable to modern times anti-vaxxer movements to future generations in hindsight?

Same with Basketball players.  (heck, we're already there with China's selective breeding programs!)   Team owners will pay big for great players. \n\nCentralized choices:  Once parents can edit their baby, most will select genes that they know are generally successful.  Tall, yes.  Blonde, probably.  Blue Eyes, Ok.  Big boobs, maybe.   While the selection of successful genes is up for debate, what isn't is the unsuccessful.  Guys like Danny Devito will no longer exist in a world where babies are designed.  Heck, they made a movie about this (Twins).  BTW, as an example look at South Korea.  Plastic surgery there is so commonplace and the preferred face is so omnipresent that the facial recognition software fails repeatedly on devices in South Korea.  \n\nToys:  Let's not forget the ultra wealthy.  Don't think for a second that mom and dad won't breed little Johnny's wife for him.  The perfect mate.  (they practically do now! Cotillion, anyone?)   And let's say Johnny is a forward thinker and decides he'll want some play toys when he's 40.  So, he buys 4-5 embryos, and has them tweak for purely physical appearances, ready to be play toys when Johnny is ready for some vacation after a hard 20 years of running the markets.  \n\nThe implications are NUTS.  But it's gonna happen.  Sure, there are hurdles, but the incentive, the MONEY is too big to ignore.

It's because we have no right to make assumptions about an *individual* based on *group* data. We have empathy and can feel how much it would suck to be treated differently just because you look different. \n\nOver the decades we've somehow deluded ourselves into believing that the reason we treat everyone the same, is because we actually are the same. It must be the most serendipitous miracle in the world that blood pressure, bone density, genetic muscle mass, liver size and every other aspect of the body are different across genetic clusters, yet the most sensitive subjects like penis size and brain function just happen to have exactly the same mean, median and variance. The real reason we treat everyone the same, is that discrimination is wrong in and of itself. In a civilized society, we judge people as individuals, not by their stereotypes. *Regardless of whether those stereotypes are true,* there will be plenty of exceptions and everyone should be given the opportunity to prove themselves. \n\nBy the way, there will always be \"inequality\" in a fair meritocracy. We test people's intelligence with tests and interviews and some genetically lucky subset of the population does a lot better than others. They then get better jobs and more money. I don't see how genetic altering could change that for the worse. Like, \"Oh no, we're going to fairly pay the smartest people more money than the dumbest people\" -- oh wait that already happens. In fact, if the reason we get displaced from jobs in the future is that the average human has become smarter than us, then that might be a bit bad for us, but it's great news for humanity and technological progress.

"}, {"comment_id": "duyq42b", "post_id": "80v16m", "comment": "I rarely post in those threads because there is so much hostility going around. My 'problem' with GMO food isn't because it is creating \"cancer\" or is \"unnatural\" or all the other things one side is accusing the other side of believing. \n\nMy problem with GMO food are political and economical reasons (and ecological ones but different than what you might think) and there are many of them. There are points like monopolies, power over the seed market, intellectual properties, excessive use of pesticides, creating resistances in germs and pests, loss of biodiversity, ineffectiveness use of resources (yes, read that right), etc.\n\nI'll take one example. There is the claim that we need GMO food to defeat world hunger. But it doesn't matter how \"effective\" GMO food is. World hunger doesn't exist because we aren't able to create enough food, there is already more than enough food created every day to feed even more people. Famines arise especially in places that are struck by (civil) war, terror, forced displacement. People aren't able to care for their fields anymore so there will be hunger. This is also one of the reasons why the FAO or aid agencies know that there _will_ be a famine many months in the future. Because the food that isn't sowed today won't be harvested in half a year. \n\nNone of this is in any way influenced by GMOs. GMO companies also aren't charitable organisations, they are companies and therefore want to make profit. It's important to critically assess how helpful each product actually is and what's just \"advertising\". \n\nAnother point is that a high amount of food never ends up on a plate or only in a very inefficient way. It ends up as biofuel or as fodder. The first one means a total waste of important resources (land, water, fuel, electricity, pesticides, fertilizers, etc.), the second one is a partial waste. Growing meat is a very inefficient way to create food. GMO food doesn't alleviate this problem, it enforces it. A large percentage of GMO food already gets grown to create those two. Our current way of agriculture is very inefficient and GMO food will contribute to this problem. \n\nNext point, food waste. Around [50% of food created in the US gets thrown away.](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2016/jul/13/us-food-waste-ugly-fruit-vegetables-perfect) That's not just calories you throw away, it's also many other resources I mentioned above like fuel. GMO food changes exactly nothing about it, it's like putting more gasoline in a leaky tank hoping to alleviate the situation while creating more problems. Food waste isn't just a first world problem, many third world countries also suffer from it yet for different reasons. They lack proper tools to store, transport and cool food to prevent it from rotting. It's possible to \"create\" a lot of food here simply by preventing it from spoiling. \n\nNext point, loss of diversity. Currently there's an extinction wave of many old and often highly specialized livestock breeds and plant cultivars. This is highly valuable DNA that gets lost forever. Those breeds/cultivars may not excel as much in mass or dislike some conditions of our current way of agriculture. But they offer very valuable other traits like resistances against droughts, floodings, salty water, germs, etc. Those aspects become more and more important in times of global warming. Loss of diversity is a very important problem that the FAO is trying to deal with at the moment. A low amount of used breeds/cultivars can lead to critical situations like we currently can see at the [banana crisis](http://money.cnn.com/2016/04/19/news/bananas-banana-crisis-disease/index.html) where one disease is decimating one of the most popular banana sorts on a global scale. \n\nLast point, some \"hopes\" into GMO food helping to fight malnutrition and hunger weren't fulfilled. One prominent example for this was the \"Golden Rice\" which was supposed to help against vitamin A deficiency. Research has been going on formore than two decades which is a very long time for organisations aiming to help ill and starving people. There _still_ isn't a finished, usable seed. There are also doubts about if the concept of rice supplying vitamin A works at all. There are plenty of critical voices about this project that don't come from environmental protection organisations or organisations that aren't critical to GMOs. Just picking [one article out of many.](https://source.wustl.edu/2016/06/genetically-modified-golden-rice-falls-short-lifesaving-promises/)\n\n>\u201cThe rice simply has not been successful in test plots of the rice breeding institutes in the Philippines, where the leading research is being done,\u201d Stone said. \u201cIt has not even been submitted for approval to the regulatory agency, the Philippine Bureau of Plant Industry (BPI).\u201d\n\n>\u201cA few months ago, the Philippine Supreme Court did issue a temporary suspension of GMO crop trials,\u201d Stone said. \u201cDepending on how long it lasts, the suspension could definitely impact GMO crop development. But it\u2019s hard to blame the lack of success with Golden Rice on this recent action.\u201d\n\n>As Stone and Glover note in the article, researchers continue to have problems developing beta carotene-enriched strains that yield as well as non-GMO strains already being grown by farmers.\n\n>Researchers in Bangladesh also are in the early stages of confined field trials of Golden Rice, but it is doubtful that these efforts will progress any quicker than in the Philippines.\n\n>Even if genetic modification succeeds in creating a strain of rice productive enough for poor farmers to grow successfully, it\u2019s unclear how much impact the rice will have on children\u2019s health.\n\n>As Stone and Glover point out, it is still unknown if the beta carotene in Golden Rice can even be converted to Vitamin A in the bodies of badly undernourished children. There also has been little research on how well the beta carotene in Golden Rice will hold up when stored for long periods between harvest seasons, or when cooked using traditional methods common in remote rural locations, they argue.\n\n>Meanwhile, as the development of Golden Rice creeps along, the Philippines has managed to slash the incidence of Vitamin A deficiency by non-GMO methods, Stone said.\n\nIt's important to see GMO food critically as well and question its actual effectiveness. \n\n\nThose are some of my problems with GMO food. And don't bother throwing copypastas with links about \"gmo doesn't create cancer\" at me again, that absolutely wasn't my point.\n\nEdit: Fixed some words."}, {"comment_id": "duym7s1", "post_id": "80v16m", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "duymk19", "post_id": "80v16m", "comment": "Coming from someone who use to fear this, the problem is that the knowledge is not well spread and the ability to explain such conclusions to the average person is very poor. \n\nThe rise of Evidence Based Practitioners have helped, but it comes down to people having an issue with trust. \n\n(1) Mom's are more likely to trust Public Forums where they never met the person - over their doctor. \n\n(2) People who little knowledge on a certain topic, are REALLY bad at knowing whose right between two sides of a debate (even when one is a clear cut expert, and the other is just a profound author).

Instead of safety, people should be worried about letting one corporation become the one that sells the majority of seeds for all farmers.

It's pretty prestigious to solve world hunger, you also don't need to be a visionary genius to develop GMOs at this point, it's fairly mundane. Then there needs to be regulation so that people don't create resistances in other plants by continuously spraying with just one pesticide. That's also politically challenging in the ever deregulating USA. The worst thing that can happen, and there seems to be little to stop it at the moment, is that one company is allowed to become so huge it will take a year or more to mount any significant competition to it, and farmers are forced to buy the seeds from them because of patents/copyright protection.

The only people who won't starve are people like the idiot big name Hollywood actors who have enough money to still buy the cottage organic food that they think is the solution to everything. I think it's pretty fucking immoral at this point not to go forward with GMO solutions for world hunger. And while there's not much reason to be concerned about the safety of GMO itself (beyond it actually being what it says it is in the tin, easy enough to do spot checks), we should be very concerned with how it is implemented.

I've had a credit on my credit card for the past two years. Am I earning interest on it? No. Instead, once a year, my credit card company does its best to ensure that my card balance goes back into the red by issuing me a cheque that never gets cashed.The money that doesn't get deposited in my bank then rolls back into my credit account and shows as a credit for the next year. So the net effect is that nothing has happened and my credit card still shows a balance (it's meagre, like a couple of bucks). How is this symmetrical with what the credit card company charges me if I go into debt? The two instances are not identical, but I feel there is overlap here. \n\nI have spent a long time trying to do my best to ensure that these bastards who farm and harvest user data do not get a hold of mine. There really is only so much you can do to stop them invading your private lives and treating you like a product, yourself. \n\nMake no mistake, you ARE being treated like a product - they are stamping you, profiling you, numbering you, analysing you, demographically sectoring you, filtering you with a set of others like you and then charging other companies for access to you.

In some ways, it's almost like trying to get a copy of the data the government holds about you, only the government says it's for safety instead of marketing. \n\nIn the UK, there was a huge stink when the NHS blithely handed over a craptonne of data to Google in order for them to perfect their AI diagnosis kit.

The reason salaries exist is that jobs sometimes do not make sense to exist in a 9 to 5 capacity. Thus, salary is often paid more and compensated well, but with an expectation you are going to get your shit done you need to get done.\n\nIn my job the LAST thing I want to be doing is emailing at critical day-time hours when I am working with clients, having face to face meetings, training new employees and so on.

They are important, so often once I unwind at home I'll sit on my laptop for a bit doing a bunch of followup work, or I hit it up in the morning after the gym, before I head out to work. I don't feel like my company is abusing me in this regard. In fact, I absolutely could do them during the day. But, I would accomplish less and be less productive. I didn't get to be a Regional Director, next stop VP, in my 27 billion dollar company by worrying about how I should be compensated for emailing people outside the 40hr work week.\n\nThe reality is that my company is one way where this doesn't make sense, imo. For other companies, it makes sense. I get it though... there's always some companies that abuse the lower tier employees so the government is trying to regulate that. They already do a good job with overtime hours for people forced to stay in the office but are on salary. This has actually somewhat self-regulated in a way though because many of those types of salary jobs were engineering, software development and so on, and they were being abused into overtime... but with so much competition now, it's so simple to jump to another development job that companies were forced to either pay substantially for overtime, or to get rid of the overtime culture in their company... Funny enough, the worst abusers of this are all the silicon valley \"startups\" that expect you to give your soul to this company without revenue yet, only an idea.\n\nAnyway, I get *why* they are trying to do this, I am only saying that from the standpoint of salary, and the standpoint of writing up job offer contracts, they are just going to be explicit in the salary contracts that emailing off hours is a part of the job description, though in reality, any top person that you actually want in your company is already going to know this.\n\nBut ya, any company that expects an hourly wage person to be doing outside emails, Fuck them.

I just don't want the government to have total control of what type of technology can or can't be developed.\n\nI don't want them regulating the possibilities of AI or any technology at all. One of their aims is to prevent technology, especially in terms of automation, from \"ruining lives\". I can imagine this pertains to human jobs being replaced by AI that can do the same or better job. BUT how do they exactly determine which is the \"dangerous\" or \"disruptive\" AI? Let's take for instance music that is created by AI. I believe in the past, there's already been an experiment like that and the AI was able to create a song by using music theory and also by analyzing how a bunch of songs were composed or written. How can they tell whether this will hurt actual human artists? Just because an AI can create a song by itself doesn't mean it's going to be a song that everybody likes. Art is subjective, so even if the AI tries to follow the \"formula\" for creating a hit song, it might actually end up with a flop because of sounding \"too generic\" or simply not having the human element, such as a charismatic human performer. What about in game development? There are software used for generating terrain models or structures that appear in games. Do these take away jobs from actual digital artists? Anybody can use this type of software and just a few clicks would produce a pretty realistic or beautiful looking scenery. \n\nWhat about AI when it comes to vehicles and equipment choosing which person to kill in case of an unavoidable accident, something that future automated cars will have to deal with? Should the government dictate how the car's AI should function? What if the government says \"Vehicle AI should ALWAYS save the child or other pedestrians and allow the driver to die.\"? I don't like that personally. I believe this kind of \"moral\" choice should be made by the car's owner. If I owned an AI powered car, then I should have the freedom to choose \"Kill Pedestrians, Save Me!\".\n\nWhat about robots? I'm sure they already don't want Terminator style robots running around, killing people. STILL, even now there are lots of hobbyists who have made toy robots that can be weaponized anytime. They might look like harmless little toy robots armed with hammers and nerf guns to crush or flip the opposition, but change their little toy weapons into real ones and you've got some nice killer robots that can either function on their own or be controlled remotely. \n\nAnyway, I really don't like the idea of the government being some kind of guide... or \"moral guide\" when it comes to technology. The reason for this is that the government's \"morality\" will always reflect what those in power believe. What if the government got run by some easily offended people and then they say \"Video games shouldn't have realistic blood or breast physics because these promote violence and misogyny, and satanism, make those illegal!\"? What if they force software developers to put auto-censorship on nude pics, dick pics, boobie pics? What if they enacted a law where you cannot use fake names on the internet when signing up for any type of service, in order to prevent terrorism (what does that even have to do with this)? What if clicking \"Yes, I am 18, Let Me In!\" to an adult site as a minor would cause the AI planted in the website to call Child Protective Services to your home to arrest the adults for not monitoring you enough?\n\nOne recent technology that I'm sure is a tasty subject for them is the DeepFake tech. That's the one where you find a video that you like (typically a sexy video), then you find a video of someone you like to replace the actors in the sexy video. You allow the software to analyze both the sexy video and the video that has the person you like (frame by frame!) and it creates a way to transfer the face of the person you like to one of the actors in the sexy video. Personally, I think this is a great, innovative technology. Just imagine the type of logic that must have gone into the development of this software, and the fact that it works so well is astounding! Humans, being the horny species that we are, of course used this tech for pornographic fun, and that's why it has such a bad reputation among some people. BUT think of the other applications it has! It doesn't have to be something that \"saves humanity\" or \"contributes to the development of mankind\", but just think about the entertainment value! Have you seen the video where this old Family Sitcom got deepfaked and all the characters got replaced by Mike Tyson? It was hilarious! Just because it started with porn doesn't mean it ends with porn. The same goes with every tech in the world. We have knives to slice and cut meat to help us cook, but some crazy people use knives to stab or chop up people. Just imagine if simply the technology of deepfake became illegal, then that means even the more \"family friendly\" applications of this software also would cease to exist. It doesn't matter whether we create something for good or bad, people will always find ways to use it in their own special way.\n\nFor the Department of Technology, I don't want them to have full power on what type of software or AI can or can't be developed. I just want them to function as a more knowledgeable branch of the government that would be able to handle cases like Personal Information being sold by Facebook and others, more competently. It has to be one that is populated by experienced, and definitely proven members of the computer and science fields who have better ideas of how things work and what can be done to prevent abuse of people while NOT affecting the freedom of individuals to develop whatever technology they want.\n\nIn the end, at least simply speaking for myself, the Department of Technology should only help people when they're being victimized by things related to science and technology, such as those never ending ransomeware, international scammers that are using more and more sophisticated ways of scamming people via technology, shady websites that steal people's information to sell to the black market, and things like that. They shouldn't really meddle with the technology people begin to create. The beginning of something innovative might actually start as something scary at first. Just imagine if the first people to discover fire got hurt because it was hot, so they believed that all fires are demons and should not be started at all.

What happens when they are surplussed and every other PMC is buying them and using them to suppress local governments in less developed regions?\n\nAlso, they have no control in what ways this tech is going to be used after it is sold. Even Kalashinikov ended up regretting the use his rifle was given [1]. Imagining this happening to you, but without you even knowing that you were developing military tech in the first place.\n\nAlso, people are comparing potential battlefield enhancing tech with MS Office. Come on, how can thocompared similarlyse products even be compared? Do people honestly believe everything the military use should be on the same level? This tech could directly enable someone to kill.\n\nAnd I know this will probably upset a lot of people, but the US has a long history of using it's power on other nations, as I can personally attest as I live in a country that had a dictatorship installed by the CIA [2]. Microsoft is an international company with workers from around the globe, some of which came from countries with similar histories than mine. Try looking through those lenses and thinking how would you feel if your work was being used by that same institutions that created those cues.\n\nI just hope I shed some light in some of the reasons that probably made those workers upset.

Using generative adversarial networks, users of the software are with just a few clicks able to sketch images that are nearly photorealistic. The software will instantly turn a couple of lines into a gorgeous mountaintop sunset. This is MS Paint for the AI age.\n\n> Called GauGAN, the software is just a demonstration of what\u2019s possible with Nvidia\u2019s neural network platforms. It\u2019s designed to compile an image how a human would paint, with the goal being to take a sketch and turn it into a photorealistic photo in seconds. In an early demo, it seems to work as advertised.\n\n> In order to have real-time results, GauGAN has to run on a Tensor computing platform. Nvidia demonstrated this software on an RDX Titan GPU platform, which allowed it to produce results in real time. The operator of the demo was able to draw a line and the software instantly produced results. However, Bryan Catanzaro, VP of Applied Deep Learning Research, stated that with some modifications, GauGAN can run on nearly any platform, including CPUs, though the results might take a few seconds to display.\n\n> In the future game developers may no longer need to design their own graphics but may incorporate such technologies.\n\n> Source: https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2019/03/18/gaugan-photorealistic-landscapes-nvidia-research/\n\nThanks everyone!

Cells were imaged for over 6 hours at a frequency of 1 image every 20 seconds\n\nSpecifically, the cancer cell line is MC38-OVA, a transduced colon cancer cell line that expresses the ovalbumin (OVA) model antigen.\n\nThe T-cells, come from OT-I mice, carry a transgenic T-cell receptor responsive to OVA residues 257-264 (SIINFEKL peptide) in the context of the MHC I H2kb.\n\nIn this experiment, the T-cells that were activated in the first experiment and that are now called \u201ceffectors\u201d, are incubated with MC38-OVA cancer cells. Upon recognition of their target (the OVA residues on the MHC I H2kB of the cancer cells), T-cells induce the killing of the cancer cells.\n\n**Why is this a major frontier in medicine?**\n\nSo this is a mouse system, and a widely used research tool.\n\nIt is a major frontier, because the past few years have seen a major resurgence in interest in reprogramming T-cells to kill cancer cells. Most success has been seen with CAR-T cells, genetically modifying the T-cells to essentially express an antibody/TCR hybrid that lets them hunt down and kill cancer cells positive for the antibody target. This has worked great for blood cancer (two FDA approved drugs; more on the way). But it has struggled for solid tumors. And it only really works well for proteins that are expressed on the outside of the tumor cell. Some of the most 'tumor specific' proteins are intra-cellular.\n\nThat's where transgenic TCR technology comes in. TCRs represent a way of targeting intracellular peptides through TCR-pMHC interactions. So tumor-specific, intracellular proteins can be recognized by T-cells if you design the right TCR. We are already seeing the first hints that this might actually work in the clinic. Last December, Gilead [reported promising early results targeting HPV-associated peptides in HPV+ tumors](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DtdNjkEWsAUAzEI.jpg).\n\nOne of the big challenges in designing these synthetic T-cell receptors is being pretty damned sure that the molecule you come up with is specific for the tumor cell. [In an early trial, for example](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3581823/) the TCR was not sufficiently specific, ended up targeting the patients' central nervous system and killed two out of three patients. This is the stuff that scares the crap out of researchers.\n\nI generally think we've gotten a lot better at understanding how to model/predict specificity. But stuff like that trial remain an overhang, really pushing researchers to be as sure as possible.\n\nExciting to see what comes next!\n\n___\n\nEdit: PS - this is a crosspost from r/sciences, a sub I started recently for sharing cool science in ways not allowed on some of the major science subs.

It's not yet a perfect system and there are still many issues with it. And since there seems to be a whole lot of misinformation going around in this comments section regarding CRISPR, let me try and clear the air.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9 works by pairing Cas9 (think of this as a protein that acts like a scissor that cuts double-stranded DNA) with a guide-RNA that directs the Cas9 to the gene of interest. Once at the site of interest, Cas9 then cuts the double-stranded DNA and the host cell will then try to repair it and occasionally, it does a poor job of repairing the break and we end up with what is known as an indel (insertion-deletion) or frameshift mutation. Either one of these mutations can result in either:\n\n(a) that piece of DNA no longer being able to code for the functioning protein; or\n(b) coding for a protein that is misshapen in some form and not able to carry out its function. \n\nThis is the basic principle of the technology and is why it holds so much promise. Using CRISPR, we could potentially knockout \"bad\" genes that lie at the root cause of so many diseases. However, you NEED to realize that the guide RNA is something that is constructed in a lab, based on our knowledge of the human genome. the guide RNA needs to match precisely with what we are trying to target in order for Cas9 to do it's thing ([Here's a link to a video made by the Brain Institute at MIT that explains the system](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pp17E4E-O8)). However, this is by no means perfect. Very often, we get \"off-target\" effects i.e. the guide RNA finds another site (because biology is complicated like that) and causes cas9 to cut at an unintended site. For the lack of better words, this can really fuck shit up if the cut happens on a gene that is actually important for routine functions in the body. While scientists are working really hard to figure out how to eliminate this and make things really precise, we don't yet have a real solution and because of that, we are quite a ways away from actually putting this into patients.\n\nSo in summary, while it has potential, CRISPR is not some magic cure for all of humanity's diseases. We still need to work out kinks and figure out how to eliminate off-target effects.\n\nIt's far from a perfect system and there is still years of research to be done in the field. As a scientist, I feel like it's my civic duty to inform the public to simmer down.

Especially that fucking ever popular Kurzgesagt video, which starts off reasonable and delves into a creative writing exercise. Genetic engineering has existed for a long time; CRISPR just makes it much easier, simpler, and faster. \n\nThe linked article is decent, although the title makes it sound as though they're targeting cancer to kill it in the same way CRISPR \"killed\" HIV in the experiment. If you actually read the body of the article, there's more of a focus on using a Cas13a-adapted system to *detect* cancer (which has been done for detection of Zika and HIV previously). \n\nIt then concludes by asking us to imagine a world in which Angelina Jolie could've \"taken a dose of genes that snip away the BRCA2 genes that threatened her with cancer\". Right, but this is in no way parallel to what the researchers did with regards to HIV in mice. You can't just \"snip away\" the mutant BRCA2; you need to replace it with a functional, non-mutated BRCA2, which adds a whole extra layer of difficulty.\n\nThe closest thing to a \"cure\" that I can see coming - that doesn't involve anything embryonic - would be in HIV. Viral genome means you target with limited off-target effects, target conserved sequences to avoid adaptation, and reduce viral load leading to a reduction in symptoms. \n\nHowever, CRISPR is poorly suited to cancer therapeutics for many reasons. The efficiency of CRISPR editing is very, very low, often single-digits low. If you have a pool of cancer cells and only 5% have the mutant Gene A repaired, who cares? The remaining 95% are going to continue on their merry metastatic way. You need a way to target the cells you want to hit - easy if you're targeting HIV, because only a certain subset have the HIV genome in their DNA, but how are you doing it in cancer? And importantly, cancer very rarely presents with a single faulty gene. Cancer is driven by the accumulation of many mutations and genetic dysregulations - fixing one or a couple is unlikely to reverse the cell's fate.\n\nCRISPR is a fantastic tool in molecular bio labs and the biosensor applications hold a lot of promise. Therapeutics - especially as they're described in the media - are a long way off. The immuno/CRISPR combo stuff could yield something interesting though. Please, be excited about science!

CRISPRs are pieces of DNA that can be made to target a certain sequence in your genome. The first step is to find where in the genome you want the CRISPRs to land. Once you know, you find out what the genetic sequence of that specific area is and you design your CRISPRs to have a sequence that compliments it. These are CRISPR 'guides', and you'll hear them called 'gRNAs'. The guide will land on your target. But it doesn't do anything to the genome, it's just a guide. If you look at the structure of CRISPRs, you'll see there's the 'guide' portion, but also a hairpin-like loopy structure, and that's more or less the same for any CRISPR - the only thing that changes is the guide.\n\nWhen the guide lands on the target you picked on the genome, it just sits there. What happens is the CRISPRs are put into a cell with a protein called Cas9, which is why you see publications refer to it as 'CRISPR/Cas9'. The Cas9, with the help of the hairpine-like loopy part of the CRISPRs, will make cuts in certain areas around the CRISPR guide. We know more or less where Cas9 will make the cuts, so we design the CRISPR guides with that in mind, and that gives us the power of precision. After the cuts are made, there are two possibilities. One possibility is the body's natural mechanism will 'fill' the cuts that Cas9 made with random genetic material (nucleotides) or just leave it empty. This is a random process and you don't know what you're going to get; this is fine because sometimes you just want to add or remove some space, because that changes the way the gene is 'read', which can cure some genetic diseases. The other possibility is that you add a 'template' that is designed in such a way that when Cas9 makes that cut, the body will see the template fits perfectly, and it will 'sow' it in where the cuts. Using this method, you can add or remove entire genes, or you can make very specific corrections to one.\n\nSo, this sounds great and simple, so why is it not? Can't you use the template method to just change genes to make designer babies or cure any genetic disease? Not really, and this is where it gets really tricky.\n\nFirst, the CRISPR/Cas9 system isn't nearly specific enough to do crazy things with. Researchers in China about a year and a half ago tried using it on a non-viable human embryo, and they found that it was even less specific than in test tubes. The genome is vast, and your CRISPR guides WILL attach to somewhere they're not supposed to. There are some ways we're trying to fix that, including making new Cas9 protein variants to make it more specific. But it's still not nearly specific enough. Another interesting thing about CRISPR guides is their length. They're usually around 20 base pairs long. You'd think the longer they are, the more specific, but that's not entirely true. Depending on your target and the Cas9 protein, a shorter guide can be more specific. In the research I do, 16-17 basepairs is A LOT more specific than 20; I almost can't use 20 because it's so much worse.\n\nSecond, how do you deliver it to a real human? Well, one of the things they mentioned in the article are inactive viruses (they use an AAV as an example). There are many, many types of inactive viruses you use, and they're used because you can pack more inside of them. That's important because you need to pack in both CRISPR guides and the Cas9 protein. But wait... what about this template? Well, good question. Ideally, the CRISPR guides, Cas9 protein and template would all go in one virus package, but we can't really make the viruses carriers hold that much in any meaningful way. Also, certain viruses have advantages over others. Some are more specific than others but harder to make. Some express certain Cas9 variants better than others. Some have a high yield, others don't.\n\nIn fact, the chase right now isn't even CRISPR/Cas9, it's the viruses used to hold them. Our goal right now is to make them easier to make, be more efficient and specific, and safer for humans so that they can be used for treatment. Fun fact: Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle is where a lot of the viruses used in these gene editing research are made. In the Thomas building, they have a team that makes carrier viruses on-demand for their own and other groups' research. They're doing a GREAT job!\n\nThe article specifically mentions UC Berkely, but they're not the first or the only, and definitely not the most advanced. For example, the lab of Hans-Peter Kiem at Fred Hutch (https://research.fhcrc.org/kiem/en.html) has been doing this for a long time, and also does work with two similar methods to CRISPR/Cas9 called TALENs and Zinc Fingers, which work in more or less the same way but are more complex. They're a big focus right now because they're easier to get into stem cells and safer for use in humans! They do a lot of work with HIV, and have been working on this HIV 'kill switch' for a while now. Still not there, but making progress. And there are many others labs like it!\n\nI don't work with HIV, I'm more of a rare genetic diseases type of gal. But I do know CRISPR, TALENs and Zinc Fingers are many, many years away from eradicating HIV or cancer. The good news is WE ARE MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS VERY QUICKLY! Tho the idea of designer babies is still just an idea. Our ability to specifically target certain areas is still nowhere near 100%."}, {"comment_id": "dhx5phx", "post_id": "6cral1", "comment": "I'm a scientist and reading all these comments makes me think the title is stupid."}, {"comment_id": "dhx7fku", "post_id": "6cral1", "comment": "Um, no.

I wish people would stop sucking Bill Gates dick. \n\nBill Gates was a ruthless, cutthroat businessman who made his vast wealth by using every dirty trick in the book (and inventing a few new dirty tricks along the way) and then using Microsoft's success to effectively hold the computer industry hostage for 20 years. He viewed any successful non-Microsoft software as a threat, even if that software was for Windows. And if that software was cross-platform he viewed it as an existential threat, since it lessened people's dependence on Microsoft.\n\nInternet Explorer? Microsoft didn't make it. They completely missed the boat on the World Wide Web, and with the popularity of the Netscape Navigator web browser (which was available on almost every computer, from $20k SGI workstations to Macs to Windows PCs), Bill Gates & co saw a threat to Microsoft's dominance, so they rushed to get their own web browser by buying one from a company called Spyglass Software. Now, since Netscape Navigator cost money, everyone assumed Microsoft would charge for Internet Explorer, and Microsoft's contract with Spyglass Software promised to give Spyglass a cut of whatever money they made from Internet Explorer sales. So what did Microsoft do? They released Internet Explorer for free, which was something none of their competitors could do since Microsoft had such deep pockets. Spyglass Software was ruined, and so was Netscape eventually. Once Internet Explorer was available, Microsoft threatened not to sell Windows to any PC manufacturer that bundled Netscape Navigator, which would later get them in trouble with the Department of Justice and the EU.\n\nDirectX? Began life as an OpenGL knock-off that would (Microsoft hoped) lock-in developers to Windows. Hell, Microsoft was so afraid of OpenGL (since it was cross platform and the industry standard at the time) that they offered to partner with SGI (creator of OpenGL) on a new, cross platform graphics library called FireGL. Except that Microsoft had no intention of actually releasing FireGL. They hoped working on FireGL would distract SGI from advancing OpenGL long enough to let DirectX (then called Direct3D) catch up to it, and when their plan worked Microsoft just up and abandoned FireGL.\n\nWhen 3D accelerators were new (which are now called GPUs), there was a much larger number of companies developing desktop GPUs than the nVidia/AMD/Intel tri-opoly we have today, and many of them were too small to afford to create their own full OpenGL implementations. Since most PC GPUs at the time only implemented a small subset of OpenGL in hardware, Microsoft wrote a full software OpenGL implementation and then offered it to GPU companies, so those companies could just replace the parts that their GPU implemented in hardware and still have a full OpenGL driver. Once they had all spent a good deal of time doing this, Microsoft actually refused to license any of their OpenGL code for release, effectively guaranteeing that smaller GPU companies would only have support for DirectX.\n\nVideo For Windows? VFW (now called Windows Media or whatever) only came into being because Microsoft literally stole the source code to QuickTime For Windows. Both Microsoft and Intel were having a hard time getting video to play smoothly on PCs, when Apple surprised them both by releasing QuickTime For Windows, a port of their QuickTime video framework for Macintosh. QuickTime For Windows could to smooth video playback on ordinary PCs with no special hardware, and Microsoft and Intel were caught completely off guard by it. Apple had contracted out to a 3rd party company to do the Windows port of QuickTime, so what did MS do? They went to the same company and gave them a ton of money to develop Video For Windows, but an insanely short schedule, knowing full well that the company would essentially have to re-use a lot of the QuickTime For Windows source code to get the project done on time.\n\nWhen Apple found out (their contract with the other company stated that Apple owned all the QuickTime For Windows source code), they went ballistic and sued Microsoft. Microsoft had been caught red-handed and knew that Apple had them by the balls. So MS settled. Remember when Microsoft \"bailed out\" Apple in the 90s by buying $150 million in Apple stock? Despite what the tech press reported, that's not what actually happened. The $150 million in non-voting Apple stock that Microsoft bought was part of their settlement (Apple was no longer on the verge of bankruptcy by that point, and didn't need to be bailed out). The settlement also had Microsoft agreeing to port MS Office and Internet Explorer to Macintosh.\n\nSo a lot of people my age tend to view Bill Gates' recent charities as an attempt to whitewash his reputation and, in a way, buy his way into heaven.\n\nEmbrace, extend and extinguish ~Microsoft"}, {"comment_id": "ddv2u3t", "post_id": "5ulrgf", "comment": "Define a robot.\n\nIs the software that is replacing travel agents a robot?\n\nIs the software that is replacing legal assistants a robot?\n\nAutomation is replacing people, robots are just one form of it.\n\nIf he wants to tax automation in general then just call it what it is, a Business tax, because all businesses use automation of some sort."}, {"comment_id": "ddv10x5", "post_id": "5ulrgf", "comment": "I work at an automated fabrication facility.

To those who say that this is not something that will ever be needed and were just trying to find a way to tax people more, look at it from this perspective.  \n\nPerson A:  Married with two kids, combined income is $200K a year.  ROUGHLY they pay about 30% of their income in federal taxes.  Plus an additional 4-10% in state taxes.  In total roughly 35% of their income goes towards taxes.  So they pay an estimated $70k in taxes each year.  With what is remaining they put about $100K into the economy from buying and paying for goods and services each year.\n\n\nPerson B:  Single filler.  They make $100K each year from their employer.  They also pay roughly 30% in federal taxes, and another 4-10% in state taxes.  Again I'm going with the assumption that they pay about 35% in taxes each year.  This means they are putting $35k into the tax system and spending $60k on goods and services.  \n\nNow lets say that there are 200 of person A and person B at a certain company. Combined they pay on AVERAGE roughly $22 Million in taxes each year.  They also account for $32 Million in payments for goods and services. In total they account for $54 million that directly go back in to the economy (yes, yes I know govt waste and all that)\n\n\nCompany that hires both of these people makes $110 Million a year in income, which means they pay about $38.5 million in taxes each year. The effective rate for a corporation making over $20 Million a year is  capped at 35% (please correct me if im wrong here, im using the IRS numbers).  This same company decides that its cheaper to automate the work that they do and lays off both.  at this point your probably thinking great the company will make more in profits which means they pay more in taxes.  That's where you're wrong.  There is no supply without demand.  Those same people who work for company A are the same people that would buy those products.  But negdcom you say \"those people can just get a job doing something else, and retrain themselves\".  Ask yourself how long before automation takes over most jobs that paid a high salary.  We can't all be artists, architects,  doctors, or any other number of highly specialized fields.  That's just not how society works. \n\nIf you extrapolate those numbers out to 20% or more of the workforce being automated, you can see a situation where our economy will not be able to sustain itself without some way to recoup the loss of funds from automation.  If there's a better way to do this without figuring out some kind of tax for automation, please let me know.  I genuinely would love to hear about it.

There are some pretty important considerations I haven't seen mentioned.\n\nThe first major hurdle I see with this proposal is that MA is part of ISO-NE, which is a regional transmission operator (RTO) that runs the grid and energy markets for all of the New England States. In other words, MA doesn't actually have independent control of its power. It pulls off a grid that spans several states. MA has influence., but it would need the buy-in of other states OR billions upon billions of dollars in investments and radical changes in policy in order to isolate (\"island\") itself. Also, ISO-NE and other organized energy markets are considered interstate commerce and are thus federally regulated. You might guess how that could present a problem.\n\nSecondly there is the issue of how they will go about procuring the renewable energy itself. New England is probably one of the most modern and least constrained grids on the continent, so they are in a better place from a reliability standpoint than most. Nevertheless, they will need to figure out how to provide electricity when it's dark and the wind isn't blowing. Canadian hydropower is an attractive option (Quebec is \u00b198% powered by hydro and wind), but there's only so much of it and they'll have to compete with NY to get it. Either way, it won't get them anywhere near all the way there.\n\nHow to make up the difference? Well, if their target wasn't 100%, but say, a slightly more reasonable 90%, they might be able to do it at a (relatively) low cost by building a bunch of gas turbines in strategic locations to be switched on when needed. With a 100% target, however, they would need to invest heavily - and I mean REALLY heavily - in energy storage. Which is stupid expensive and simply had never been done on that scale. Ever. Who knows though, maybe the prices of batteries will drop enough over the next 15 years to make it a reality.\n\nI'm not trying to be a downer, but there are some real challenges to overcome in order to make this a reality that many very smart people have been trying to solve for many years. Legislators can't just say \"It Shall Be So\" and have it happen, no more then can they expect making cancer illegal to have any actual impact on the real world.

We know this from the stuff Snowden and other whistleblowers have leaked. we know the government had no problem installing \"splitters\" (server splitting cabinets, they literally funneled a copy of all incoming and outgoing internet traffic to the government, essentially splitting your neighbors cable connection but with the entirety of internet traffic) in ATT servers for 10 years. \n\nIt goes much deeper than that as well, they can monitor your travel, when and how you check email, how long you're at work, and numerous other aspects of your life of they wished. Now the \"upside\", if you can call it that, is that they most likely aren't actively compiling and monitoring your data (unless you or on their radar for some reason), they don't have a profile on every American, well most likely they don't...yet, but you do something that they feel requires such they can. They meet with some secret court and through some classified process (maybe not anymore with the car out of the bag?) obtain a warrant.\n\n\nIf that isn't all scary as shit, I don't know what is.

And in general the faces found by the algorithm are too similar to the actual faces, though many different faces could result in the same low-res picture.\n\nIn machine learning, you train your algorithm with a training set, e.g here couples of low-res and high-res pictures. The training process tries to create a high-res picture, then compares it to the actual one, and modifies the parameters according to the errors it has made. This process is done a lot of times until it can re-create all the pictures in the training set. After training the algorithm you are supposed to validate it on a set that is different from the training set, and if you get good results you can hope that it will work on any picture.\n\nBut here, they clearly showcase the algorithm with the same pictures it has been trained with (or they couldn't get details like the earrings right), which is a bad practice and they do it only because using another picture would give a bad result. What they did is called overfitting : they chose a model that is too specific and trained with not enough data, so they get extremely good results on the data from the training set or similar to the training set but would get very bad results for any foreign data.\n\nExamples of good machine learning applications out there are FaceApp or the deep fakes : they work on any face."}, {"comment_id": "eyt18k4", "post_id": "cycadi", "comment": "It\u2019s so in the future even if your pic is blurry the gov\u2019t will be able to identify you...\n\nDamn ain\u2019t that some shit"}, {"comment_id": "eyrffzy", "post_id": "cycadi", "comment": "Lol.

While not being groundbreaking due to our high reliance on nuclear energy, shutting down all coal plants isn't as easy as it sounds.\n\nWhile they only represent 1% of total annual production, coal plants are almost exclusively used as \"additionnal power reserves\" during peak winter consumption of power. Think of coal as our \"emergency auxiliary\".\n\nDeleting all coal plants ties up to the problem of power conservation. So far the only plants capable of \"storing\" power (outside of fossil fuels) are hydroelectric dams, that can simply pump water upstream with additionnal power during low-consumption times, which makes for \"power reserves\" in high-consumption times.\n\nBy the way, this is why Tesla's house-sized batteries are such a big deal. By allowing storage of renewable power, they take away the major inconvenient of reliance on renewable energies: low-production/high-consumption periods.\n\nShutting down all coal plants will probably require some sort of effort in the flexibility of our nuclear potential and our ability to efficiently transport energy across the country. If memory serves, 2021 is not some random date, but the year for which a couple of nuclear reactor refits under way in nuclear power plants will be done, guaranteeing the ability to ramp up power production as needed like coal plants can. The previous 2023 date was the same but with a security margin, so Macron is actually putting some pressure on EDF, France's national electricity company.\n\nSo obviously, shutting down coal plants isn't some major announcement in France. But neither is it completely insignificant. It sorts of signal a desire to embrace a more flexible modern energy grid, with a lesser security margin in production capacity. The kind of energy grid needed to actually rely on renewables further down the line."}, {"comment_id": "dt7vtj9", "post_id": "7sv1oy", "comment": "Fun fact: if it weren\u2019t for France\u2019s coal industry in the 19th century, prehistoric archaeology would not have developed the way it did.

Obviously oil and gas and any carbon being dug out and put into the air is a major problem, it's introducing new carbon and needs to stop, but even without those things the human population has increased dramatically in the last few hundred years and that has increased the scale of the human carbon cycle.  \n\n\nThe population is 7.6 billion today, in 1900 it was 1.6 billion, in 1800 it was just about 1 billion, and for the rest of human history as far as we know it has always been below 1 billion.  So that's just in the last 200 years, and we spiked up dramatically in the last 100.  \n\n\nSo from that perspective you suddenly have 6 billion additional people to feed in the last 100 years. You have 6 billion people worth of land that's no longer idly storing carbon, it is now an active part of the carbon cycle, and many areas that were once carbon dense forests had to be cleared out and made into pasture.  \n\n\nThe goal is then to reduce the amount of land needed, ideally restoring forests which can hold carbon.
