Ads for books (such as Rich Lowry's recent book on nationalism, which had ads canceled) are another example where something can be obviously political while still selling a product. What about ads for a TV show that's about politics or has heavy political elements? Even voter registration ads favor Democrats, since the demographics least likely to be registered already are more likely to vote for Democrats.\n\nThere's a subjective judgment involved as well, which Twitter is already not trusted on. For example, their rule against \"deadnaming\" takes a side on something that is, for better or worse, a very controversial issue. There have also been numerous complaints from Antifa figures about whether posts comprise threats and deserved a ban. Few people trust Twitter to make subjective judgments well, and there's simply no way to have a policy against political ads that's both effective and objective."}, {"comment_id": "f5w7dw7", "post_id": "dpc9ey", "comment": "Hope fb can do so"}, {"comment_id": "f5w3rq1", "post_id": "dpc9ey", "comment": "I am concerned there are Americans who decide who to vote because a candidate has likes and followers on twitter or Facebook.

It should let you prove that a certain clip belongs to a certain camera because only the camera that produced the clip will reverse the hash function properly (barring someone getting at your camera and tearing it down to get at the salt) \n\nAny editing/transcoding or modification of the file produces a whole new file with different properties (size, codec and hash being among them) and you can't prove that it came from a physical device like a particular divorcee's phone because you can't match the salt. \n\nYou can't walk into court with a Sony A7 or something and say that the footage was taken on it because when you present the file to the camera for reversing the hash then it'll go \"this isn't my original\".\n\nThis puts the onus on camera companies to keep the salt safe from intrusion attacks and maybe record them in a database at the time of manufacture, only to be disclosed to police.\n\nOn the other hand, this also means that a photo taken on your phone can be traced back to you- if the police suspect you then the image can be shown to the camera which then confirms that it came from you.

If a government owned social media platform somehow took hold, and people flocked to it, the same users spreading chain messages, conspiracy theories, witch hunting, and all the other things that happen on social media would happen over there too.  The only thing people get mad at Facebook, Google, and Twitter for is not deleting content that they don't like, and the algorithms that show you things.  But how would the PBS of social media change that?  I think they would have even less power to delete post, since there is a first amendment issue there that private companies don't have.  So in that case it may be worse.  The PBS of social media probably wouldn't have the algorithms that show you related content, since they would not care about maximizing your screen time, but that would probably mean that you would see what is sent to you, or just what you search for.  So all those user creating crap content would just pull every trick in the book to get their political opinion or span sent to as many people as possible, and outsmart the search filters to get their crap #1.\n\nThe other thing, this would never work in my opinion because the government would not care about maximizing people's screen times, like Facebook, Twitter, and Google already do.  This means the core users that are addicting to social media wouldn't switch over, because Facebook, Twitter, and Google and doing all the tricks to keep them involved.  Without a core userbase, a social media platform can't survive.  I don't think it would ever get off the ground.

Often times, these expectations turn into contracts, and the vendor company will do anything to keep a multi-million contract with a large global company, both for brand and profit. This means, they will squeeze their employees rather than renegotiate. This engine keeps the money in the hands of the rich and drains the poor of their lives, souls, and keep them in the lower class."}, {"comment_id": "erl070e", "post_id": "c2gp2g", "comment": "Omg Facebook hire me, I watch a shit load of YNC"}, {"comment_id": "erlh99p", "post_id": "c2gp2g", "comment": "I have seen a man still alive get his chest skinned and rib cage broken so they could rip out the guys hearts.

Restrictions on reporting to the police, regulators and other authorities including giving the other party notice before doing so.  \n>  \n>b. Limits on the ability of the individual party to seek professional advice or counselling after entering into the agreement because the confidentiality agreement is too stringent.  \n>  \n>c. Clawback / forfeiture clauses under which in the event of breach of confidentiality, derogatory statements or nonassistance provisions settlement monies may be forfeited and, if already paid, required to be repaid, potentially with costs of recovery, especially if coupled with other aggressive terms.  \n>  \n>d. Terms that are legally potentially unenforceable \u2013 e.g. blanket confidentiality provisions and clawback provisions, as well as restrictions on reporting potentially criminal behaviour to the police or making any \u201cprotected disclosures\u201d under whistleblowing legislation.   \n>  \n>e.

Maybe they can lift the emission of usable radiation from 700C to 1000C, but photovoltaics run below 100C, so boosting photovoltaics efficiency with Rice University boosted waste heat collected by TPV is not feasible. \n\nConcentrated Solar Power runs at up to 750 C, so they could harvest some of the waste energy with a Rice Univeristy boosted TPV. But then they could only use the very small waste heat that gets lost before the steam hits the first turbine. That's useful, but it wouldn't boost efficiency more than 5%.\n\nTo really get that 80% efficiency they'd have to concentrate solar to 1400 C, boost spectrum with Rice University tech and then harvest with a room-temperature cooled TPV. The Rice University tech only boosts parallel polarization and the TPV would need to be big, because it needs to be cooled. It would be expensive, because cheap silicon PV are inefficient as TPVs.\n\nThe big problem is that the limiting factor for photovoltaics is power per area, as you have to cool them to around room temperature and you can't use room temperature coolant for power generation.\n\nLike CSP that would only work with direct sunlight, and the TPV cells have to be actively cooled because they surround a 1400C emitter. If you have direct sunlight you can also split the sun's spectrum and divert it to multiple, cheaper panels.\n\nMaybe they could use heat from garbage incinerators, that's around 2000C.

I think it's a demonstrable fact that the development of new technology initially for racing does lead to the refinement and improvement of the technology in the cars available for sale to the public.

If we are talking about a factory sponsored racing team you can make the case that it's just a different pocket, really the same source, but you find out what works (and what really doesnt) more quickly on the track. \nIf you want to make the case that it's a waste in relation to the overall degradation of the environment,  well that's a viable argument.  The thing is though I think these are two different things that a person could focus on.\nEdit also since electric cars came up in this thread: yes they do accelerate faster. They generally work pretty well. Like any other batteries,  the batteries in an electric car can only do so many cycles of charge discharge and then they have to be replaced. Right now that's pretty expensive. As production of these cars (and trucks and buses) increases economy of scale will drive the price down. That's one obstacle and the way to overcome it you can already see. Of course an aftermarket for these batteries will also develop. Another problem exists though.

That's $4,400 too high.\n\nBut I hope that in the future: non-crazy orange Cheeto type leaders will reinstate taxpayer money going into my pocket if I buy an electric vehicle.\n\n**Edit**: Three hours after my comment, [the federal government announced an incentive program](https://driving.ca/auto-news/news/new-federal-ev-incentives-offer-up-to-5000-back-on-27-models-and-trims) for electrics under $45,000 (i.e. no Model 3)"}, {"comment_id": "el3mqwh", "post_id": "be4jqp", "comment": "Will the electric grid manage the amount of charging needed?"}, {"comment_id": "el3j4al", "post_id": "be4jqp", "comment": "I can see electric cars being a bad thing for people who travel long commutes or take several road trips.

You need people to learn COBOL, they\u2019ll go learn it. \n\nNow, saying the software doesn\u2019t meet their needs, and saying they have trouble funding it because it\u2019s expense not capital, and having a population that wants more services but pays less taxes...well, those are real problems.

That happened in 1948, almost 1900 years after the destruction of Israels second temple. The bible makes it clear that this age is almost up. The rapture and disappearance of millions of Christians will soon take place. Soon, this world will enter a period of great peace that will be brought forth by the antichrist. Destruction will follow after that period of peace and everything will change. The antichrist will put out a mark that will go into your right hand or forehead. Without it, you won\u2019t be able to buy or sell. I tell you all of these things so that you can believe later since I know that none of you will believe now. You have two options for this evil period. Submit to the antichrist or submit to Jesus and refuse the mark. Believe that Jesus died and rose for your sins and refuse the mark under all circumstances. It\u2019s very important that you don\u2019t take it"}, {"comment_id": "f5b6fey", "post_id": "dnb4yd", "comment": "And we'll have flying cars too!"}, {"comment_id": "f5cd1x9", "post_id": "dnb4yd", "comment": "Tesla would be proud.
