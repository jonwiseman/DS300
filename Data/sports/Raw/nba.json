You say what you believe in, and ask honest questions about what you dont know about, and everyone has a chance to grow and learn.\n\nHiding to try and protect your brand is the EXACT thing that will devalue it and make you look like a cheap phony. It weakens your stance on *everything*, even the things you do know a lot about and want to champion. It's just a weak move to not say what you think. Accept the possibility that you can be wrong or ill-prepared or less informed, because that is the only way you can grow. Nobody says the right thing every time, but I can guarantee you that trying to say nothing is almost always the wrong move. You rob others of a chance to hear a powerful opinion, or on the other hand rob yourself of a chance to learn and be humbled.\n\nSome things are bigger than basketball, and even bigger than a single important event. Some things set a precedent for how a platform is used for *all* events going forward. Dont set the example that you hide from things and only support causes for things that you can see yourself in, because that is not how any type of unity spreads.

Halfway through it, I got hungry so I left it playing and went to the kitchen to fix my self a sandwich. But then I found out that I'm out of mayonnaise so I went to a store. There, I saw the most beautiful woman I have ever seen in my whole life. But I'm really a shy person so I took up a three-year personality development course so I can introduce my self. She was very friendly and all, but unfortunately, she has a boyfriend. So I said, all good, I'm a mature person. I want the best for her and I harbor no illusion that I am the best person for her and she seems happy with her boyfriend, so I did not bother her anymore. But we kept in touch and we became friends and I got over my crush on her. Then she broke up with her boyfriend, we drank some alcohol because of it, I told her she'll be fine and I wished her well. I still think she's the most beautiful woman in the world, but like I said, I am over my crush on her. It was like five years already when I first saw her. Besides, I am quiet happy with the friendship I developed with her. It was more important than a crush. So we kept hanging out, drinking, having coffee, and all. I had a girlfriend, she started dating other guys. My girlfriend wants to live some other life without me in it, so I said, okay, I want the best for you and I want you to pursue your happiness. My lady friend and I drank alcohol about it, and she gave me the same advice I gave her when she was in that position and I became okay with the breakup immediately. But we were really drunk, so she spent the night in my apartment. I only have one bed, so you know what that means: She took the bed and I slept on the couch. But on the couch, I really can't sleep. Something was bothering me. So I tossed and turned for about three hours, then I finally can't take it anymore, I stood up and went straight to my room where she's sleeping. I approached the bed, gently sat on it and I reached for her shoulder to pull her closer to me. She stirred and woke up. She asked what's up. I told her, you know, the first time I saw you, I was watching the Raptors game and left it playing to get my self a sandwich then went to the store to get some mayo then I got distracted by life that I forgot to see how the game ended. She said, you know what, I've been wondering about a weird noise in your night drawer.

Then here I was, in the windy city, watching my first Bulls game on TV, and Derrick Rose's moves perpetually made me a Bulls fan for live. I was so convinced that he might be the most talented point guard in the history of NBA, if anyone argues with me, I would go bonkers.\n\nAfter a few years of ups and downs, Derrick Rose hits the famous buzzer beater against the Cavs at United Center, that was the most exciting feeling I have ever felt in my life, ever, although LeBron shot them down the next game, it was amazing.\n\nDerrick Rose got traded to the Knicks, the Old Bulls fell apart, Jimmy Butler became the alpha and the Chicago Favorite, and every Rose #1 Bulls jersey in the city has disappeared. I felt sad, but I understand how much of a toll the injuries have taken on Derrick Rose, and I just wished him to have a healthy career on the Knicks.\n\nOf course he didn't then he moved to the Cavs, then the whole Cavs trading fiasco happened, than he got waived by the Jazz, I felt extremely sad. Is this really the end for the Windy City Assassin?\n\nFast forward to tonight, he hits threes, he drives to the lane, he passes the ball like White Chocolate, he got 50 points. Career high, at the Timberwolves, in Minnesota.\n\nI am crying. The haters do not understand the struggles he went through.\n\nWhen he left the team in the Knicks, I was probably the only few guys defending him on the internet, I got buried in downvotes.\n\nThis season, I can feel his energy everytime he steps on the floor. He is on a mission, and is not just coasting for a 10/5/5 stat, but to prove himself to the world that although he might be forgotten, he has not lost his love for Basketball.\n\nDrive home safe Chicago, the Derrick Rose you love has never left.\n\n&#x200B;"}, {"comment_id": "e8tttkh", "post_id": "9t5n2y", "comment": "get that postgame interview up"}, {"comment_id": "e8ttu04", "post_id": "9t5n2y", "comment": "ESPN tomorrow \u201cRose drops 50, what does this mean for LeBron and the Lakers.\u201d\n\nIn all seriousness, as a Rose fan from the beginning this is amazing.

In his second year, he made all star team and further established himself as a force in the league. Now comes his third year which was the best year of his career, he won MVP and carried the bulls to the eastern conference final against the heat where he lost again Lebron, Wade and Bosh aka the superteam of that time(think the warriors right now). Anyhow, at that moment there was no one seen as better than D Rose in the entire league except Lebron(obviously a top 5 player of all time). The sky was the limit for Rose at this point, personally that's when I started watching basketball. He's my favorite player of all time despite me cheering for all boston teams in all sports. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHere comes the 4th year, after a good season, the bulls play the 76ers in the first round and in the first game, it happened. D Rose teared his acl after not landing properly. He didn't play the whole next year because of the injury, and when he came back the year after he got injured again and didn't play for a long time once again. This is the downfall of a player that was gonna dominate the game, he never been able to recover, he got traded to the knicks and then signed with cavs for peanuts. Nothing worked, he has been confined to a bench role, most thought he was done playing basketball, the injuries killed him.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFast forward, this summer, he signs a small contract with the wolves to sign with his old bulls coach(which is a meme because a lot of old bulls players got signed there with Thibodeau) who now is the coach and gm of the wolves. Anyhow, the season just started and D Rose has been very good so far in every game(except the last I think not 100% sure). Anyhow, today he got to start because Teague(point guard) got injured monday. We got to see old D Rose drop a 50 points game, he hadn't scored 40+ points since 2011 to give you an idea of what he accomplished today. Everyone was chanting MVP during the game, this was such a special moment for the love of the game. Honestly, I would love for him to have a huge year, he never gave up and he deserves some redemption after all the bad luck he's had. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nHoping for 2019 MVP D Rose, get em!"}, {"comment_id": "e8ttutu", "post_id": "9t5n2y", "comment": "Why am I crying in the club rn?"}, {"comment_id": "e8ttw0a", "post_id": "9t5n2y", "comment": "Fine.

Honestly I think it's funny how redditors think they're making any change in the world by \"exposing\" China and companies that bow down to them. This is what the Chinese government wants you to do anyway. Mao Zedong said political power grows out of the barrel of the gun. Meanwhile we have redditors using some Chinese propaganda forum to spread awareness to other white people by posting memes that will be forgotten when the next outage comes. That is as non threatening as you can get. I wouldn't be surprised if the Chinese communist government likes this kind of opposition... The non threatening type that reposts memes that cycle weekly but are quickly forgotten until they're back in rotation. At least the rednecks that hate China try to actively fight it by boycotting products made in China and buying from the good old USA. Meanwhiles redditors who complain about China use this website which sucks China's dick. I don't see how all this fake outrage posts on Reddit are any different than those white celebrities who were into the whole free Tibet thing but didn't know any people from there or really gave any crap in real life. \n\nI'm starting to see the pattern with these outrage posts. So its LeBron this week? Last week it was the Chinese president, the weak before it was Trump, before it was Putin, and before that it's Islam. Wouldn't be surprised if next week is \"daily reminder that Chinese use bear vile to cure boners!\" Or some other lame post. \n\nWhat I think it's funny is you have all these people from Hong Kong trying to spread their message to the world and thinking Americans are going to give a crap to help them when that's not going to happen. If you want to oppose Hong Kong don't make allies with liberal white people, who will only fight the battle through memes on a pro Chinese website."}, {"comment_id": "dtllzl7", "post_id": "7un836", "comment": "IT getting all buddy buddy with dan gilbert so he can \n\nMove in\n\nAfter\n\nCompletion"}, {"comment_id": "dtlo9ry", "post_id": "7un836", "comment": "Damn.

Between 8:16 and 9:11 pm, Wikipedia contributors battled back and forth, adding and removing various causes of the retirement and/or death of Wesley Johnson. A total of 280 edits were registered in those 55 glorious minutes. Here is a abridged timeline of the events:  \n\nThe original shit-post, posted at 8:16 PST: Johnson's career ended early when James Harden broke his ankles, stared him down, and shot a 3-pointer on February 28th, 2018.  \n\nOne minute later another user added this subtle piece in Johnson's Clippers section: On February 28th 2018 his career was killed by a James Harden cross over.  \n\n7 minutes later, another user adds to his personal info: Father: James Harden.  \n\nFor the next 15 minutes, several edits lead us to this:  \n\nJohnson died on February 28, 2018 after James Harden cooked him and put him in a bodybag. He could not be rushed to a nearby hospital as his ankles were glued to the ground. Wesley's funeral will be held in the secret tunnel that Chris Paul used to get to the locker room. His mother later disowned him posthumously.  \n\nThen the mods caught on, and over 250 edits took place back and forth, shit-posts and revisions being posted at astonishing rates. Between 8:47 and 8:52 alone, 53 edits were posted, averaging 1 edit every 5.6 seconds. Here are some of the best:  \n\nOn February 28, 2018, Houston Rockets SG James Harden murdered Wesley's ankles on national television. James proceeded to stare into Johnson's soul before draining a 3 & ending his life. He's expected to announce his retirement after the game.  \n\nHis career came to a close after James Harden viciously snatched his ankles mid game on Febuaray 28th, 2018.  \n\nOn February 28, 2017, Wesley got dropped my James Harden, who cooked him up. This subsequently ended Johnson\u2019s career.  \n\nOn February 28, 2018 Johnson tragically broke both of his ankles in one of the meanest moves of this generation.  \n\nOn February 28, 2018 Johnson had his ankles shattered by the bearded monster Harden. His basketball career also ended that day, as he announced his retirement immediately afterwards.  \n\nDeath:\nOn February 28, 2018, Wesley was brutally murdered by James Harden. An LAPD investigation determined that Wesley died from blood loss after breaking his ankles. His family changed their last names out of shame. Hopefully, he finds the secret tunnel into the afterlife.  \n\nAnd then he got rekt by the Beard with tears in his eyes as the ball splashed all over him.  \n\nOn February 28th he had a career ending ankle injury resulting in the amputation of his legs due to a James Harden crossover.  \n\nOn February 28, Johnson's career was forced to end abruptly after James Harden viciously broke his ankles, stared at him for 3 whole seconds, then proceeded to drain a 3 in his face. Wesley Johnson post game said \" I can't do this anymore. James Harden is my father, I don't see the point in playing this game anymore.\" He proceeded to cry and take his bags to James Harden's house where he will live there for 12 more years.  \n\nHis career was ended by his daddy James Harden by the most deadliest crossover in NBA history.  \n\nOn February 28, 2018, Johnson became the first NBA player to die on-court, when James Harden took his ankles, and his life.  \n\nOn February 28, 2018, Johnson lost his ankles, dignity, and pride from being sauced by James Harden.  \n\nOn February 28, 2018, Johnson had to retire after getting crossed over badly by James Harden. He was carried off the court in a stretcher never to play basketball again.

He was so different from what I'd known basketball to be that I fell in love instantly. His weird herky-jerky playstyle and impossible passes were like magic unfolding before my eyes. Before I knew it, I was following the Spurs religiously and the rest of the NBA like it was something I'd been missing all my life.\n\nThank you for everything, Manu. You've made the impossible happen so many times that I can't even begin to point to a favorite highlight. Your attitude, your candor, your passion --- what a player and, more importantly, what a human being you are.

They show up at church and school fuctions, they behave respectfully in public, and they are figureheads of our city because of how they behave off the court. Tim duncan is no exception to this, ive met him a few times and everytime he has been soft spoken  and polite. He is a captain in our city. And always will be, even if he doesn't live here.

Seeing this, Boogie thinks that the biggest and best way to regrow his stock and throw a giant fuck-you to everyone that doubted him (which is pretty much his brand at his point) would be to join what is already the greatest team of all time. \n\nNow think about it. There would be absolutely no pressure on Boogie at all to come back early in the season, he can spend all the time he needs rehabbing and making sure hes in a good spot, and even when he does return, there is even less expectation on him to carry the team. Hes replacing Javale Mcgee and Zaza fucking Pachulia, not exactly the cornerstones of the Warriors. This move will essentially allow him to make a full recovery with absolutely no pressure on when he needs to return or the level hes expected to play at. \n\n\nNow, I'm certain that Boogie fully expects himself to ball out upon his return, which will kickstart the rise in his stock. If hes even able to return to 80% of his former self by the end of the season and the Warriors inevitable 4th title in 5 years, he will absolutely be a hot commodity when his current deal runs out one year from now. And it never hurts to have a title under your belt, we know how the NBA loves to tack on additional millions just because you got a ring, even if you were a bench warmer.

But this level of dominance is barely enough to get by the Pacers, who are a respectable team but past Cavs/Heat teams with LeBron would have been able to get past the first 2 rounds without breaking a sweat. \n\nThey are up 3-2 and it took a buzzer beater to get the series lead after they went down twice in the series. The Cavs might have to go 7 games to get past the Pacers. \n\nIf I were a Sixers fan I would be very happy about my teams chances of getting to the NBA Finals. A lot could happen and I would still be on LeBron in most series but the Cavs just look way too vulnerable right now. \n\nI think that the Cavs might have to give TT some minutes off the bench. Just play him 12-15 minutes and see how he does. You need some energy on the team, give TT 12-15 good minutes and he gets you 2 offensive rebounds and a fast break dunk, that might be the kind of grit you need against the Pacers. I also think they need to start playing Cedi a bit more. \n\nI think you have to give Cedi 10 minutes at the very least. Cedi can come in and give you a three pointer or two and a tough rebound or a nice assit. The ball doesn't stick to him either which doesn't gum up the offense. They have to give either Hood or JR less minutes when they are off. Neither or good defenders (both are OK defenders, Hood is still learning and JR has lost a step) and when they are off shooting wise you have to try something to keep them from shooting you out of the game. Cedi could give you something. \n\nIt's LeBron, Love, and a bunch of role players. To win with that you better use every player on your roster most effectively. You see the Spurs do this with their role players and it made every Spurs player seem better than what they are on most other teams.

I\u2019d like to think the knicks have been doing their due diligence for a while and things just so happened to leak on the same day, but given the deal itself, it seems rushed. I get KP will be coming back from an ACL injury. I get he probably told us he was only going to sign the QO. But was this seriously the best deal we could\u2019ve gotten? Couldn\u2019t a better team have come calling? We have a week until the deadline.\n\nI\u2019d say about 75% of this falls on the franchise. 3 HC\u2019s since he\u2019s been here, change in regime, from his view we did his mentor in Carmelo dirty, and we stink. With that being said, the other 25% of me feels KP and his brother are being a bit irrational. What did he expect of this season? And I get players hate tanking, but can\u2019t he see the silver lining in this season? We could\u2019ve put a really good player next to him via the draft, and our cap space was going to gradually improve. Did he not like what he saw from frank, knox, Mitch, vonleh, dot, trier? None of those guys (with the expection of knox) have the potential to be world beaters, but pieces that could be good if used properly. He would\u2019ve been the man here.\n\nIt\u2019s all confusing, conflicting, and really stings, and overall as a knicks fan this is absolutely the worst day in recent memory, even worse than when we found out he tore his acl.\n\nMavs and fans, my hat is off to you. It will sting watching those two play together but wow I\u2019m happy for you guys. Between dirk and Carlisle, kp will be used very well. My only question for you guys is how you think dsj will progress, because to me he\u2019s the crown jewel of the trade for us and it\u2019s a shitty jewel given what we gave up.

This is my love letter to Dirk. \n\nI moved to Dallas in 2000 when I was 9 years old. The Mavericks are the thing that I first \"adopted\" when I got here and is what helped me smoothly assimilate into this new place. Dirk has been there at the forefront the entire time. \n\nSo many memories. So many highs and lows. I remember forming my early dislike for the Spurs and Kings in those early 2000s playoffs battles. I remember clinching the 2006 WCF against the Suns and the tears and heartbreak after the 2006 Finals. 2007 regular season was a fucking blast. 67 wins. My mans MVP OF THE LEAGUE. We coming back for that chip. Losing to the Warriors in the first round felt like a new low...it killed me hearing Dirk getting called \"soft\" and decidedly never going to be capable of taking his team all the way. After the seething rage of getting upset by Golden State passed, the following few seasons were very meh to me. I began to wonder if all the critics were right after all. \n\nThen 2011 happened. That two month stretch from April to June is forever ingrained into my being. I vividly remember every single playoff game during that Mavs run. I remember panicking when Brandon Roy went unstoppable in game 4 against the Blazers and we blew a 23 point lead...thought \"cool, here we go again\". I remember the closeout sweep game against the 2x defending champion Lakers when we made it straight FLOOD 3's in the AAC. I was at Game 5 of the WCF against OKC when we clinched our spot back to the Finals, going complete apeshit with my dad and brother, the entire arena screaming \"BEAT THE HEAT\". I still sometimes get reverbs of how intense I was during Game 2 of the Finals. When we sealed the deal and that trophy started coming out to the court, watching Dirk run into the locker room to privately experience his emotion made me swell with so much god damn pride for this man. Legend. Knowing that particular championship run and Dirk's performance specifically will be talked about as one of the greatest is like crack to me. That's my guy. That's my team. \n\nWatching the man play has been nothing short of euphoric. Dirk is Dallas. It genuinely is hard to encapsulate into words what he means to me, this city, the sport of basketball. I am glad I got to see your swan song tonight first hand. I am happy I got to see the tens of thousands like myself who adore you and shower you with the praise you deserve. I am sad it's over. I am nervous things won't be the same without you. But I am excited for what you do next, even if it's chilling for the rest of your life. \n\nI've never shot a crumpled up piece of paper into the garbage while sitting down or yelling \"Kobe!\". I'm up. I'm pushing my left leg back and kicking out the right out while leaning backwards and yelling \"DIRK!\". And I will continue to do so.\n\nThank you, Dirk Werner Nowitzki.

Sure, tons of firsts and pick swaps to make it easy long term plus a great start with SGA and whatever young players you get from Westbrook.\n\n-do nothing? Hell, still works. Sit on our hand as the team in the NBA with the absolute most draft capital, and wait to use it until it's the right time. It's long-term picks, so it's a more stable asset than say, a pick coming in the next 3 years that would be unlikely to be even a lottery pick (from the clippers or heat Tbh). \n\n\n\nThe truth is, winning a championship with PG and Russ was always going to be a huge longshot - especially with so many dangerously good teams around now.

Can you imagine what we would be screaming about if these two got CO-ROTY like J Kidd and Grant Hill did back in the day? The internet might actually break.
