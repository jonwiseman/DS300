He should have retired two years ago and at least maintained some dignity.\n\nOur midfield as a whole is one of the most embarrassing things I've ever seen on a pitch. Their ability to link defense and attack is so bad I sometimes think we'd actually be better just playing some kind of 5 and 5 formation with nothing but attackers and backs. Would such a formation really cause us to be less creative or sloppier in the middle of the pitch?\n\nThis shit is not the beautiful game. Using sloppy, slow, and non-aggressive sideways and backpasses to setup poorly chosen route 1 passes to well-covered attackers shouldn't even qualify as soccer.\n\nWe have the link up play of a team that parks the bus, except that we don't have a bus. We just attack that poorly even though our defense is still loose as a retiring whore, and use counter attacking offensive moves against teams whose defenses are already positioned and organized. \n\nAs long as our country's national team has tactics that can't even rival some high school squads, we should not be at all surprised or disappointed that we missed the chance to embarrass ourselves by holding up a player of Bradleys ability as a national model on the world stage.\n\nI'm perfectly happy to hide that shame until someone who actually wants to play soccer gains control of our national program and releases the incompetent boobs who have lived off half-true, long-past mythology for half of their shit careers. \n\nWe got exactly what we deserved tonight.

The way he just kept faking the cross and instead of forcing it like almost every other player would do he did both the intelligent and shrewd play with winning the corner. This is a 20 year old doing this and to even add that I think the largest mistake of many professional players that you will see is their lack of observation in terms of where they are on the field. You can practice crossing so many times and just have preset plays from practice but there is that vision that separates one from the heap. So while I am gushing on that corner I just thought \"how fitting it would be if this resulted in a goal. He really deserves it, it would teach countless players around the world a good lesson. But its always a small chance on a corner.\"\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHe then followed up with the play that only will be on the highlight real, and I had a sports orgasm. I mean I'll be honest I was cheering for Liverpool hardcore here. There were so many good things that could have lead up to this 4th goal but my goodness I think I just have a hard on for intelligent plays and the culmination of this play was comparable to being single and having the most beautiful women with the best personality ever going on numerous great dates with you and having numerous amounts of great sex followed by your marriage day where you make her orgasm numerous times and you can both tell its the best sex of both your lives and at that point you ejaculate."}, {"comment_id": "emrrpjy", "post_id": "blvvi5", "comment": "HOLY SHIT ON A PRINGLE"}, {"comment_id": "emrrovg", "post_id": "blvvi5", "comment": "LADS"}, {"comment_id": "emrrpuo", "post_id": "blvvi5", "comment": "I WAS HERE"}, {"comment_id": "emrs22l", "post_id": "blvvi5", "comment": "Wowww Trent Alexander-Arnold.

Florenzi is highly more effective while playing on the side. \n\n- If the goal was to cross the ball every time it went to attack, having two good passing defensive midfielders would've been best.

I repeat! Post is staying at 51st!\n\nEDIT 20: Post is now 47th! This is a pretty big milestone because just under is the \"Chelsea win the PL\" post.\n\nEDIT 21: 46th right now, marking the slowest possible uptick. Won't become top 10 post as people were predicting...\n\nEDIT 22: 45th. Slowly but surely we are getting there. Competition from above is \"Hazard destroying a kid post-match\" and [ADO den Haag goalkeeper equaliser in the 94th minute vs PSV](https://streamable.com/axco).\n\nEDIT 23: 44th. Will be suprised to see it in top 30.\n\nEDIT 24: 41st! Pretty impressive compared to the army level crawl that we sat through for the past 20 minutes.\n\nEDIT 25: 40th. Back to where we are apparently.\n\nEDIT 26: 38th. Just above it is the match thread for 2014 WC Final, just under is Vardy's scorcher against Liverpool. You can tell we're heading to legendary status.\n\nEDIT 27: 37th! This has really suprised me. I really thought this was the limit but they keep on going just one more.\n\nEDIT 28: 34th right now. This is where the fun should end for the thread. The 29th most upvoted thread has 22k, meanwhile the 30th has 20k. Slow times are ahead.\n\n**EDIT 29:** The post is stuck at 34th, just like my prediction. Really want it up after 17 excruciating days, so sorry if I look like a Debbie downer.\n\nEDIT 30: 32nd, with 600 upvotes needed to move up one spot.\n\nEDIT 31: 32nd still, and we might see a bigger number in edits than post number.\n\nEDIT 32: This is the slowest crawl I've ever seen. By now, the post gains 200 upvotes per 5 minutes so next time should be higher. (32nd obviously)\n\nEDIT 33: Still 32nd. I actually refreshed multiple times to see, but nope. If it reaches top 30 within 10 posts will continue, otherwhise not.\n\nEdit 34: 32nd looks like the biggest it can get right now. I think it's frozen.\n\nEdit 35: I legit think it's frozen. It's been stuck on 20K for 5 edits now.\n\nEdit 36: Second to last edit if it doesn't advance.\n\n~~edit 37: Well RIP. After 17 days of will he-won't he Neymar's record breaking, almost law-defying, lawyer involving, Pique lying, standard setting, Qatari funded transfer bonanza is finally over. And so is my quest to see it's placement.~~\n\nEDIT 38: IGNORE WHAT I WAS SAYING. I WAS FOLLOWING THE TRANSFER SO THOROUGHLY REDDIT BROKE. AFTER REFRESHING I FOUND THE POST IS NOW THE 19TH MOST UPVOTED POST ON REDDIT. MORE TO FOLLOW.\n\nEDIT 39: [Proof that shows I wasn't lying on the 32nd placement.](http://imgur.com/t5IVYcS)\n\nEDIT 40: This will be my last update as I feel all people who are interested have already upvoted. Will return one last time after the UEFA Champions League/Europa League draw to see if anything changes. \n\nAll in all it was a semi-succesful post, but I feel that it should have been a top 10 post, so a slight underachievement, but not like the 32nd I mistakenly I thought was the number.\n\nEDIT 41: If you're still interested in what I have to say then this is for you. The post isn't even a day old and it's in the top 5. I won't cross out the 40th edit because it's actually true this time and who knows what will happen within a couple of hours, maybe it crosses the top 3, but absolutely not #1. The amazement of Leicester's victory is something not even Neymar's transfer to PSG can overcome. \n\nMy over and under estimation was clearly shown throughout the history of this and it shows a real curve in how much every higher spot gets more and more important. For comparison when I first posted this the post it was 388th. The current 388th is [Deja vu ... Wenger having the same season again and again](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/5te047/deja_vu_wenger_having_the_same_season_again_and/). The post above it, [The Worst Goals of the Season Compilation](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6e8u4g/the_worst_goals_of_the_season_compilation/) has only 30 more upvotes. This explains why the post jumped up 102 spots within 5 minutes. Little competition from the posts allowed it to move up faster. Another important factor was that when it became clear /u/guisasolaa 's thread was the one to break the news, a massive surge occured. If it was any other post from the top 100-200, it would have made big leaps, but nothing compared to 102 spots up.\n\nMeanwhile, there is a 2,500 point gap between the [4th post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/5yaurn/barcelona_61_paris_sg_sergio_roberto_905/) and [6th most upvoted post](https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/6goyl5/michael_bradley_goal_against_mexico_01/) which shows why the post hasn't improved recently, bigger gaps. Another thing that doesn't help is all Europeans on r/all or browsers of r/soccer have most likely upvoted this post without enough interest from Americans. According to Google Trends in the past 30 days, Neymar is a hot topic in Brazil, West Africa and Western Europe. Not a single city in the US is interested in the transfer, which means that a small fraction of people who upvoted this were American. Considering that reddit is mostly American, it makes sense that the post wasn't upvoted by people browsing r/all, they most likely weren't interested.\n\nIf there is more interest, I will make a follow up post."}, {"comment_id": "dl50y6m", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "Congratulations PSG you have added a whole fucking country to your fan base."}, {"comment_id": "dl4iok0", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siSZlQkYbTY\n\nhttp://i.imgur.com/stClWdA.gif\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JOE_co_uk/status/892694669276192768\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Ikseau/status/892745963940524033\n\nhttps://twitter.com/PSG_English/status/893162222905643009\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dl4l6mv", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "Thread moving so fast nobody will notice that I'm gay."}, {"comment_id": "dl4helr", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "You've won the karma race OP"}, {"comment_id": "dl4ozge", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "I still can't believe that a person can be worth 222 million for kicking a football , it's mental"}, {"comment_id": "dl4vwld", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "Barca front three is now officially MS Paint"}, {"comment_id": "dl4het7", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "How did this even happen "}, {"comment_id": "dl4laf2", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "[It's finally over!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogaV_9cUbQo)\n\nWell, at least until the FFP case gets heard."}, {"comment_id": "dl4ownd", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "You can literally hear FIFA executives licking their lips with all the pay offs err I mean money being made legally"}, {"comment_id": "dl4qgws", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "Some person in Qatar paid 220 million for a tattooed nutsack! absolute madman."}, {"comment_id": "dl4m770", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "Semedo won"}, {"comment_id": "dl4ln8c", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "In 5 years we'll be looking back on this and thinking \"Man, what a steal.\" as Ronaldo transfers to the Qatari Ultrastars in exchange for 6 countries."}, {"comment_id": "dl4ibkq", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "MOM GET THE CAMERA"}, {"comment_id": "dl4ktzt", "post_id": "6rev48", "comment": "I was promised tattooed nutsack and I shall see it.

His arrest also comes during the Women's World Cup.\n\n> Just at the start of the month, Platini was seated on the terrace of a Parisian hotel on a rainy Tuesday showing signs of regret. He might have been meeting Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace, as his former friend Gianni Infantino was that morning, or preparing to address FIFA's 211 members as the organisation's president, as Infantino would do later in the week. He might have been basking in the glow of hosting the Women's World Cup in his home country.\n\n> Instead, Platini was at the Peninsula Hotel, quietly fuming, counting down the days of his exile from the sport that has been his life's work.\n\n> Platini's world, and his dreams of running world football, came crashing down in the aftermath of the 2015 scandal. Platini has watched from the sideline as Infantino, his former deputy and a lifetime administrator, has ridden the slipstream of scandal to become the most powerful man in football.\n\n> Platini and Infantino no longer speak. \"He would not be UEFA general secretary without me, and he wouldn't be FIFA president without me,\" Platini said.\n\n> **But before his arrest, as the end of his ban approaches Platini was plotting a comeback.  \"I don't know what exactly,\" he said, \"but I will be back.

Here's a description about the importance of the goal.\n\nThere's a tournament called the Champions League, where the best teams in Europe play at this stage of the tournament. There are always 2 games between those teams, where both team plays at home and away. Now, the first time they played, Barcelona lost 4-0 to PSG. Everyone thought it was over. There has been 0 teams in the history coming back from such a deficit. No one was really expecting anything, but as the second game started, Barcelona scored an early goal. During first half time, Barcelona were leading 2-0 (still 2 goals away).\n\nThen, at second half, Barcelona scored another early goal making it 3-0. Now they are 1 goal away. There's about 40 minutes left to play and everyone got hyped up and were looking at an historical moment, atleast for a start. As the hype built up, Barcelona conceded a goal making it 3-1. This means Barcelona must win with atleast 6 goals. This 3-1 scoreline was within the last 20 minutes of the game, and the hype that was built up, soon vanished. I mean, who can score 3 goals in 20 minutes against a top tier team? Anyway, as the game went on, Barcelona scored 4-1 in the 88th minute with only few more minutes left to play. Everyone was like, meh, a goal that doesn't mean much. Still need 2 goals in basically 5 minutes. Then 5-1 came, with a few more minutes to play and people were hyped again and began opening their eyes for the last seconds. Then the unbelievable happened and they actually turned it around, and the goal in the video is the last goal they needed to advance, and it really happened. Score Barca 6-1 PSG (PSG 4-0 Barca from first match), a total of 6-5.\n\nAll in all, no one expected an advancement from Barcelona. But as they took the lead early on, everyone was building up hype and soon came the counter goal and the hype was dead until they turned it around by 3 magical last minute goals."}, {"comment_id": "deoj6sw", "post_id": "5yaurn", "comment": "Sergi Roberto, Barca legend.

The number 3 who was going spare after the offside goal was chalked off should have been sent off... Two straight red challenges which only got yellows... The petulance of the players (spitting, screaming in players faces while on the ground)... Just  a horrible watch really. If you don't know the rules or are not strong enough to follow them then you shouldn't be refereeing in my opinion.. Quite possibly the single worst refereeing performance I've ever seen.\n\nEngland's ladies did well to keep their heads and get through the tie. Yes they were sloppy in places and the offside goal showed if Cameroon actually turned up to play and not piss and moan and be dirty then they could have hurt England, but if they aren't actually aware of the rules and how VAR works then they shouldn't be at the tournament.

For the goal you can see how the two can complement each other with Sturridge and Sterling having a perfect understanding of each other\u2019s movement. However, I would have preferred to have a 10 and play Sterling there instead of out-wide where he does become lost. Another mistake although it is hindsight is not playing Vardy. Iceland were playing quite a high line compared to what most people expected. Vardy is deadly this season playing off of a line like this. \n\n\u2022\tHodgson before the game \u201cI\u2019m picking Sterling because we need width\u201d then proceeds to set out the team to not make the most out of the width. I still argue Sturridge is not suited to cutting in from out-wide. He\u2019s best when he\u2019s being played upfront and allowed to drift out-wide to create space. That\u2019s exactly what he did for the goal. I don\u2019t think Kane should have started. His confidence is shot. He does not currently suit this England team as seen in this tournament and his positioning is god awful for England and not what we need. Iceland had so much room in behind them to run against and yet he failed to adapt. Him and Sterling being next to each other was the whole Gerrard and Lampard of this tournament frustrating situation\u2026but a lot, a lot, I mean a lot shitter. Kane and Sterling do not complement each other at all, and just do not work. \n\n\u2022\tHow the teams were set up defensively is a complete opposite of what you could expect and absolute credit to Iceland once again doing their homework and being positive and confident. Normally the \u2018smaller\u2019 team will stand off and not press, but it was England who were the culprits in being tentative.  Iceland were so impressive with their pressing in numbers isolating the wide-men from the rest of the team, which I would also blame on the slow tempo of this English side. By the time our wide players would receive the ball, Iceland were already expertly doubling up. They also set up triangles across the pitch and outplayed us in periods, catching players out of position \n\n\u2022\tI\u2019m still disappointed that our plan B isn\u2019t a change in style, but in fact just throwing all the strikers on the pitch and hoping for something to happen, that isn\u2019t calculated enough for me. Our Plan A wasn\u2019t solid enough either to build a campaign off of. We don\u2019t have the personnel with us to play a 4-3-3. Another tournament of playing players in wrong roles. Sturridge was forced to come deep to create for England, which suited Iceland perfectly. The gap between our midfield and attack was far too large to threaten. Roy got his final sub wrong for us and it proved costly. We already had 3 strikers on the pitch, and instead of going for someone who can create space consistently, he threw everything at the wall. As I called it before, like a 12 year old playing Ultimate Team. Icelands Plan A was absolutely perfect in frustrating us and they did that perfectly. What a compact shape. They\u2019re been managed perfectly and a result against France wouldn\u2019t even be surprising. \n\n\nBit disappointing a lot of disrespect and underestimating that was made towards this side by ITV\u2026it\u2019s why their coverage is shite compared to BBC. Another thing is those clams of their being a \u2018disbelief\u2019 of England going out to Iceland. If this was Liverpool I\u2019d throw my dog out of the window, replace him with a cat and proceed to throw the cat out the window. With England I just laugh. That\u2019s how depressing our National Team has become I can just laugh when we concede against a \u2018lesser\u2019 team. \n"}, {"comment_id": "d4qcoq7", "post_id": "4q5lqk", "comment": "[removed]"}, {"comment_id": "d4qdx8m", "post_id": "4q5lqk", "comment": "Dear Iceland,\n\nPlease destroy France.\n\nRegards,\n\nIreland\n\nEdit: Just at football!

This is because of their transfer ban a few years back.\n\nZidane was brought in to do the impossible and whip up the squad into greatness. They knew that he was a scapegoat until after the ban lifted, where they could once again reinforce the squad. They also understood that the fans wouldn't hate Zidane as he was a legend there and would gracefully accept an awful season with him. Zidane was forced to work with what he had but in exchange he would gain great experience managing at that high of a level. What they didn't expect was for him to actually succeed this much. Fast forward 3 years later and those same players he was forced to work with still remain and Zidane has been given a permanent position as manager. Even now, the club hasn't made any big signings because Zidane was happy with the family he had raised. However his hand is being forced to cut off some of those players in pursuit of new ones. This is to reinforce the squad with new blood as Madrid has always been a club of the \"hottest 11 players of today\" and the fact that many of them have grown old. Another factor is that rivals Barcelona have been splurging none stop, and it shows in the league results. Zidane is the type of manager to offer loyalty in exchange for loyalty. Knowing he can't keep that loyalty anymore and will be forced to get rid of players, I believe he's decided to go instead and let the next manager do the dirty work of telling payers they aren't going to be RM players next season. This is why Bale and Ronaldo had their doubts to began with. Even they knew that many of their players could see an exit this summer, including themselves. \n\nSome evidence that I've seen to back my theory up: same CL starting line up as last year. Not signing a younger keeper to replace Navas. Focusing on developing their own youth players. Giving contracts that secure the future of some players with ~billion dollar buyout clauses.\n\nZidane is the perfect manager. He is the perfect leader. It's sad things had to be this way but that's the nature of it when it comes to a massive club like this. This is why they celebrated this CL cup victory as hard as they did.

It wouldn\u2019t let you down once it started. It was an amazing game of football that had just the right amount of everything every football fan would want from a game. Great chances and chance creation, great goalkeeping, beautiful goals scored, constant going back and forth. It had the perfect amount of everything. First half was great and the game was looking very promising.\n\nIn the late second half the game was going to be decided. Most of goal chances on both sides were being denied by yet again amazing goalkeepers and neither team could convert those chances. There was smell of frustration on the field and it showed \u2013 Real Madrid got to 10 man after an ugly tackle committed on Messi. The emotions are running high - the game is running late, the energy is very high... Right after, Real Madrid scores an equalizer, it\u2019s 2-2 and the game is surely going to end this way. And then we arrive to this moment...\n\nWhat you see in this gif are the last 10 seconds of this game. It was going to be a draw, but fueled with last goal's confidence Real was going for the the win. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Barca attained the ball and moved quickly past the half line, directing the ball right inside the box. There was no foot to kick it but one, waiting for it - perfectly calm, perfectly placing the ball right into the net. Would have that ball been fired a bit softer or a bit harder, it wouldn\u2019t have gotten in. But no, it was just perfect. Astonishing, incredible, unreal - but you're used to it. You look up and it\u2019s him - the only one guy with a shot like that. Right after, the game ends. It is over.\n\nEvery old man, every football fan would say they\u2019ve never seen anyone like him. As the emotions settle down, you know this is the one to remember. I think El Cl\u00e1sico is really an appropriate name for Barca- Real Madrid games. As you witness it you know there\u2019s something chilling about it... \n\nAnd then you realize it - an utter admiration, an awe watching them in their prime time\u2026 Watching the Gods play football."}, {"comment_id": "dgns19v", "post_id": "674k2j", "comment": "My tribute to this goal... http://imgur.com/9UgrNPr"}, {"comment_id": "dgnli7t", "post_id": "674k2j", "comment": "Fuck what a run from Sergi Roberto\n\nMessi is the best.

I realize some players would still be cunts but at least it'd minimize or remove any potential gain.\n\n\nThe clock needs to be stopped whenever the ball is out of play. We currently have a situation where teams and players sometimes set out to waste time from the very first minute of the game. And the crucial point to remember is that most of the timewasting takes place in situations when the ball cannot be contested. It's stupid, annoying as a neutral or as the team on the recieving end and frankly I'd hate to see \"my\" team do it to others aswell.\n\n\nTeams wasting time feign injury and lie down on the pitch for extended periods of time, they have the medical team come on to the pitch 3-4 times per game even though nothing is wrong. They take, literally, 40+ seconds every throw in, corner and freekick. \n\n\nAll of this adds up over the course of 90 minutes and removes lots of time in a sport where the ball already is only in play for about 60 minutes effective time - and that number is an average of all games, which includes games where neither team sets out to do this.\n\n\nThey do this because they know 99.9% of the time the ref only adds 4-5 minutes even though they killed 10+. It infuriates me that this bs is constantly rewarded in our sport when there's an easy solution available.

VAR is just enforcing this handball rule which it is doing correctly. Another rule only the Premier League has put in place this season is that if a linesman thinks a player is offside to raise the flag instantly and not wait for the end of play at which point VAR could look over it like it is done in the rest of Europe (watch the UEFA Super Cup game). If the flag is being raised straight away then if a linesman gets a call wrong and the attacking team ends up scoring a goal they get punished regardless of what VAR decided. I don't know if the idiots at the FAPL did this on purpose to make more dramatic VAR moments to increase controversial calls which result in more clicks, viewership, etc or if these are just unintended consequences but they got it wrong.

On top of that, hockey shots, even the dangerous ones, are not statistical gimmes.\n\nHowever, in the box a deflection like this where a couple key defenders aren't expecting the ball to move basically gives a player a free look from short range on a far larger goal, it's MUCH more needed here.\n\nNow, you could argue that you'd rather have this play be allowed, but as usual for most people's complaints, that is not directly an argument about VAR, it's an argument about whether the ref should simply be the authority (or gets first right of refusal on checking a play, or any level in between)."}, {"comment_id": "exa9h0y", "post_id": "crpw0j", "comment": "I wish the replays were shown without the persuasion of the commentators."}, {"comment_id": "exb3i0o", "post_id": "crpw0j", "comment": "If I can\u2019t enjoy the moment I might as well not watch it live... just read the results later.

One team might get a ref that cards every tackle, the other might allow legs to be broken.  \n\nHowever, I think the rule is better for 2 reasons.  \n\n1. With the addition of VAR technology in the game and more accurate refereeing will only advance and improve over time. I wouldn't be surprised if eventually all cards get reviewed and the ref team works as one unit not a VAR aiding the pitch ref in charge but actually having VAR tell the ref to book or not. \n\n2. If it was unfair that one team got a card happy ref and one didn't in terms of the fair play rule, is not just as unfair they had to play the match with him?

When Eden Hazard tweeted \u201cI have signed for Champions League winners\u201d in 2012, nobody (except maybe few) could have foreseen what the following 7 years would have brought - both the good and the bad. In some ways, he\u2019s emblematic of the club\u2019s decline in reputation. He was oft criticized (most notably in 2014 and 2015) for his weak mentality. He had all the talent in the world but if he had a more aggressive mindset, he could have been as good as Ronaldo and Messi. Gary Neville once openly criticized him on TV after a 2-1 win v West Ham on the opening day. He showed how after about 65-70 minutes, Hazard stopped playing with intensity and Conte was right to sub him off for Michy Batshuayi. It was a fair criticism. Criticism you heard too often from neutrals who watched Hazard on some level of regularity. Our infamous 2015/16 season was marred in controversy and continued failure and in times of despair, our best player had gone missing (which wound up being part injury, part bad form). He only had 3 Champions League knockout stage goals (3 penalties) despite appearing in 12 such matches, we didn\u2019t get past the Round of 16 but one time in those 7 years. No, I\u2019m not saying all of this was his fault. But rather he represents a time in our history where it\u2019s gone sideways. Despite all the talent at his disposal that it could have been so much more.\n\nHe won\u2019t be remembered that way - nor should he. He will be remembered how he carried us to a league title in the latter part of the 14/15 season. At a time where it seemed only our defenders could score goals, Hazard came through in a big way. The match that will forever be indelible in my mind is Villa away in February 2015. We won 2-1 that day. Hazard scored the opening goal 7 minutes in. Villa hit back strongly. We struggled later on in the 1st half. 3 minutes into the second half, Aston Villa level through Okore. We conceded Villa\u2019s first league goal since 20th of December. It was truly a difficult match on this day. But Ivanovic eventually grabbed the winner on minute 66. Hazard didn\u2019t assist that goal but his performance gave us life where there was none to be found. He drove us forward and helped massively in putting us seven points clear of Manchester City - who drew to Hull earlier.\n\nHis efforts in the 16/17 season were massive to help achieve the league for the second time in 3 seasons but this time he had help in N\u2019Golo Kante and an in-form Pedro. The 3-1 victory away at Manchester City that continued our winning run and ensured Manchester City didn\u2019t surpass us in the table. That match won\u2019t only be very fondly remembered by Chelsea supporters, but it is an all-time great Premier League match. Our plan was to hit on the counter and that would not have been possible if Hazard was not there to lead the charge. Either directly or as a distraction for Diego Costa and Willian.\n\nHe\u2019s won every single trophy you can possibly win with exception of the Champions League for which he joined a season too late. Now he\u2019s finally got his dream move at Real Madrid. The downs do not matter today. What matters is what he gave us and the trophies he won. 2x Premier League champion, 2x Europa League winner, League Cup Winner, FA Cup Winner. He came over the same summer as Cesar Azpilicueta and they\u2019re both Chelsea legends. It might be quite sometime before we see this level of talent at Chelsea again. That\u2019s not necessarily an indictment about Chelsea\u2019s current situation but rather proof that his kind of talent is so rare and in 2019, massively difficult to acquire. If Eden Hazard was departing Lille today, they would be pocketing a LOT more than the \u00a330 million we paid (it\u2019s insane how that seems like a bargain today but back then for him was a LOT).\n\nAs he embarks on what will likely be the final chapter of his football career, Eden Hazard has set himself up nicely. He gets his dream move at his dream club to play for his boyhood idol (cue the picture of young Eden Hazard sporting a Zidane France kit). Chelsea Football Club closes this chapter but opens a new one. Hopefully in 7 years, we\u2019re able to reflect on Christian Pulisic in a positive way. This sport can bring about the most unlikely of journeys.\n\nI wish Eden Hazard nothing but the best and while I have long had distaste for Real Madrid as a club, it will be impossible to root against Eden Hazard. I hope he lights La Liga on fire. He won\u2019t be the best player in the league in Spain, but he can at least try and make a claim for 2nd best.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get sad and think the worst. But Chelsea Football Club will be ok. We will move on from this. We always find ways to move on from adversity. I\u2019m excited to see what no Hazard set up looks like.\n\nEdit: Yes I had this pre typed for almost a month lol\n\nEdit 2: Thank you for Gold, stranger! Fun story: January 2016 after a game against Crystal Palace, Hazard was substituted after 16 minutes with an injury. Prior to that injury we were looking lethargic as we had matches prior. I wrote a big self post on this sub after we won that game 3-0 talking about how, as talented as Hazard was, he was hurting us the longer he remained in the starting XI. It came off like a total anti-Hazard post (which was never my intention). I will miss him.
