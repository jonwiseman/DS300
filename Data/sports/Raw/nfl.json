I think the comment I made here was that I had \"mixed feelings\" about it, because at the time, I thought he was just an entitled diva who liked creating drama.  Plenty of guys, particular wideouts, fit that description.  When it was brought to my attention that he threw a bunch of furniture off a roof and almost killed a two-year-old, I said \"Fuck this guy.\"\n\nThen the rape allegation came out, and I was honestly not surprised at how many Patriots fans stepped up to defend him, calling her a golddigger and finding any reason they could to discredit her.  At the same time, we were hearing about him a general asshole to all kinds of people, and I could not for the life of me figure out why people had a hard time believing that someone who was as clearly entitled as Antonio Brown, who surrounds himself with sycophants, treats everyone like shit, always paints himself as the victim, and who clearly receives a steady stream of affirmation for all of the terrible things that he does, would somehow NOT feel entitled to sex whenever he wanted it.  Hey, maybe he didn't do it, but it would certainly be in line with his character of treating others as disposable.\n\nThen you have the SI story, where a woman says that he exposed himself while she was painting a mural.  She didn't file suit, she wasn't going after his money, she just told a reporter her version of events.  All Antonio Brown had to do was shut his mouth, let things play out, and the media would have moved on from it to the next thing that got them clicks.  Instead, he starts texting her pictures of her kids, making fun of her for being poor, implying that she's doing it for money, and including his buddies on the texts so that they can pile on.  What the actual fuck?  *Who does that?*\n\nNo normal person does that.  No person who belongs among society does that.  As I said before, fuck this guy.  I mean, I sincerely hope that he figures it all out and stops being a complete asshole, but it seems as though he's going to learn that lesson the hard way, if he learns it at all."}, {"comment_id": "f0wn5f8", "post_id": "d70fyy", "comment": "Lel"}, {"comment_id": "f0wrn5t", "post_id": "d70fyy", "comment": "Didn\u2019t think anything could unite the historical hate between the Steelers, Raiders, and Patriots.

Well, in medieval times ~~(again, fitting for USC's theme here)~~, there were three types of cavalry horses (destriers, coarsers, and rounceys). Of course, those are classifications and not horse types. The typical horses used were stallions, but mares and geldings were also used by certain groups.\n\nCursory searches don't give me very good estimates on stallions or certain other horse types, so I just turned to [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horses_in_the_United_States). According to that Wikipedia article:\n\n> In 2005, there were about 9 million horses [in the United States].\n\nThat's around double the number of fans that we have, but since I really don't know how many stallions are in the world now, there may not be more chargers out there than Chargers fans.\n\nWe're also part of /r/UngulateTeams and have a horse on our old [alternate logos](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/73/79/fd/7379fda7eb114d9787b512f410f356b2.jpg), so....yeah.\n\nEDIT: some stuff\n\nEDIT 2: I suck at history, I guess"}, {"comment_id": "djcxgln", "post_id": "6jarda", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "djd0omd", "post_id": "6jarda", "comment": ">Buccaneers: There are roughly 2,779,276 Buccaneers fans.

On a last play hail mary the ball got batted around and Gronk who was playing on a bum ankle came up about a foot short of catching it. I think if Gronk is healthy there, and has an extra step off a good ankle he makes that catch 8 times out of 10 the Patriots win another Super Bowl on the back of their second year freak of a tight end and with the rest of his career in perspective Gronk goes down as the best tight end of all time.

I kindof like it but kindof don't.\n\nOn the one hand, this game was won by the defense - and by an all time great, outstanding, incredible defensive performance. Linebacker Derek Brooks won the MVP in Super Bowl 37 and they gave up 21 points that game to the league's #2 offense. This Patriots' team gave up *only 3* to the league's #2 offense and the Patriots' defense was *far* more important to this game than the Buccaneers' was SB 37. If Brooks could win it, then a defensive player really ought to win it here.\n\nOn the other hand, even though the Patriots' offense was unable to put many points on the board in this game, Edelman's incredible performance of keeping the chains moving and maintaining possession played a very large part in keeping the Rams' offense off the field and letting the Patriots' defense stay rested so that they could keep up the pressure and put up the game that they did. In this way, Edelman actually played a major role in keeping that Rams' team at 3 points.\nI would even say this: part of the problem with giving it to a defender is picking which one to give it to. Defense is by necessity so much more consistently a team performance while in offense you can have a standout more easily.\n\nHowever, I think in light of the way he played the entire game PLUS the interception, Gilmore could have been the guy. Up until that point I was saying, \"maybe Edelman or Gronkowski,\" but at that INT I said, \"there you go. Gilmore could be the guy.\"\n\nStill, I think on balance in a 3 point performance like this a defender really ought to win it.

The move clears out millions in salary-cap space for Houston to intensify efforts to sign former Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo, per sources. To be exact, Houston saves $16 million in cash and $10 million against their cap this season. The Texans also will get the Browns\u2019 fourth-round pick this year in exchange for their own 6th-round pick. So Cleveland gets Osweiler\u2019s contract, a 2018 second-round pick and a 2017 sixth-round pick, and Houston gets Cleveland\u2019s 2017 fourth-round pick, saves $10 million in salary-cap space and $16 million in cash. Cleveland is not committed to keeping Osweiler and is likely to try to trade him, per sources. If so, it would turn into a basketball-like trade in which NBA teams routinely trade contracts to get them off their books; only it rarely, if ever, happens in the NFL. It\u2019s hard to remember in the salary-cap era another team when a team traded a contract to get it off its books. But Houston was so anxious to rid itself of Osweiler and move on to its next quarterbacking chapter that it is giving Cleveland extra picks to take him and his contract. The Browns headed into this free-agent signing period with over $100 million worth of salary-cap space and would struggle to spend it all.

However, Andrew would soon come to demonstrate considerable talent for the American style, more brutal, more wild, and more in synch with his own Father's legacy. \n\nHe enrolled at Stanford University, and completed his regimental training quickly while simultaneously studying Architecture, here he developed his trademark Beard whose style now bears his name. While he had no significant War Game wins while a student, his own talent rather than that of his men was not to blame. Thus, he became the First Commanding officer the State of Indiana took since 1998. Commissioned in 2012, Brigadier General Andrew Luck, took command of the 12th Indiana where he would remain his entire career, later that year. He performed well, and managed to demonstrate the talent for battlefield command immediately, His high water mark came in his 2nd Season, Where he went up to face in battle the 12th Massachusetts led by then Major General Thomas Patrick Edward Brady. Gen. Luck was pounded by the ruthless shelling of the Defensive Front, with Secondary Support from the 24th Massachusetts led by Col. Revis. The campaign was lost, though not for lack of trying, simply put General of the Armies William Belichick of the 666th Massachusetts out planned Major General Charles Pagano. \n\nLuck's Career then took a dive over the next few campaigns, not for his skill deteriorating, but due to illnesses, battlefield injuries, and a lack of competence from his superior officers and the Politicians headquartered in Indianapolis. \n\nHe Retired on August 24th, The year of our Lord Two Thousand Nineteen, to much consternation. He stated, he was weary of war, and of the toll the injuries took from him, He praised his men, and those who were lost along the way. He set a shining example for those to follow, and went out like many seminal generals suffering under incompetence from superiors, men such as Col. Calvin Johnson of the 81st Michigan, or Lieutenant General Barry Sanders, the last of the legendary commanders of the 20th Michigan, One cannot forget Lieutenant Colonel Robert Gronkowski, of the 87th Massachusetts, or Major General Jim Brown of the 32nd Ohio.

I didn't have high hopes but I wanted to at least see mediocrity rather than horrendous QB play from guys like Max Hall and Ryan Lindley.\n\n\nTo say that Palmer has exceeded expectations in Arizona would be a huge understatement (at least to me). I just wanted a decent stopgap to make games enjoyable to watch, but the fact that he led our team to the playoffs multiple years and was 2nd in MVP voting in 2015 (absolutely mindblowing in retrospect given our miserable history) was nothing short of incredible.

I understand that the partisan position is to vote to destroy it, but if the conservative view is to keep the economy free, open, and Laissez Faire, then the Republican vote should be to keep Net Neutrality, since it opens avenues for thousands of online businesses who rely on citizens to buy from them. If you care about the well being of the American Economy, you should vote to keep Net Neutrality.\n     The only people that destroying net neutrality benefits are the internet providers, and the politicians that they're paying off. If you are neither of these things, then you should vote to keep Net Neutrality.\n     Not only is this an economic issue, it is an issue of the equality of social classes. In highschool and college more and more homework is done online, and if you have to pay to get certain websites that puts the poorer students at a larger disadvantage than they already have. If you care about the students of America, you should vote to keep Net Neutrality.\n   The vast majority of those in America who know about this issue wish to keep Net Neutrality.

This was the day that personal food and drinks were banned from baseball games. \n\nThe Flyers earned a reputation for brawling a while back. After a fan provoked a St Louis Blues player, he climbed into the stands and started fighting. The Flyers joined in. The rest of the Blues joined in. Fans joined in. The police were called and joined in. A police officer was interviewed *during* this and was quoted saying, \u201cIts the Philadelphia police vs. the St Louis Blues, and we\u2019re winning.\u201d\n\nThe Phillies signed a young African American in the 60s. A fan favorite on the team was a racist and would say derogatory things about having him on the team. He started a fight with him and was then thrown off of the team. The fans blamed the African American player for this event. They brought items to hurl at him for the rest of his career in Philly, most notably batteries, while booing him. He refused to come to games until he was traded to Chicago, where he became the league MVP.\n\nThese are just a few examples. Anyway, Philly fan or not, give it a listen.

Sometimes ticketing managers will work directly with them. I promise you, the Colts have a handful of groups that are buying 300 tickets a season, and are quite happy to guarantee those sales. Some of the biggest owners of seat licenses are these brokers. \n\n\nI was approached by a broker for the license for my dad's tickets to a minor league hockey team a few months after he passed away.

I was kind of hoping to see Smith go to a team that was a QB away though so he'd have some good championship chances.  Redskins, I'm assuming, will be around the same team with Smith instead of Cousins, still a decent team, but not a powerhouse.

I had the same thing happen on Friday night (I work at a high school). Honestly creepy how similar the incidents were (QB hit under the chin, out before hitting the ground) however my athlete is doing well today. A few things about how this gets handled from a medical perspective:\n\n- If the athlete does not regain consciousness after verbal and painful stimuli you spineboard without hesitation. Of course that wasn't the case as he became responsive. \n\n- After the athlete regains consciousness, you do a primary survey for any immediate medical emergencies and to determine how to transport the athlete. In my case, I determined after ruling out medical emergencies like a cervical injury or compromised ABCs (air way, breathing, circulation and severe bleeding) that despite our athlete being unconscious when I got to him initially, he was ok to walk off of the field. To do this, we had him first sit up, then after ensuring nothing changed, had him get on one knee and then stand up. Though our athlete was able to walk without being impaired I still assisted him off of the field. We have a cart I can use, but it was not necessary.\n\nI've had athletes unsteady on their feet walk with assistance off of the field before. That isn't putting them at risk; they're disoriented from an injury that already occurred. Had I thought that it was unsafe I'd have not moved the athlete at all. I work with minors of course so I am naturally more conservative than any NFL ATC, but I would trust that everything was fine to make that decision. Given I believe the diagnosis is that it is a concussion, nothing happened there that put the athlete at risk of further injury. \n\nI wasn't on the sideline for this injury and cannot say for sure anything about what transpired, but helping this guy walk off of the field was not putting him at risk for anything further.

In part I agree with what you're saying. But two years ago we saw a backup QB, on the fringe of retirement, win Super Bowl MVP. It wasn't accidental, at first it was tough going but the coaching staff rallied behind him and worked the offense to his benefit. And he was ready for the playoffs.\n\nIt's a copycat league, and teams seem more invested in their QB depth. I'm a huge fan of this. The NFL is a better league when this is the case, and you could even consider potential long term ramifications. Fact of the matter is, while some QBs deserve what they're paid (Rodgers, Ryan, Wilson, etc), others are paid on the basis of the lack of alternatives. I'm a Dak fan, but even 30M per is steep for what he is now. Yes he's a young Brady between the ears, but his arm talent is closer to Kirk Cousins (who's also overpaid). If massive QB contracts are reserved for the truly special ones, wealth spreads to other areas on the teams and leads to better on-field products. This helps maintain parity in the long run. And it's good for business, fans tune in more when the backup can get it done.\n\nCoaching is coaching, but we're in a golden age of the QB position. And not like the 2011 circus act which saw three 5000 yard passers and none of them were even league MVP. We've got genuine starter quality backups ready to deploy in crisis."}, {"comment_id": "f5lk9qr", "post_id": "dob1gg", "comment": "Coaching matters and so does depth.

Yes, Matt Moore was solid last night.  And he can win in the NFL, he's shown that.  But do the Chiefs win last night if Mahomes is in?  I don't know but it's not like the Pack ran away with the game.  That margin of a better QB might have won it for KC.\n\nIt's similar to baseball's WAR statistic.  With so much parity in the league and with so many games being decided by a one possession score, the marginal benefit of a great QB is really high.  I'd argue that a better QB can net you an extra few wins (again, based on how close most NFL games are) and the difference b/t 8-8 or 10-6 or 11-5 is massive.  So it's not that backups can't play, it's about the marginal value of those elite QB's.\n\nEdit:  and to clarify, I am not disagreeing with OP's point.  I agree.  But a team w/ good coaching / supporting cast and a mediocre but semi-competent QB could still easily go 8-8.  You see it all the time.  So it's not that an elite QB like Drew Brees gives you 11 wins.  You could get 8 of those with an avg. QB.  It's that Brees (just example, insert any good QB here) is the one that tips the scales to get you an EXTRA 3 wins in those close games that you might not otherwise.

That's how important coaching and infrastructure is in the league.\n\nNo. U know why Andy Reid is in KC? He was mediocre for about 3 years in Philly and went 4-12 his last year. Also, how can u be sure of this when we've seen matt Moore start one game in the last 3 years. And talent in the skill positions wasn't the problem. Look at what they did the very next couple of years with Chip Kelly before Kelly went crazy and became the GM. Also look at KC with Smith vs Mahomes. It's night and day. Moore is worse than Smith when healthy. They would likely not be able to get past the wild card round with Moore of they could make it there. If Moore was the QB for KC all of last year, I would bet my life savings that they aren't winning the division or even making the wild card.\n\nThen let's look at the other examples. \nKyle Allen- had one good game against Ari w/o Peterson. He played good his first game and has been a bottom third QB since then. Cam, idk just last year, was way better than Allen when Cam is healthy. If you watched Cam, you realized he sucked cause he couldn't make throws (likely due to injury). He didn't make terrible decisions, he just wasn't physically able to play.  \n\nBridgewater- Is no doubt one of the best 32 QBs in this league. Was passed up on cause of the gruesome injury. Also, we would be singing a different tune about him if the defense and special teams didn't bail him out for the first 2 or 3 weeks. Once he got used to playing QB, he's been playing well because he is a top 32 QB that is also the highest paid backup. The narrative just a month ago was about how bad of QB he is. Also maybe, they had 2 good QBs rather than just one.\n\nBrissett- Again, a top 32 QB. If you think Luck is replaceable because of this, you're crazy Also again, maybe they are both 2 good QBs. Also, stats for the first half are better than what they actually are. I expect him to level off his stats by the end of the year\n\n\nYour also forgetting to mention the nightmare backup QB scenarios as well. Jets backup QB, Steelers with Rudolph, Matt Schaub. All the teams u have mentioned (except the cheifs) have old QBs or injury prone QBs. So it's clear they wanted a backup plan if anything went bad. If the backups played a full season, they would definitely not be as good as the starters. They just have a small sample size and u are overreacting to that small sample size."}, {"comment_id": "f5nfyri", "post_id": "dob1gg", "comment": "Don't forget foles and minschew"}, {"comment_id": "f5nmhwy", "post_id": "dob1gg", "comment": "QBs move the point spread a few points usually, but points spreads are usually within 6 points in the NFL.

I think that this sort of play might get called a bit more often, eventually becoming something of equivalent risk to a deep throw.\n\nEven if defenses would end up adapting to this, it'd be an unstable equilibrium. (What if everyone anticipates the pitch, but Kelce fakes it and spins out of the tackle, turning upfield with the ball?)\n\nOf course, it's easy to rebut my own argument: even an occasional misfire on a lateral would be a huge problem, a turnover caused by an unforced error.
