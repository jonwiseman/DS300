When you back off the temp to the true speed of the piece, it's easy and you can usually play it more accurately since you're used to playing it faster than tempo.\n\nShe always said that when you're to the point where this would help, your fingers already know what to do.

"}, {"comment_id": "c0jozkd", "post_id": "avuyk", "comment": "I'll take a shot at explaining what is to *understand* a scale versus just memorizing it. The key idea in understanding what makes different scales unique is the placement of whole and half steps. Other people have gone over that concept in this thread, but I'll try and explain why it matters. If you play two notes a half step apart, it sounds dissonant, more dissonant than two notes a whole step apart. So, for example, the C major scale goes like this:\n\nC (W) D (W) E (H) F (W) G (W) A (W) B (H) C\n\nWhere I showed you the interval between each note. When people talk about major and minor scales, and even different modes of those, it's all essentially a question of where you put the whole and half steps. The half step intervals in a scale are where our attention is drawn. If you play through the C scale slowly, you'll hear that the E-F transition and the B-C transition stand out the most, in some sense. You could also try playing the C scale, but stopping on B, and you'll hear how it's sort of \"unfinished\", until you hit that last C. For an example of this in practice, play these two chords in a row:\n\nC-F-G\nC-E-G\n\nEven better, if you're on the piano, keep the C and G held down and just move the F to an E. This kind of sound is *extremely* common in music. It sounds very pleasing to us because it goes from C-F-G, a kind of weird chord, to C-E-G, a nice perfect C major triad, by way of a half step. You can get a similar (but different) effect by going from C-D-G to C-E-G. The destination is the same, but this time you took a *whole* step to get there. What if you take advantage of both half-step jumps in the C major scale at once? Play G-B-D-F (called a G7 chord), and then play G-C-E (see how it's still a C major chord, but the notes are in a different order?). See how that went from a kind of dissonant sounding chord to a nice, consonant chord that kind of sounds like \"home\"? In music, we call that a \"resolution\", or say that G7 \"resolves\" to C major. It sounds that way because there were two half-step changes in there: B to C and F to E.\n\nNow, the basic minor scale is a different arrangement of whole and half steps:\n\nA (W) B (H) C (W) D (W) E (H) F (W) G (W) A\n\nThe different placement of the half steps among the whole steps is really what characterizes this as the minor scale, rather than the major scale. It also means that you can't do the exact same things chord-wise as you did with the major scale, because now the half steps, the points of interest, are in different places. For example, if you try to replicate what we did with the G7 above, you'd now be going from E-G-B-D to E-A-C. However, if you look at all the different notes, now there are no half-step resolutions, so the resolution doesn't sound as \"strong\". Because of this, a common change to the minor scale is to make the G a G# instead, so now the scale looks like this:\n\nA (W) B (H) C (W) D (W) E (H) F (minor third) G# (H) A\n\nDon't worry too much about the reference to a minor third, that's just what you call the interval one half step bigger than a whole step. Now, the resolution is E-G#-B-D to E-A-C. However, now the half-step jumps are G# to A and B-C. Notice that the B-C is in a different place on the chord than the F-E was earlier. That's what gives this resolution its minor character rather than major.\n\nBasically, a lot of the \"understanding\" you're looking for will come from finding and exploiting half steps in scales (also a good way to think about writing melodies). In a more general sense, it's about using intervals. A lot of this will just come with lots of practice. Someone else described it as learning your scales to forget them, which is true. By now, I don't think of scales as a bunch of notes, I think of them as the intervals involved, plus some muscle memory. If you asked me to play, say, A major, I'd probably just whip it out based on muscle memory because I'd played it so many times. If you asked for something more arcane though, like Gb melodic minor, I wouldn't do it because I memorized the notes in Gb melodic minor, I would know the sequence of intervals that makes up *any* melodic minor scale, and then I would construct it based off of that. That's the kind of understanding you should strive towards."}, {"comment_id": "c0jnnvh", "post_id": "avuyk", "comment": "What specifically would you like to know?"}, {"comment_id": "c0jnn69", "post_id": "avuyk", "comment": "I'm interested in this too... been playing guitar for years, and relaying on my ears to jam... but I've never had a grasp of proper music theory"}, {"comment_id": "c0jnt5p", "post_id": "avuyk", "comment": "> Simplified theory\n\nIt sounds like you need to learn just that.\n\nStudy and and practice scales and chord theory.

You might think to yourself, \"well, what is it about the G major chord that 'creates tension', that the C major chord does not? they're both major chords, what's the difference?\" and this is fair...\n\n*ACKSHUALLY*, there's not really anything with a G chord - or any major chord, really - that creates tension. Diminished chords and dominant seventh chords create tension because of their tritones. In the context of a major key, the dominant seventh chord rooted on V is interesting and commonly used because \n\n1. all of its pitches appear in the key of the I,\n\n2. it creates tension that can be resolved by going back to the I,\n\n3. it's less dissonant than a diminished chord.\n\nSo in the context of C Major, a G7 chord (G B D F) is entirely composed of pitches in C major and it creates tension because it contains a tritone (B and F), *and it wants to go to C chord* because B leads to C and F leads to E.\n\nPlay any dominant seventh chord and you hear this. C7 makes you want to hear an F. F7 makes you want to hear a Bb. and so on.\n\nI'd argue that an un-seventh'd major V chord only \"wants\" to precede a I because of your ear's expectations and experiences with western harmony/cadences.\n\n---\n\nedit: more elaboration on why 7 chords are great"}, {"comment_id": "eabpxin", "post_id": "9zsp9z", "comment": "I just thought this vid would be useful for anyone curious about how composers use and play with circle of fifths and key changes.

But if your young and you have time to learn then that's fine.\n\nThe basic rule is that each column is a pathway for sound. starting from the input down to the volume slider.\n\nThe input is usually female XLR or female 3.5 mm jack. These are where you plug in the instrument. An XLR lead will usually come from a microphone or a DI box. A 3.5mm (1/4 inch) jack is a standard mono guitar or speaker lead.\n\nThe first pot (potentiometer, better way of saying knob) is almost always Gain. Usually 12 o clock will be 0 Decibels, and this is how you should usually keep it. \n\nYou have an EQ section next, Hi mid low. These control certain frequencies. It is important to know the jargon here. Roll off all or much of the mid and it's Scooped. Roll off all the top and it's bassy, roll off the low and its trebley. Pretty simple really.\n\nSeeing as this is a big desk you might have AUX and Effect. Neither of these are much use to you as a beginner so just keep them at 0.\n\nNow the next bit doesn't make sense if you don't understand 3D Mixing. The principle is simple, you can mix in 3 dimensions by changing the EQ (as mentioned above) panning; reverberance (reverb) and volume, . EQ changes the up and down dimension, so bass is at the bottom and treble is at the top. Panning is left and right. Reverb/volume is forward and backwards \n\nIf it has a built in reverb unit then it is as simple as turning a dial. Things get more complicated (but better quality) if you have outboard effects. Simply speaking, turn up the reverb to make the room you are in sound bigger.  \n\nPanning is usually the second last thing on the column. Panning is simply how far left and right the sound is. Turn to the left it goes left, to the right it goes right, it is incredibly simple but hard to master. Be prepared for subtlety over extreme panning. Pan so the instruments are heard where they are on stage.\n\nThe last is the volume. set this at \u00b10db and usually only cut sound down. I know it sounds weird at first but it makes sense. The figures do not represent actual volume, but difference from the original sound.\n\nThere are a few more controls. One is the stereo out, and that is the final level of the mix. It can be one slider but is often (as seems to be the case with your mixer) two representing left and right.\nHope this helps. And i invite anyone else to go into more depth or correct me on any of these subjects. Happy mixing.   \n"}, {"comment_id": "c33larb", "post_id": "msxis", "comment": "You can learn everything you need to know about how to operate it in a weekend.

I know how a piano goes, but I can't remember whether guitar frets go \"step, step, half step\" or \"half step, half step, step\". Not only that, but it's less intuitive and flat than a keyboard. Still, because of what I've done over the years in my trying to learn guitar (and taking 4 years of classes, I honestly feel kinda like public school failed me - this shit is intuitive and easy) my right hand is significantly more dominant (I like finger picked music, so that's what I taught myself) so I'm finding it hard to use my left hand as an independent instrument basically.

This is why popular music is formulaic and standardized while still marketing itself around a cult of pseudo-individuality. The favored hit singer of the week provides novelty without any significant musical change.\n\nIf you want to hear my perspective as a musician, I do not think that learning music theory alone changes taste in music. I think that being exposed to different styles of music and attempting to learn them inherently increases your ability to appreciate them. I also think that there are many theories of music rather than just one. Hip-hop has its own musical language, and I couldn't compose in that style to save my life. It has its own theory, even if musicians don't sit around describing it in terms of numbers and intervals.

Some days, you want to set aside some time and really digest a $100 steak [big symphony], savoring every nuance and flavor. Other days, maybe you're short on time or really stressed and you just need to have a cheap, simple, and satisfying burger [pop music].

You don't suddenly appreciate computers less by learning about how they work. Instead, learning about them is enlightening and allows you to both appreciate and understand more.\n\nToo often, people explain that you \"should\" like a form of music because of some highly technical reason. And that's condescending. You don't have to like anything. And there are plenty of well-educated musicians for whom Keith Jarrett is just not their taste, too.\n\nMusic contains two distinct \"arts\": the composition and the performance. The performance part is what interests you. After all, that's the end product that makes music worthwhile in the first place.\n\nHowever, the composition part is quite an art, too. A skilled composer often likes the intellectual stimulation of writing out an abstract idea. A skilled producer likes tending to subtle changes in a song's instruments and form. A skilled improviser likes realizing whatever artistic whim runs through his (or her) head. It's just like a writer who appreciates a creative grammatical construction or a painter who tries holding a brush in a new way. Or, to stick with my original analogy, it's like the people who design websites, computers, and video games. These may (and usually do) go unnoticed by the person experiencing the art, but that doesn't mean they don't contain artistic value. Sometimes the value is only to the composer, and that's fine.\n\nLearning more about music theory is not obstructing. Instead, it opens up a new dimension to the art. It allows you to appreciate the finer details of creating music--details that may be virtually invisible to the non-musician. Your piano teacher probably likes both Coldplay and Keith Jarrett.

I know there are counterexamples, and maybe those are what would make the discussion interesting, but it seems like the vast majority of radio friendly music follows maybe 5 or so chord progressions, and rarely strays outside of a few keys.\n\nI don't think adding complexity necessarily creates a sound that takes more education to appreciate.  I suspect it has more to do with the listener's personality: how curious are you?  How much do you appreciate something new for the sake of it versus sticking with something you're comfortable with?  Someone who likes new stuff just because it's new might really like unique harmonies and melodies even if they couldn't describe what's different about them.\n\nThe same thing happens with movies, where certain people like challenging films and a somewhat distinct group likes blockbusters.

Letter mnemonics are English-specific - in another language, they'll be totally arbitrary. Standard notation isn't bound to any language or geographical region.\n\n3.

Accidentals are confusing and inconsistent, at least in their example. In the left hand: the A's at the beginning are unmarked, but supposed to be natural. So we assume that no marking means \"follow the key\", but then the B at the top is unmarked, and it's supposed to be flat. And it seems that they've ditched key signatures and are just marking all the accidentals (see the repeated Ab in beats 3 and 4, first measure, left hand), which will lead to a huge amount of redundant symbols.\n\n5. It's not clear in their notation how or why to interpret the beamed notes in the first measure LH as 16th notes. The line with an arrow doesn't really resemble their symbol for 16th notes.\n\n6.

Some keyboards actually have automatic chords, where if you play the notes of the chord, the keyboard recognizes which chord you're playing and fills in the instruments or changes the key of the backing.

Also, you are getting derped by a bunch of the members of /learnmusic/ who don't have a good understanding of modes right now.  It's hard to blame them, because it took me about 4 or 5 years before I properly understood them myself.  \n\nA mode is a set of pitches just like any other scale.  We can arrive at the most basic ones by using a different degree of the major scale as a root.    Each one has it's own specific character to it.  \n\nWhen referring to modes, C major is not the same as D dorian, because they aren't using the same root (among other reasons).  The best exercise I can recommend to familiarize yourself it to put on a drone (C for instance) and then play every parallel mode of C (C major, dorian, phrygian, lydian, mixolydian, aeolian, locrian.)\n\nI recommend playing them in order of Lydian, Ionian, Mixolydian, Dorian, Aeolian, Phrygian and finally Locrian.  Notice how only one pitch changes between each mode.  Each changed pitch is the \"characteristic tone\" of the mode, or what sets it apart from other modes.  When improvising over the drone, make sure your phrases emphasize the characteristic note, because otherwise it's extremely hard to establish what mode you are in.  \n\nModes do NOT have progressions.  It's impossible to progress in a mode because any sense of a dominant tonality will destroy modality.  Modes are better defined as a wash of harmony that moves between chords without ANY strong feel or need to resolve.  Until you have a very strong understanding of how modes function, it's best to just use them over pedals or vamps.\n\nIf you are looking for some distinctly modal music, I have a few recommendations.  \nDorian - \"So What\" by Miles Davis\n\nPhrygian - \"Meeting of the Spirits\" by Mahavishnu Orchestra (the first vamp in 6/8 establishes a strong phrygian feel)\n\nLydian - \"Jungle Fiction\" by John Scofield (Although he is toying with the listener by using two lydian modes a minor third apart)\n\nMixolydian - \"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\" by Michael Jackson\n\n\nI only listed those modes because Ionian is the major scale, and Aeolian is minor.  Locrian is not used as a tonic mode.  It can be used as a chordscale for harmonization but there is no music written in locrian aside from experimental compositions, as it is a tonic diminished sound that will retonicize as soon as either minor or major tonality is introduced.\n"}, {"comment_id": "c1fwc73", "post_id": "fh49d", "comment": "When they say that you are starting on a different note, the mean that you don't change the pattern of whole and half steps that you have been using.

It has a different feel from the standard mode because the order of the step sizes changes, each order having its own unique characteristics."}, {"comment_id": "c1fwej6", "post_id": "fh49d", "comment": "D dorian is not derived from the C major scale; it has the same key signature, but is not the same scale. The site you were looking at is a little confusing because it uses the term 'C Major' to mean both the key and the scale. Playing a C major scale from D to D doesn't make sense because that is a Dorian scale; playing from D to D in the **key** of C major is a much better way to say it. By the way, the major and minor scales are modes as well (Ionian and Aeolian, respectively), which may help you understand that you can't derive a Dorian mode from either a major or a minor key."}, {"comment_id": "c1fzdde", "post_id": "fh49d", "comment": "Some motherfucking kickass redditor taught me this:\r\n\r\n**I** **D**on't **P**articularly  **L**ike **M**odes **A** **L**ot.\r\n\r\nIonian Dorian Phrygian Lydian Mixolydian Aolian Locrain\r\n\r\nNot helpful for the sounds but helpful for remembering the damned names in order.  ; )"}, {"comment_id": "c1fwv3z", "post_id": "fh49d", "comment": "I like to think of modes as only things that work with melodies, not harmonies.  I've never heard of a chord progression in E dorian.  You usually just pick what key is closest and work from there.\n\nFor instance, you'd probably say that \"Eleanor Rigby\" by the Beatles is in the key of e minor, but with all of the C#s in the melody, it sounds dorian to me.\n\nThe whole thing about starting with a different root note is just a way to teach kids the whole/half steps in between the notes of the real scale.  Has nothing to do with the modes themselves, really.  But the fact they have a different tonic is key."}, {"comment_id": "c1fx074", "post_id": "fh49d", "comment": "Another way to think of the modes is to start with a major scale and just keep adding flats to the key signature. First you get C ionian, then mixolydian, then dorian, then aeolian, then phrygian, then locrian. If you go the other way by adding sharps you just get lydian and that's it. In general, the more flats a mode has the \"darker\" it sounds, the more sharps it has the \"brighter\" it sounds."}, {"comment_id": "c1fxala", "post_id": "fh49d", "comment": "someone else posted this before.
