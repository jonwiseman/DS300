The trick is though, you have to leave one finger on the screen after zooming in and while screenshotting. If you slip up the ads and other shit will wreak havoc on your mobile device.

So we all went up there on one of our breaks and the dude was so fucking cool and so jacked to show is all the shit he\u2019s worked on over the years. \n\nHe converts tapes to digital files. One of the many records he converted was Zeppelin II. If you\u2019ve ever listened to that record digitally in literally any way, you have him to thank. \n\nAs we were all gazing around the room at all the amazing shit he\u2019s been involved with, he asked \u201cyou guys wanna hear what I\u2019m workin on now?!\u201d \n\nLike we\u2019re gonna say no to that right? \n\nSo he rewinds a bit and says \u201clemme get back to this one spot I know you guys will love\u201d then presses play... and Jimi goddamn Hendrix starts playing and singing on some jam and is ripping some solo... \n\nWe\u2019re all legit looking at each other wide eyed knowing that this has probably only ever been heard by just the crew that tracked plus a couple others... my buddy who is a huge Jimi fan had tears in his eyes. \n\nSo Jimi is slaying and we\u2019re taking it all in when all the sudden during his solo you hear a little whiff followed by \u201cAhh fuckin hell I broke a string\u201d and we all lose our shit hahaha. \n\nThe guy was so excited to share that with us and we were so honored to experience it with him and together. What a job that guy has.

Also the shroom trip was great and I wrote two songs haha.\n\nEdit 2: The guy that showed us the tapes is named Dan Johnson (@dan_audioarchiving on Instagram) for anyone interested. I wrote him and asked where/how to hear the sessions and he replied: \n\n\u201cHey Josh!  Thanks for the kind words.  I do remember you, and I'm glad you liked the tour.

I write everything in Guitar Pro for a reason.)\n\nI also aggressively adblock that site, so it's possible that's blocking some of the more obnoxious messaging. Can you link to any of the affected tabs you've found? I'm curious to see if there are any tells so I can anticipate if any of my tabs are next.\n\nFWIW, I upload all my tabs (Guitar Pro only \u2013 I don't do text tabs) to Ultimate Guitar (and nowhere else) for a few reasons:\n\n1. It's (AFAIK) where they'll get the most eyes. I think UG still has a much bigger userbase than Songsterr and other tab sites.\n2. I get credit for my submissions. All my tabs are fairly visibly attributed to me, whereas it's pretty buried in Songsterr.\n3. I can choose to prevent edits to my tabs. I got into uploading my transcriptions because I was dissatisfied (to put it lightly) with the horrendous Guitar Pro tabs on the interwebz. The last thing I want to do is cede editorial power to the same randos that were the reason I got into making tabs in the first place. Songsterr is all about being a \"wiki\" of guitar tabs, so they're always editable. Considering how subjective ear training can be, there is no way in hell I trust that given enough edits, people, and time, we will converge on \"the truth\" in a guitar tab. TL;DR I don't like Songsterr's edit model.\n4. Ultimate Guitar lets you download the source Guitar Pro files, which are the **only** way I recommend anyone use my tabs because all of the browser tab players out there are terrible. AFAIK you can't download Guitar Pro files from Songsterr at all.\n\nIf any of these things were to change, I'd look elsewhere for a tab host in a heartbeat."}, {"comment_id": "eibjvvb", "post_id": "b00xdr", "comment": "Ultimate Guitar is a scumbag app."}, {"comment_id": "eibkv25", "post_id": "b00xdr", "comment": "I paid for a year of the pro service last year and it\u2019s running out shortly.

Depending on the value of the pedal, the trade off might be worth it."}, {"comment_id": "d4icby2", "post_id": "4p24i2", "comment": "No, nothing to worry about, won't hurt anything. Regardless of what effects you plug in, it's still the same analog signal that gets sent to the amplifier.  You can see this with a voltmeter if you're interested. Hook the leads to the patch cable that you'd normally plug into the jack on the amp, and experiment. It's just an analog signal until it hits the amplifier, nothing more. At least not with any effects pedal I've ever used (distortion, flanger, chorus, echo, etc). Most of the distortion pedals work by overdriving the signal with their own internal circuitry that causes the signal to sort of \"square\" off the top/bottom of the amplitude, which is what makes it sound fuzzy and distorted, but the signal going to the amp doesn't increase in voltage or anything like that.  I'm an engineer, but this isn't my area of expertise, so my apologies if the details are a bit off. Again - check it with a voltmeter. Touch one lead to the tip, the other to the shaft below the collar, and set it to DC. You may see a slight variance due to added resistance when you turn pedals on and off, but it should stay relatively the same.  I have an old tube head that I've been using since the 80's, never had an issue, have never had to replace any tubes (mine uses GE-6L6's). I do notice differences in sound when changing the order of the pedals. For example, I like to put my distortion in front of an old analog Morley wah-wah. It just sounds better when it's in front as opposed to behind.  That's probably because the wah-wah is from the 70's and 100% analog. Most stuff these days are digital. The old wah-wah is essentially a tone pot with a light-absorbing potentiometer. There's a flap of black felt that covers or uncovers its lens as you operate the pedal. That in turn operates the tone lot. Pretty ingenious, really.

I use 12 gauge on my working guitars and 13's on my practice stuff. What I mean by move the top (if you don't know) is the soundboard. The top of your acoustic is a soundboard. The strings vibrate the board and the vibrations are amplified in the chamber by the board. If you strings are too light it'll take more effort to get the top \"moving\" or vibrating in a way that produces a round tone. \n\nNext, learn 5 chords. C A G E D (learn the G with your pinky on the G and ring on the D, it just sounds better). Practice switching between them, making sure not to lift your fingers off the board more than you need to. In other words, don't let your fingers fly up in the air when you switch chords. Its VITAL that you practice this way from  the very start.

Notice how on your left leg that your left arm has so much more agility and freedom of movement. Maybe that wouldn't matter to you because of your physical characteristics, but for most people, they are going to feel less stress if they place it on their left leg instead of their right while sitting. \n\nNext, notice how much more power you have in your fingers if they are placed perpendicular to the guitar. You don't want to hit the the strings at an angle, it creates wasted energy. \n\nAlso, think long and hard about how you want to hold your pick the rest of your life. Most people will hold the fattest part and apply the pointy part to the strings. Is that the best way for you? Experiment with holding the pick sideways and hitting the strings with the round/fat part and see if it makes playing faster and see how it changes the tone when there is more pick in contact with the strings. The less the pick digs in between the strings, the quicker you can be running fast-picking leads. \n\nAlso, think about picking technique. Some great teachers recommend *always* alternating pick strokes; others say that you alternate except when you change strings in which case you want to pick in the direction of the new string. So, going down from, say, the G string to the B string you would use a downward stroke. \n\nAs far as standing posture goes, notice that the higher you hold the guitar, the easier it is to get around the neck. That's why you see so many hipsters rejecting the rock-n-roll stance of keeping the guitar as low as possible. Yes, it does look more cool, but it limits your speed. Of course, longer arms is going to mean more comfort and ease when you wear it low, but it's still a trade-off between looking cool and utilizing better technique. \n\nedit: grammar/typos"}, {"comment_id": "cjo9nt1", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Just start definitely definitely."}, {"comment_id": "cjo9t9n", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "hahaha this is great"}, {"comment_id": "cjoc3e8", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Esteban guitars are considered autistic, right?"}, {"comment_id": "cjodlco", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "1) You have friends who play guitar, no? Have them check out your instrument and see is it needs work. It's usually not much, some filing on the bridge or nut, and perhaps a neck adjustment. However, I've seen many guitars that cannot play well because the bridge is in the wrong location. You can tune it fine, but if the bridge is too close to the nut, notes further up the neck will sound sharp, too far away and they will sound flat. I worked in a music store back in the day, and a guy brought in these beautiful expensive looking instruments, at a very low cost, but we turned him away because the bridges were placed wrong. \n\n2) New strings. Strings that have gunk on them or have blackened will not vibrate evenly, and you will not get good intonation. You'll want a combo peg winder and pin puller to change strings. I got one that also has a string cutter built in. It's worth it.\n\n3) Tuner. The clip on tuners are okay, but you'll become a much better player if you learn to tune trusting your ears for the final adjustments. Even a well formed chord can sound wrong if your tuning is off. You should be able to do E and A forms up the neck (3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th frets, for example) and have it sound good.\n\n4) Now the good news is that there's a ton of free TABs available online, and chord charts, and videos that will help you learn, in just about any style that might appeal.\n\n5) Now the bad news. It's a lot of work, and your fingers will hurt. A lot. You'll learn to like that.\n\n6) Learn songs. THE WHOLE SONG, EVERY TIME. Not just the fun bits. Not just the bits that are easy to play, but sound cool. Learn the whole dang song. This will make jamming with other folks a lot more fun. (Oh -  and sing if you've got it.)\n\n7) If you start to loose interest, shake it up. Get a capo and explore with it on the 3rd Fret. (Lots of Jethro Tull 'round there, but Mother Goose is on the 5th. You'll find John Barleycorn on the 7th, with Hotel California)\n\n8) If that gets old, try alternate tunings. It's a great way to teach you fingers NOT to automatically go for the standard chord forms.\n\nHave fun."}, {"comment_id": "cjodzys", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Well, I'm way too late for the easy joke, aren't I?"}, {"comment_id": "cjog15c", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Justinguitar is easilly the best I've found.

Pick 2-3 songs from your favorite artist. Go to a website like [Ultimate Guitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/), [Songsterr](http://www.songsterr.com/), or if you're lucky, a band-specific tablature website made by a fan, and get the tabs for those songs.\n\n2. Pick a song and practice it piece by piece. Start with the intro, practice that until you get it down, then start on the verse. Once you learn the verse, go back to the intro to make sure you still got it, then work on transitioning from intro to verse. Once you have that, learn the chorus and go back to the verse, etc.\n\n3. Move on to the next song and do the same thing, and go back to the first song every now and then until you get comfortable with both.\n\n4. Repeat process with 3rd song, throwing in the first two when you get bored with practicing it.\n\n5. Add more songs as proficiency grows.\n\nThis is how I learned. Make sure you bookmark your sources too. It's really handy to have your songs bookmarked for quick reference for when you get stuck and need a reminder. This process is going to be frustrating, but if you really want to learn guitar, you'll trudge through it. Also, don't judge your progress based on other's ability. The natural state of a guitar player is thinking that everyone else is better than they are. Use that as a motivation to learn. Music is a language, and not everyone learns to speak at the same time or the same way. As you get more proficient, you'll start to see repeating patterns in music, things \"that sound like this\" and other sounds that will become second nature.\n\nI also highly recommend investing in a tuner, or watch a couple youtube videos about learning to tune your guitar. Intonation was the bane of my existence when I first started learning guitar, because I would often spend more time trying to tune the damn thing than practicing. Once I learned the proper way to do it, it only takes a short time to get practicing again."}, {"comment_id": "cjod7a8", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": ">autistic guitar\n\nI just about pissed myself"}, {"comment_id": "cjoe05i", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "autistic lol\n"}, {"comment_id": "cjoe3r5", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": ">ffs I know it's acoustic, auto correct is fucking me in the ass.\n\nVideo or it never happened.\n\nI believe that there is *or was* a /u/Shitty_Watercolour *in there...*"}, {"comment_id": "cjoenj2", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Your friends will never live that typo down when they see this post."}, {"comment_id": "cjoeq3h", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Eadgbe "}, {"comment_id": "cjoevwo", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "YouTube stuff like \"how to play guitar\" \"guitar for beginners\" etc. This is how I learn to do just about everything."}, {"comment_id": "cjof4on", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Marty Shwartz on youtube.com He is a excellent teacher."}, {"comment_id": "cjofhgl", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "Begin at 4chan, specifically /B/"}, {"comment_id": "cjofhkv", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "You should really give that autistic kid his guitar back."}, {"comment_id": "cjofis2", "post_id": "2dbw15", "comment": "geez dude. just delete and repost haha.  \n  \nchords, definitely chords.

Only \"fret\" (press down on a string) with your finger tip, so you don't accidentally mute a surrounding string.  \n  \nPractice switching between chords.

Not getting enough pressure on the bar is usually the biggest challenge.  \n  \nLearn how to do power chords.  play seven nation army.  \n  \nlearn to mute your strings.  \n  \npractice alternate strumming patterns and rhythms.\n  \nNow you know your chords, go look up tabs on ultimate-guitar.com - start with easier songs, but songs that you like. Play along. Sing too, be able to play a few songs on your own. Play for your friends or mom.  \n  \nKeep playing scales. Learn some new ones.

Do this often, even without a backing track.

Taylor Swift is her obvious inspiration, as 4 of every 5 songs I hear her play are by her. Don't care for that particular music, but whatever gets her to play and put herself on instagram with her passion is fine by me!\n\nI do feel like there's a downward trend in the number of overall guitar players; some people laying down the axe over the years doesn't help of course. And it's anecdotal but very few people my age (30) in my social circle seem to be involved in making music in any way except for a few ladies who fancy singing and a couplke of amateur DJ's.\n\nI do think this \"news\" is more of a PR move by Fender than any kind of serious data. Being \"inclusive\" as a company is hip nowadays and it feels like they're jumping the bandwagon by reporting a statistic with zero actual definition or transparancy and with no way to verify or deduce a trend. Even if this statistic were accurate it's in no way indicative of anything on its own.\n\nI also dislike the implied notion of inequality based on prejudice. A handful of guitar acts that have ladies in them have won prices has not resulted in total gender equality amongst overall live acts and festival line-ups?

It's affected my family badly these past two years.. The other family member was on my step mothers side who had it. Been rough the past couple years. To hear your story makes me happy though as from a person who has had people in my family who have died from it, I'm glad that you beat cancer.  I don't blame you for buying your dream guitar as we only really live so long so it's better to enjoy it and make the most of life. I recently bought an SG as well and love it. I like yours more its a very nice guitar. Hope you enjoy it and that you don't have to deal with cancer anymore. It has affected so many and I'm glad to hear you beat it. Also happy to see you bought your dream guitar. You deserve it for dealing with what you had to."}, {"comment_id": "e3ersdz", "post_id": "93iyom", "comment": "Love this.

A simple example of this is an A chord played within the first two frets vs played as a bar chord from the 5th fret. Another is the D chord triad (with the addition of the open D string, usually) compared to the bar from the 5th fret, starting on the 5th (A) string, which has the same shape as the regular A chord.\n\nAlso, the way the notes sound will be slightly different even though they are the same pitch. There are two main reasons for this, I think. The first would probably be how it resonates, and usually the open string will resonate longer and be less muted. The second reason could be the size and thickness of the string. Not too sure about that, though.\n\nFinally, it can be a thing of convenience. For example, a B note on the 6th string (7th fret) is technically the same as the B note on the 5th string (2nd fret) but if you are wanting to hit the F# (2nd string, 7th fret) or a similarly high note right after that B, then you're going to struggle much more using the B on the 5th string, 2nd fret. The same goes for if you want that F# at the same time as the B, or as part of a chord with those two notes (for example, a B bar chord) and that takes us back to chord voicings."}, {"comment_id": "dkflahf", "post_id": "6o7hjl", "comment": "Theyre the same note. you can use them interchangeably, just find which not is easier or more comfortable in the riff or whatever it is. \n\nNote that because of the difference in string length of each note (the length from bridge to 5th fret is shorter than the length of the whole open A string) and thickness of each string, they will probably have a different sound quality. For example: I find the open A sounds a bit brighter and has a slightly different tamber than the 5th fret low E string. This is usually a very small difference, but it is noticable, especially when you go to extreme differences and play an open D string and compare it to the 10th fret on the low E string; theyre the same pitch, but have different attack and tonal qualities."}, {"comment_id": "dkfmnn2", "post_id": "6o7hjl", "comment": "You can, but they're gonna sound a little different.

All the above advice is great advice.  Listen to it. \n\n2.  If you want to play music, seriously consider blazing through school and getting a decent paying non-music job so you can actually afford to do music.  Coding is a great choice if you like that sort of thing.  \n\n3.  Consider longevity.  It is rare to have a music career for life.  The late night gigs, hauling gear, frequent travel, and low income make it hard to do between ages of 30-70.   You'll miss your family, your kids, and you'll probably be relatively poor.  \n\n4.  Consider the alternatives.   After 10 years in music, I changed careers and went to med school.  In a few years, I'll be able to hire my own cheap roadie when I play out, the best equipment, and as much time off as I could want to gig.  Also, I've found music becomes a LOT more fun when the pressure to make a sellable product is gone. \n\nAgain, these are just my experiences, and I'm not saying people shouldn't pursue music careers.

Totally agree on the play music not exercises part. Exercises have their place, but you'll never learn to make music if you don't play music. I think exercises have their place, but too much emphasis on those can be bad.\n\nMusic is a language. It can be written, it can be read, and it can be spoken. For me personally, I can read music about as well as a 4 or 5 year old reads English. It's more important to me to speak it. Scales and exercises are like learning the ABC's and the different phonetic sounds. They're the basics, but I'll never be able to write an epic novel like Moby Dick only reciting the ABC's or pronouncing the phonetic sounds. \n\nA writer writes an epic by writing short stories. Improving each time. Becoming more engaging. Stories get longer and better until he writes a great story.\n\nGuitar is similar. Write a riff. Write a better riff. Put a few good riffs together. Make a song. Now write a better song. ad nauseam until you hit gold.\n\nWant to know how to play what you hear? Expand your \"vocabulary.\" When I was a baby, I said \"mama,\" \"dada,\" and \"baba.\" Mimicking the words I heard others say.

I took a luthiery course last year and the instructor said the best guitar he ever heard was a cheap Squier Strat. He was astonished, but for whatever reason it just sounded amazing. On the other end of the spectrum, I personally have owned $2500 guitars that sounded thin and had no mojo. \n\nIt IS important to have a functioning guitar (e.g., stays in tune, intonates well, pickup selector works, etc.).

One great reason for taking lessons. Many self taught players learn the hard way or give up because of bad tuning.\n\nThere is someone right now somewhere giving up on guitar saying, \"I suck. This sounds like crap...\" and in their frustration and self doubt forget to check their tuning, \n\nKnowing how to properly tune a guitar is an essential part of learning to play. \n\nEveryone starting to learn guitar and stringed instruments should find some professional tutorial or advice on this. For instance, tune down then up to proper pitch. Know how to tune a guitar without a tuner, only a one reference tone and then each string from that properly tuned one. Make sure to fully stretch new strings, etc. Always be mindful of your tuning. Does a note or chord sound funny because you are fingering it wrong, or is it the tuning? \n\nWhen playing electric guitar, especially if you play hard, your gonna go out of tune. Some day you will have to learn to not only hear the bad string, but tune it on the fly. \nBut for staters you have to always be in tune, or else you'll not know if you're fingering the chord wrong or if some string is out of tune.  \n\nI've come across several people who were giving up in frustration trying to learn guitar only to find out they were trying to play poorly tuned guitars. This is one reason acoustic guitars are considered better by some people as the best guitar to learn on, you don't have to constantly retune them. \n\n*Having a properly tuned and intonated guitar is the only way to learn.* \n \nOnce you get the hang of fine tuning, you'll start to realize that guitars do not have perfect intonation.

Just stop. That Squier Strat you have? Sounds fine. The Roland Cubie100dollar thingy majig amp? Sounds great too. Sure it isn't a Mesa Boogie or a 1956 Les Paul but it is 6 playable strings with pickups. Your gear isn't going to make you a good player. YOU ARE! I've seen famous guitar players make a Squier sound like any vintage holy grail way more expensive than it should be guitar or better.\n\nI actually disagree here (and I kind of hate to). Better equipment will always make you sound better and it'll make you want to practise more. No one wants to go up and down scales if they've got shite tone and a guitar that's uncomfortable to play. You should always be looking for quality. Jimi Hendrix didn't play a crap guitar because he didn't think it mattered, he played it because that was his sound. It certainly isn't the most important thing but in my experience it has mattered a great deal. It's a bitter pill to swallow but yeah. \n\n> Play music, not mindless exercises. People will argue with me on this one, and that's fine, but this is my personal mantra. Learn songs you want to play, the harder for you to learn the better. Don't stand in your room like a tool for 6 hours running over some finger exercises you saw some long haired dude on youtube say is the only way to learn how to play fast or better or what have you. Play music, that's the whole point of guitar. Music. Practice music, don't practice hitting a string with a piece of plastic.\n\nTotally disagree. You would never become a great football player if you just played football in the park with your friends instead of drilling. It doesn't necessarily have to be mindless but just learning songs that get progressively harder is very inefficient. If you want to play difficult music you have to do those exercises for long periods of time. They're not everything by any means but dedicating a quarter of your practice time to them is very beneficial. \n\n> Song writing is everything. You want to be a great guitarist? Awesome. If you want to be a guy that sits in his room and covers other peoples music and jams to some progressions that is sweet man, and I'm not taking anything from that, BUT, if you want to make it as a gigging musician: Song writing. Far more important than guitar playing. You must practice song writing just like you do guitar playing. But it branches out, you don't need to write catchy songs with Chords and lyrics, start simple and write catchy guitar riffs. I stand by this statement because its true for me: One painfully stupid and simple guitar line can literally take you around the world.\n\nJust not true. Covers bands, musicals etc. all need guitarists who will play the songs that are already written. Improvising is not songwriting either. I'm not really sure what you're talking about here. I've played plenty of gigs (even some pretty large-scale musicals) that didn't require me to write shit. Again, I'm not saying song-writing isn't important but it's *so* not everything. My song-writing didn't put me in front of hundreds of people per night at a fairly well-known theatre. \n\nI get that it's your take on it but I think it's very close-minded and actually, not great advice (only the bits I replied to, everything else is true)."}, {"comment_id": "cey2cb5", "post_id": "1w2873", "comment": "\"About Greg Koch:\nAn unsung guitar hero from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, where he grew up just a few miles from the Waukesha birthplace of the late, great guitarist-inventor Les Paul, Greg Koch has established himself within six-string circles as a masterful technician, accomplished clinician (for Fender) and general bad-ass guit-picker.

Sure it isn't a Mesa Boogie or a 1956 Les Paul but it is 6 playable strings with pickups. Your gear isn't going to make you a good player. YOU ARE! I've seen famous guitar players make a Squier sound like any vintage holy grail way more expensive than it should be guitar or better.\n\n> Buying a nice guitar is all fine and well, but don't stress out about it. You don't NEED an amazing guitar. Jimi Hendrix would sound like Jimi Hendrix through a plywood strat copy and a Fender frontman on its last leg.\n\n  I think that this is a common mindset but not one that is really honest, sure, you don't need a $4000 PRS Private stock guitar to be good but you need a guitar that you like, that you can count on and that inspires you.\n\n  Granted, a Squier or a Epiphone are fine, there is nothing wrong with them, one can even gig with them just fine (though they will probably not handle the road as well) but to say that gear means nothing? I don't know if that is accurate for everyone.\n\n  You use Hendrix as a example, saying that he could play anything and still sound like Hendrix, do you really believe that? I mean, do you think he can make a plywood Squier with a Fender frontman amp sound like his 60's era Strat's and flying V's through Marshall's?\n\n  You are right, good gear does not make a good player, that is not up for debate, only practice and learning can make you a better player.\n\n  With that being said, good gear counts for something, it does not have to be amazing but there is a \"sweet spot\" where the gear you get actually helps inspire you, a good guitar that feels great and is exactly what the player wants is the guitar that will encourage them to pick it up.\n\n  For some folks, cheap Squier's are good enough to do that, for others, they are not, that does not make them \"elitist cork sniffers\" or \"Lawyers/Doctors who act like guitarists\", it just means that everyone has different standards, for me, I like the feel and specific feature set of a American Standard Stratocaster plugged straight into a multi-channel tube amp, does that mean I worry more about gear than skill? No, it just means I have a specific type of guitar that inspires me and if that means I pick up the guitar more often to play and explore music, it is doing it's job perfectly and no other guitar is better suited.\n\n  To be blunt, if you watch footage of a guy like Big Bill Broonzy, you will see that even he is playing a Martin acoustic, Chuck Berry played Gibson's and Buddy Guy made a name for himself in the public eye with a Fender Stratocaster, nobody ever told them that they spent too much or got gear that was beyond their level or need.\n\n  I don't mean to jump on you about this but I think a lot of folks say \"gear does not matter\" without really considering that for some folks, it actually does and in the end, they don't need to justify it, they don't need to prove anything to deserve to use it.\n\n  Another quick thing on this topic to think about, I had a few cheap guitars before I ended up getting my first USA made Stratocaster, I connected to that strat in a more concrete way because I knew it was something special, it was something that I had always wanted but it took me a long time to get there, in the end, that led to that guitar being very special to me, just picking it up made me feel proud and satisfied, I knew that I something that meant a lot to me and the work involved in affording it (I was a teenager at the time) made that connection even greater.\n\n  That was not imaginary, a better guitar really did inspire me to be a better player.\n\n  Other than that one point, I agree with much of what you have said, I perhaps have a different philosophy when it comes to learning (I learned only recently that I should have done theory first and foremost as it makes everything easier later in terms of not only creativity but also collaboration with other musicians) but in the end, I agree with your overall approach.\n\n  "}, {"comment_id": "ceychga", "post_id": "1w2873", "comment": "This please, a million times.

This one hits me harder than basically any I've experienced in my lifetime.\n\nMalcolm Young (along with Angus), were my favourite guitar players ever. AC/DC is, and will always be, my favourite band. Before I was twelve years old, I didn't know anything about rock music. Then there was that big Sars concert out in Toronto. I watched it on TV and watching AC/DC blew my fucking mind. It actually changed my life. Those were the guys who made me beg my parents for a guitar. Of course, when you're a kid, it's Angus running around like madman that really draws you. As I got older, I really appreciated what Malcolm was doing.\n\nBest right hand (both as a right hand man, and a literal right hand) in rock and roll. Angus would play these ten minute long solos, but Malcolm would never ever lose time. He was a human metronome. I've seen some of the greatest guitar players ever fall out of sync, from Keith Richards to K.K. Downing, even if only for a brief second. Never Malcolm Young. And not only was he always in the pocket, he was fucking loud. Three chords never sounded louder. I've seen stories that Malcolm just naturally played so loud, his amps would be at half the volume that the rest of the band was. And he'd need picks for every song, since he'd demolish them in each song he'd play. You can't get much more rock and roll than that.And mostly importantly, he wrote all the songs. Some of the best guitar riffs of all time written by this one guy. Back in Black, Highway to Hell, Thunderstruck, TNT, Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap, Whole Lotta Rosie, Moneytalks, Hell's Bells. The dude wrote the air guitar bible. As the band put, they made 15 albums with Malcolm that all sounded the same.

I grew up in the south in the early 2000s and always listened to country and at a very young age, I was playing on my aunts Windows XP computer and found a music folder and discovered Back in Black along with TNT and You Shook Me All Night Long in the folder. My older cousin used to burn CDs and downloaded those from limewire for pump up songs before his football games. I had no idea who they were as I had never been exposed to heavy music before. My mom used to listen to classic soft rock but never anything heavier than maybe 1 or 2 Aerosmith songs. As soon as I heard the Back in Black riff I remember just starting to headbang not knowing what headbanging was. Then the lyrics started and I lost it, it was the most amazing thing I had ever heard and I loved every minute of it. A day or two later I went to town with my mom and we went to Sears and I asked her about ACDC. She told me it was just a band from the 80s and I asked her if I could get a CD. She said sure and that day I got ACDC live at Donington. Little did I know that this album would literally change the rest of my life. After that my obsession with rock and metal began. I wouldn't have the friends I do today if it wasn't for that album, nor would I have the chance to play the guitar.

He had an ablation using a cryoballoon catheter to electrically isolate his pulmonary veins from his left atrium. The procedure has about a 70% - 80% success rate for people with paroxysmal Afib on the first try. Since he says it comes and goes on it's own it's paroxysmal. Anti-arrhythmic meds can help control it but it will keep getting worse over time. If i were him I'd have a second try at ablation with either the same doc or a different one. There are also other modalities to use for ablation besides freezing that can be  effective. Much like Buckethead's amazing hands help make him an amazing guitar player the docs hands have a whole lot to do with the success of these procedures. I'm not saying his doc isn't excellent, the best in the world does not have a 100% success rate or close to it. \nThe stroke risk he is referring to is because blood tends pool in the left atrium (specifically the left atrial appendage) when the heart is fibrillating rather than beating normally and clots can form because of this. The clot can travel from the left atrium to the left ventricle and then be ejected out of the heart and travel to the brain causing a stroke. To prevent this patients need to be on anti-coagulant meds to keep clots from forming.  \nAfib is a manageable disease but it is progressive and will lead to other issues if not managed well. \nOther options include implanting a dual chamber pacemaker and ablating the A/V node (electrical messenger between the atrium and ventricles). This treatment can keep the ventricles beating in a normal rhythm even if the atria are fibrillating. Tends to increase cardiac output and makes patients feel better. They still have a stroke risk so they need blood thinning meds however.  And long term they will need new devices/leads placed as the battery is used, heart function degrades or technology improves.  \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "do9k5pm", "post_id": "75wbgr", "comment": "this sucks.

But my mother had a heart condition where her heart would start beating really fast for no apparent reason and it would get 'stuck' beating that fast, and it got worse over time. \n\nAt first they were able to give her medication to get her heartbeat back in line, but after a while that stopped working. \n\nAfter that there was a period where, when she noticed it happening, she'd go to the hospital and they (I could be wrong here), temporarily stopped her heart (with meds or with a defibrillator, I'm not sure), and that worked 3 or 4 times, but then eventually even after stopping her heart for a few seconds it would start beating just as fast as before. \n\nOne time (the last time before major surgery) they couldn't get it to stop for a long time. This could be the time that they had to use the defibrillator, I can't remember that well as it was a long time ago. Anyhow, this is when she decided that she can't keep going to the hospital every month.\n\nEventually she ended up having to get surgery to cauterize some nerve endings on her heart. If I'm remembering correctly there's a few nerve endings that are the main culprits when this type of thing happens, but unfortunately cauterizing those didn't work either. \n\nShe ended up having to sign a waiver because the other other option was drastic, and (from what I remember) they induced a rapid heart rate and sort of just started cauterizing shit (I'm not doctor so I'm sure there's more too it than this, but yeah). The operation worked and she hasn't had another heart malfunction since! She didn't tell us about the whole 'last ditch effort' part of the operation until we were older..\n\nLuckily it all worked out, and I have no idea if what Buckethead is going through is the least bit similar, just thought this might be a good change to share this story!\n\n**TL;DR**  \nMom had this same type of thing and ended up having to have a medically induced heart rate spike, and have a bunch of nerve endings on her heart cauterized to fix it."}, {"comment_id": "do9ujta", "post_id": "75wbgr", "comment": "Mr. Bucketkopf, pls lay off the kill switch for a while please.

I'm sorry you have to go through this!

You mentioned that you feel like you were rushing at one point, but honestly I think thats one of the best parts! Staying in time is important, but sometimes it's important to break out of the grid and it serves your song very well here. Also try thickening up the bass just a little. You could achive this by adding a little bit of compression and/or drive. Be careful so the bass frequencies of your guitar and bass don't clash to much.

I know exactly what is going on in your mind and soul. This is because I did nearly the same thing when I lost my 21 month old only child, a boy, late last December in a terrible accident. It's fucking beyond words how it messes you up and I could go on an on about it but I wont. I was out of town when he died, he was with his mom, so it leaves me in a strange pergitory. \n\nI've been playing guitar for 17 years now and it's still hard to get things together correctly, I certainly do not have a natural talent for it. Regardless I just recently built a small home studio, very simple setup. I'm still learning my way through Studio One 4 and it's a real bitch. I much rather just use a loop pedal and play live and record on a phone but obviously sound quality is shit but it's still a welcome relief. I just let it record for 30 mins at a time and go back and scutinize every thing I did wrong, especially on the leads.  I learn from it and move on. \n\nIsn't it funny how you can hear the song in it's entirity in your head but is somehow difficult (for me at least) to get your hands to play it and even harder to convince others that it's a good solid tune lol. Patience is absolutely a virtue and I have gained much more respect for those who do this professionally, audio tech and musician. \n\nAll in all I feel your pain my friend and music is hands down the best coping mechanism I have yet to find, better than any drug or drink there is. Your song sounded wonderful, very Santana like. I hear the issues you do too with the recording but that's how it goes. Your lead was awesome man, much better than I could do live or in a recording thus far.. So well done. I'll see if I can send you a link of some of my stuff or if you have IG or FB message me and you can find it on there if you care too. Hell you'll def feel better about your playing after hearing me haha. msg me anytime if you'd like. This is one of those life experiences where being alone will fuck you up worse. Trust me on that. \n\nMuch Love Man \n\nEdit: heres a link of me working on a song about my boy live with loop pedal and shitty amp, this video is me actually figuring out the lead.

I\u2019m very sorry to hear about your fianc\u00e9e, that is a huge loss so early. Sending lots of love & positivity your way. \n\nSince you asked for constructive criticism, I\u2019ll list a few of my thoughts while listening:\n\nYour vibrato sounds tense. Practice your vibrato with your muscles a bit more relaxed. A few players with great vibrato would be David Gilmour, dimebag darrel, bb king, and steve via (should cover evert genre). You are clenching your hand and using your shoulder, relax and use your elbow/wrist instead. \n\nYou pick hard! So hard that it defines your notes at times. You may find that using some slightly heavier strings will turn that strong attack into delicious tone :)\n\nYou have very nice phrasing. Sometimes you speed up and start playing a little faster than your brain is moving, but I think you\u2019re aware of that already. it may help you to keep both in pace with each other if you practice some faster licks with a metronome, slowly increasing the speed. \n\nYou mentioned you struggle with mixing, I would recommend reading up on \u201csubtractive equalization\u201d methods as they will help you to get your tracks to sit in the mix in a more defined manner. Ideally you\u2019d like each instrument to occupy its own section of the frequency spectrum. Compressors are a great thing to start learning early on as well. R/audioengineering is a phenomenal resource for more info on recording. \n\n\nHope this helps give you some focus on your progression, lovely playing my friend :)"}, {"comment_id": "e8lb2li", "post_id": "9rvgkh", "comment": "I\u2019m standing outside in 40 degree weather listening to this on repeat.

Im not even going to try and be decent and try; because, with all due respect, no one can feel what you feel right now.\n\nWhat I sense when listening to this is \u2018forced\u2019. Yes the emotion is there,... the story is there,... the feeling is there,... but its forced. Its forced in the sense of you trying to get that emotion out of you, but not sure how to get the world to understand., that feeling inside of you - outside to the world. It doesn\u2019t make it reflect the true emotion, but it is a cry out of the emotion you are feeling you want to cry out to the world.\n\nSo basically what I said makes f$ckall sense; I know, but what I want to say is I feel for you, I see/feel what you are trying to do, and want to congratulate you or rather tell you you are on the right path of working through this.

There is much to improve, but you have talent! You made a very beautiful piece of music! If you practice a lot more I'm sure you'll be astounded of the beautiful music you'll make someday!\n\nThere's tons of people that have way more skill and make music far more complex, that just isn't moving at all.

I hope you heal and I'm so sorry for your loss truly."}, {"comment_id": "e8lan8x", "post_id": "9rvgkh", "comment": "I respect what you're doing, so I'll give you what you asked for as a musician of over 15 years.\n\nI'll start by saying something nice, because that's how I was raised. You definitely have a lot of potential as a musician, and the soul you bring forth in your music forces one into your world, into your suffering (in this song at least). It brings people into that feeling of pain and torment that you're feeling, which means you've already essentially mastered the hardest part about being a musician.\n\nNow, onto the criticisms:\n\n1. Your solos don't seem to come from the same (emotional) place as your chord progression, which can come off as confusing to those attempting to interpret it. You start off fine, but using a slow, sad chord progression and ramping the solo into a Jimi Hendrix version of the National Anthem kinda kills the somber mood of it. I would suggest using the chord progression to enhance the solo by studying the music theory behind the emotion you're drawing from, and pull from that on both fronts.\n\n2. You seem to desync the tempo of the solos vs the chord progressions. The way I've found to help this is to have a metronome at the same tempo for both while recording. I personally bring my phone (on airplane mode so you don't get that feedback sound if you get a text/call) with earbuds plugged in using the SmartChord app to help sync my stuff. If you don't like a metronome, you can always use a drumbeat (some recording software will allow you to place a template beat over what you're playing. It can help make a mood better sometimes if used properly).\n\n3. You seem to change between effects way too quickly. I guess you could chalk this one up to artistic preferences, but keeping one efect active for at least 4-8 bars (depending on tempo and time signature. In this case, based on my best guess, that'd be closer to 8) and transitioning properly into an effect with a similar atmosphere (generally interpreted \"mood\" or \"tone\"). That is to say, don't go from a raindrop effect to a normal effect instantly. Change it to something more \"wailing\" like a slidebar or echo effect first, then normalize it after. This eases the transition between bars to make the feeling more fluid, in my experience.\n\n4. The tempo seems to \"wobble\" as in there are moments where you'll speed up and then, almost as if to compensate, you end up slowing down beyond what the song calls for. The metronome/drumbeat thing i suggested earlier should help with that. \n\nOn first listen, those seem to be the more important finds. The notes seem extremely accurate, despite a few \"typos\" here and there, but that's normal, and gets better with repeated practice, but otherwise you're a great guitarist, and your work has potential to revive blues to the masses if done right. \n\nGood luck, friend, and I hope this whole thing works out for ya.\n\nEdit: sorry for poor formatting if it's there.

Music always helped me cope with loss, though I was never brave enough to share it - or finish anything really. Write all of it out - it will not only ease the pain a bit, but it will be great to listen back to this period of your life, though always bittersweet.\n\nYou asked for critique, so I'll not even try to go easy on you. The idea and the composition is good, though some variation in the backing wouldn't hurt. Unfortunately the execution is raw in a different way - make sure to always stay in the green when recording, especially at the start I seem to hear some unintended crunch. Don't be afraid of many, many, many takes with the guitar, and splicing, overlaying them to compose the solo you want to hear - you can always learn it later and re-record the final idea once you are 100% happy with it. This helps you practice your tempo, expression and also the recording process. I would certainly play with the delay time, as it interferes with the backing more then it blends. EQ-ing is SOOO hard to learn properly, but a lot of plugins have amazing instruments presets which are a great starting point to sonically separate the tracks, and give them each space. Proper panning also helps with this, and a pair of very precise headphones is the best for EQ and pan, as most home studio layout and monitors struggle with this. I find normalization for instrumental tracks essential, and I only polish and compress after all tracks are normalized. Compression makes or breaks the final product, so A/B compare the results a lot, and let your ears rest hours or days if possible before finalizing, listening fatigue is real with this.\n\nKeep on keeping on dude, and I'd also recommend getting into a band. It's fun to bounce ideas off of each other, there's always a geek around who can help you out with the studio stuff, and just being around people having fun has it's own effect.

As someone without much family remaining that must be difficult.\n\nBut you did say you wanted some constructive criticism that wasn't merely praising you. I'm not trying to be cruel, or overly negative in anything I'm about to say. \n\nThe beginning. It's fine, beyond a few very slight mistakes (perhaps it's merely the recording, however). With that said, the idea of the echo effect on the second guitar doesn't work. Not merely how it's mixed (which isn't terribly well executed), I think you should drop it altogether. I get the idea, I do. But ultimately it adds nothing and unless you're actively trying to channel Di Meola to \"play against the clava\" just abandon it. It's extraneous. \n\nNext is the lead in general. None of it feels particularly well planned. I get the sense that you're executing familiar patterns, but without much regard for the progressions taking place behind it. One simplified piece of advice I can impart is to write down the chords, and the notes within them, mark which are shared between the chords, and try integrating the solo more around that. This can be easiest helpful with a piece meanders out of key. \n\nSo far as I hear it, the solo merely sits on top and doesn't contribute anything that feels immediately necessary, or complementary to the music. You rush bits too much, without allowing a particular moment to hold and play it. \n\nLet the piece breathe more. You don't need to fill up every moment. This is mainly in regards to the piece after 1:10 or so. You can do better, though, and that's the beauty of it. You're clearly not entirely novice to the instrument. You needn't be Miles Davis insisting upon strict adherence to improvisation -- but work out something that fits within the progression and then improvise from there. \n\nI can expand on any of this more, if you want. I'm just trying to be brief and general. It's a good effort. But you and I both know it can be better. \n\n\nCheers. And keep your head up.

King, Elvis Presley and Pete Townshend.\n\nA restructuring support agreement with senior secured noteholders will help it repay bank loans while going through a \"change of control\" transaction, according to papers filed Tuesday with its Chapter 11 bankruptcy in Delaware. The petition estimated up to $500 million in debt, and the lenders have agreed to an operating, or \"debtor in possession,\" loan of up to $135 million to fund operations.\n\nThe change in control will give noteholders equity in a new company, replacing current stockholders such as Chief Executive Officer Henry Juszkiewicz. According to court filings, current noteholders include Silver Point Capital, Melody Capital Partners LP, and funds affiliated with KKR Credit Advisors. The restructuring will also allow the instrument business to \"unburden\" itself of a consumer-electronics unit that Gibson blamed for its financial woes.\n\nGibson, founded in 1894, sells over 170,000 guitars annually in 80 countries. Its guitars are U.S.-made, with factories in Nashville and Memphis, Tennessee, and Bozeman, Montana. It also sells studio monitors, headphones, turntables and other musical instruments.\n\n\n\n**\u2018Exit Path\u2019**\n\n\nIts Gibson Innovations business, acquired in June 2014 from Koninklijke Philips NV, was the source of its financial woes, according to a court statement from Brian J. Fox, a managing director at Alvarez & Marsal who will serve as the company\u2019s chief restructuring officer. Acquired through a leveraged transaction, the business faced significant sales declines due in part to a loss of credit insurance overseas.\n\nWith the noteholder agreement, the iconic company has \"an exit path from Chapter 11 as a deleveraged business, poised for continued growth,\" Fox said in the filing.\n\nFox described the electronics business as having become \"trapped in a vicious cycle in which it lacked the liquidity to buy inventory and drive sales.\" Cross-defaults had threatened the musical instruments business, and the company has been working with advisers since the fall of 2017 to try and solve the problem.\n\nBefore the filing, Gibson reached an arrangement with major constituents to its musical instruments business, but not the consumer electronics business, Fox said.\n\nThe case is Gibson Brands Inc., 18-11025, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, District of Delaware."}, {"comment_id": "dy9jxq5", "post_id": "8g80ck", "comment": "Looks like they might be downsizing back to guitars and few other audio related product lines only.

(\"Gibson\" or \"the Company\"), today announced it will be re-focusing the Company on the manufacturing of world-class, musical instruments and professional audio products and the continued development of the Company's portfolio of iconic, globally-recognized brands including Gibson and Epiphone, by reorganizing around its core businesses.  The Company has reached a \"Restructuring Support Agreement\" with holders of more than 69.0% in principal amount of its 8.875% Senior Secured Notes due 2018, and its principal shareholders, that clears the pathway for the continued financing and operations of the musical instruments business as well as a change of control in favor of those noteholders.\n\nTo implement the agreement, the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries today filed pre-negotiated reorganization cases under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The filings will allow the Company's Musical Instruments and Professional Audio businesses to continue to design, build, sell, and manufacture legendary Gibson and Epiphone guitars, as well as KRK and Cerwin Vega studio monitors and loud speakers, without interruption. The Restructuring Support Agreement provides funding for the musical instrument and professional audio businesses, supports the Company's key vendors, shippers and suppliers, and provides for the restructuring of the Company's balance sheet. Gibson will emerge from Chapter 11 with working capital financing, materially less debt, and a leaner and stronger musical instruments-focused platform that will allow the Company and all of its employees, vendors, customers and other critical stakeholders to succeed.  Henry Juszkiewicz, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Gibson Brands, and David Berryman, Gibson's President, will each continue with the Company upon emergence from Chapter 11 to facilitate a smooth transition during this change of control transaction and to support the Company in realizing future value from its core business.\n\nThe Company's Gibson Innovations business, which is largely outside of the U.S. and independent of the Musical Instruments business, will be wound down. The wind-down of the Company's GI Business is not expected to impact the Company's reorganization around its core Musical Instruments/Pro Audio business.\n\n\"Over the past 12 months, we have made substantial strides through an operational restructuring,\" said Mr. Juszkiewicz.  \"We have sold non-core brands, increased earnings, and reduced working capital demands. The decision to re-focus on our core business, Musical Instruments, combined with the significant support from our noteholders, we believe will assure the company's long-term stability and financial health.\n\n\"Importantly, this process will be virtually invisible to customers, all of whom can continue to rely on Gibson to provide unparalleled products and customer service.\"\n\nIn conjunction with the restructuring, the Company received commitments for $135 million of debtor-in-possession financing from its existing noteholders. This financing, combined with cash generated from its operations, will provide the Company with the liquidity necessary to maintain its operations in the ordinary course during its reorganization proceedings.\n\nThe Company filed a series of motions that, pending Court approval, will allow the Company to operate its business throughout the process in the ordinary course, and to provide support to critical business-partners including vendors, shippers, and suppliers. The first day motions will allow the Company to continue to buy goods, manufacture and distribute its products to its customer base and continue to honor its warranty policies in the ordinary course.\n\n\"We are grateful for the continued support from our employees, customers, dealers, partners and suppliers as we move through the restructuring process,\" said Mr. Juszkiewicz. \"The Gibson name is synonymous with quality and today's actions will allow future generations to experience the unrivaled sound, design and craftsmanship that our employees put into each Gibson product.\"\n\nAdditional information is available by calling Gibson's Restructuring Hotline, toll-free in the U.S. at 1-844-240-1258.

A piece of shit harmony I bought at a yard sale for ten dollars. I kept it around as a beater when I got better, and eventually took it with me when I went to live in a friend's basement. It was a concrete hole in the ground, but it was mine, and at the time, that was enough.\n\nSo this basement is under an old house with dilapidated hardwood floors and no insulation. I made the horrid mistake of placing my futon directly underneath the toilet upstairs. Me and my friend came home from work one night to find his alcoholic mother ignoring a very clogged toilet that had covered the floor of the bathroom with liquid feces. We freaked out and ran downstairs to find my bed covered in shit water. And guess where I left my acoustic?\n\nThere was shit water sloshing around inside it. I almost puked from the smell. I ignored the bed, which I figured I would have to replace anyway, and went to work saving the acoustic. I dumped the tincture of Satan out of it and began blow drying it, which brought forth more stench. Once I felt it was dry enough I put on some gloves and began sanitizing the innards with Clorox wipes, never really knowing if I was going to pull out a poo-covered hand.\n\nSomehow I convinced myself that it wasn't completely disgusting and kept it around, and refinished it as a project years later.

Follow a free internet program like http://justinguitar.com, or get some decent instructional books like [Fretboard Theory](https://www.amazon.com/Fretboard-Theory-1-Desi-Serna/dp/1508566593/) and put in the work, now.\n\nAn analogy I like to use is that it's like stepping into a gym without a plan or a workout routine and just bouncing from one station to another, lifting things without any set goal aside from just being their and doing *stuff*.

I could strum cowboy chords every bar without any warm up, and with really cold hands, no problem. \n\nIt's when you get into the really trickier things, where being warmed up really is the difference between feeling like you regressed to a much lower skill level, and feeling like you're unstoppable king of the world. \n\nTiming and dexterity is where it makes a big difference, and like you said, it's kind of like being all lubed up. \n\nThe human body is designed to work best when it is warm, because that's when nature would have had you running for your life. Every day activities aren't the difference between life and death. Running from a threat, is. \n\nIt's like car engines. In the middle of winter, when you start your car the oil is thick and crappy. Once the engine really warms up, that's when everything is optimum. That's the way we are. \n\nMost people never notice that for guitar, but it's real, and the difference is significant. It's not just being kind of picky or snobby or just for show.\n\nIf you ever ask a good player out of the blue to just play something, it won't be as good as they are capable of, in the dexterity department.

I absolutely love it. I play hours a day. I'm pretty good. My method of learning has only *ever* been: hear a cool song, think \"this sounds like a fun challenge, I'll learn this!\", learn it, repeat.

My music theory is of an absolute minimum. :(\n\nI have no idea where I should begin. I'm not looking to become a complete wizard overnight, it would just be nice to be able to pick up a guitar and play some scales, use it to write some cool licks, idk.

You'll never believe me, but when I got up I decided out of nowhere to put on the Bold as Love alternate take from that purple cover \"The Jimi Hendrix Experience\" compilation album. When I picture Jimi Hendrix rising to heaven (typically on a pillar of fire), that recording is always playing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNo single musician has had as big an impact on my taste, playstyle, and musical ambitions as Hendrix. I've probably spent more time picking apart his records note for note than anybody else. I've spent hours hunting for obscure alternate takes on sketchy forums (shoutout to [crosstowntorrents.com](https://crosstowntraffic.com)), read multiple biographies on the man (check out Room Full of Mirrors, it's the best imo).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPicking my favorite song or songs of his is really tough. Of the one's I've learned, I'd have to give it to Wait Until Tomorrow or Little Wing. What first drew me to Hendrix as a player was his distinctive rhythm guitar style. The songs where it features prominently (Little Wing, Wait Until Tomorrow, Bold as Love, The Wind Cries Mary, his Like a Rolling Stone cover from Monterey, etc) have always attracted me as a player. I'm still struggling to really absorb his lead guitar style a la Redhouse or Come on(let the good times roll), it's so different from more straight ahead blues playing (Eric Clapton or BB King).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFor those who haven't heard [the album I mentioned above](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Jimi_Hendrix_Experience_(album)), absolutely check it out. It's got a ton of fantastic recordings -- live and in studio -- that most have never heard before. Another great album to check out is [Acoustic Jams](https://www.discogs.com/Jimi-Hendrix-Acoustic-Jams/release/1096154) if you can find it. It's a bootleg released in the late 80s by Sphinx Records (I don't know anything about this company, if anybody does please reach out to me). It has both rough acoustic takes where it sounds like Jimi is rehearsing his way through songs and alternate takes that I've never found anywhere else. The recording of Angel from this album is bar none one of my favorite recordings of his. It bears little to no resemblance to the final recording that you can hear on First Rays of the New Rising Sun; it's just Jimi playing and singing alone. It's a great reminder that behind all the legend, he was a man."}, {"comment_id": "e66qgqs", "post_id": "9gtd4s", "comment": "Little Wing or 1983"}, {"comment_id": "e66qqr5", "post_id": "9gtd4s", "comment": "Purple Haze and his national anthem performance at Woodstock."}, {"comment_id": "e66stiw", "post_id": "9gtd4s", "comment": "Crosstown traffic"}, {"comment_id": "e66sulq", "post_id": "9gtd4s", "comment": "The face I make when listening to Band of Gyspys version of Machine Gun is absolutely atrocious.

I'll tell you my story and I don't feel a shred of guilt\n\nIn my city at one point there was only one guitar store and the owner was a 100% known and certified scam artist, he'd rip off kids and their parents every chance he got and usually changed prices depending on the customer as the prices were usually hidden on most products.\n\nI stopped going to that store once I got ripped off buying strings a few times and I just started ordering them online. They were pretty innovative since the small shop had a \"used products\" section and it even had very badly done listings on their home page. I was curious what crap they were trying to scam people with and I went to their website a few years after not going to the store. On the website was mostly 10-20 year old dusty electronics being sold as if they were new, but one listing caught my eye. It was a Japanese Jackson Randy Rhoads V from the 90's with an original floyd rose... for 270\u20ac. The guitar didn't look the greatest but it was mostly just dirty and not damaged, the guitar was worth at least 800\u20ac after a cleaning and setup but probably over 1000\u20ac. The owner seemed to be more of an old guitar type of guy so I guess he wasn't familiar with V's and metal guitars, anyway I was going to buy it.\n\nI was pretty poor at the time and I just had the money for the guitar, it even happened to be a model I had dreamed of having for years so I was excited even though I probably was going to sell it. I went to the store feeling a bit anxious about what I was doing, but when I was in the store checking it out I remembered how they scammed people a lot when I saw the owner's son scamming someone else the same way as me with guitar strings, so no hard feelings. I bought the guitar for 300\u20ac (yes, they fucking scammed me again :D), but I didn't care since I was going to sell it for at least triple that.\n\nI sold the guitar online pretty quickly for 1300\u20ac as there was a buyer who wanted it immediately so I made a huge profit. I doubt the scammy store I bought it from bought it at a high price wherever they got it from so what I did was barely even immoral.

So many comments on this subject. I'm not going to judge you or any of the other comments here. I do want to say that way in the past, I've done some stupid shady things. I'd say this went on for a while in my younger years. Back then I wondered why my life sucked and always had bad things happening to me. It took me a bit, but I finally realized that it was due to my bad karma coming back at me. When I finally figured out that my actions were causing me heartache, I changed my life. I now help people when I see they're in need. I'm honest with people in my life, and people I deal with outside of my family. Honestly, every day I look for a way to help at least one person or more if possible. Even if it's something small like holding a door for someone when their hands are full, making someone laugh, or just smiling at someone when passing on the street. I'm in no way a religious guy, but I've sure learned that karma is the real deal, and that's what I live my life by. My life is so much better since I've adopted this. Do bad s' and it comes back three fold. Do good in life and you will be rewarded by the universe. And people that think karma is total b.s. are entitled to their opinion, but I see it differently due to looking back at my own life. So maybe if you're wondering how to make your life better/happier, try to do as much good as you can. Most importantly think about your actions before you commit to them. \n\nI also know there is a lot of hate for guitar center out there. My experience has always been good, for the most part. I don't care where you shop, things aren't always going to be 100% positive. I will say, I love that when I have some spare time, I can go to my local GC, and play some really nice guitars. Try some different style guitars that I wouldn't have ever had a chance to pick up and play. Especially the $2500 acoustics, Martin, Taylor, or whatever. The workers there are locals. They play in bands, and are into music throughout their lives. Are they all the best sales people? Maybe not. The ones at my GC do seem to care though, and truly get excited about music and equipment. And not just because they're trying to make a sale. I've bought three guitars and other equipment from GC, and I couldn't be happier with every purchase. It's also convenient to visit them and pick up things I need that I don't feel like waiting for to be shipped. Maybe I'm different from the rest, but I don't want to have to do everything online. I like to talk to people and experience an actual music store. Be it GC, or a mom and pop shop. To me if Guitar Center closed their doors for good in the future, that would really suck. Also, I don't work at GC, or have any ties to them. Just my opinion because I see so much hate towards them.

Beck opened (played first) that night and then Stevie played; it was 1989 and when he played Voodoo Chile I was **reborn.** At the end Carlos Santana came out, picked up one of Stevie's guitars and the three of them jammed. At the risk of immense understatement, it was a fuckin awesome show.\n\nTwo years later, and half the reason I moved to Texas was Stevie from (the other half was circumstances largely beyond my 21-year-old control). When I first landed in Dallas, my Jackson was in need of a technician's hand (I had gotten fucked up and screwed around with the truss rod) so I got the \"phone book\" out (it was 1991) and the biggest and coolest ad in the Yellow Pages was Charlie's in Dallas. I did *not* know Charlie's was one of Stevie's favorite guitar shops at this point, I assure you. I didn't even know Stevie was originally from Dallas - I thought he was from Austin.\n\nI made the 20 minute drive to Charlie's, and made arrangements for my guitar to be worked on. As the guy was taking my info, I look up at the wall and see a picture of Stevie. I commented on the huge bummer that was his recent passing, and the dude at the counter told me a story of Stevie sitting at the end of the bar ***folding quarters*** in his left hand and dropping them into a pickle jar. The first check I wrote off my brand-new-to-Texas bank account was for that repair. I still have it. I treasure it, not sure why.\n\nI've since seen pretty much every documentary made about Stevie at this point, and when I learned about Charlie's I ran to my squirrel-like horde of financial crap and dug out that check and stared at it in amazement.\n\nFor my money Voodoo Chile (Slight Return) from the Live Alive is in my top 10 \"holy shit\" electric blues rip-the-neck-off pure ecstasy moments. For another, find Gary Moore doing Red House at the Fender Stratocaster Tribute Concert.\n\nLove Stevie, maybe he'll be there when I get there and he's playing on the patio of a small house-turned-bar kinda joint through an ancient Fender tube amp and there's brisket in the smoker and beer in the fridge"}, {"comment_id": "eyatisj", "post_id": "cw7m31", "comment": "I visited his grave back in April..Such a peaceful place for a legend.."}, {"comment_id": "eyauluf", "post_id": "cw7m31", "comment": "My Mom was at his last show."}, {"comment_id": "eybp6yp", "post_id": "cw7m31", "comment": "i've listened to him ever since i was a teenager, but i've just started to really appreciate him and his music fairly recently. my guitar instructor wants me to learn as much blues licks/solos as possible and since i love SRV's playing, i've been transcribing it for the last week or so."}, {"comment_id": "eybrzla", "post_id": "cw7m31", "comment": "I was there that night.

I think that the way it really needs to be said is \"**expensive** gear won't **necessarily** make you play better.\"\n\nI understand that to a lot of people, that means the same thing, but it really doesn't. Many newer, inexpensive guitars play great.\n\nI wouldn't want to start out on a sub-$100 \"cheapest guitar on amazon\" but you can sound great on a used Epiphone SG G310 for $150 or a G400 for $250 and those generally play well. That's not a lot of money - 5 tanks of gas. There are a shit-ton of great playing guitars out there for $200-$300 used.\n\nI think that shaming a player for wanting better gear is crappy. But there's also a lot of hate thrown towards lower end gear that makes players feel like they *have* to upgrade or they won't be taken seriously. It's a circle. Have a cool Harmony Bobcat? That was a \"student\" guitar. Les Paul Jr.? Same thing. Mustang? Music Master? Champ? They were all \"crap\" 40 years ago.\n\nOn the other side, there are a whole lot of hobbies that are way more expensive and there are a lot of other instruments that are massively more expensive. Anyone price cellos lately? Or even *cheap* fishing boats? Any recreational pilots around here? I know people who's yarn budget exceeds what I've spent in 5 years on guitars and related stuff.\n\nIn the scope of things, the price of guitars exists in a very narrow range. You can assemble a professional grade touring rig for the cost of a used motorcycle.\n\nThere are potential players who are scared to go into a Guitar Center and be judged.

My older brother was 8 years older than me and had started playing guitars. He had been using my dad's Fender 12 string acoustic, and my dadi's Silvertone semi-hollow body electric guitar, sometimes referred to as the Jupiter, although the Sears model is not actually a Jupiter, although both are made by the same company and appear to be the same.\n\nSo we get there and his friend gets out a case and opens it and it's this beautiful SG, must have been brand new. But even at 5 years old, it was apparent to me that the SG was a much better guitar than my dads' Silvertone. The finish on the guitar was on par with our mahogany dinner table which we have to put pads on before we were allowed to eat or do anything at that table. So as a five year old, in the most superficial way, I determined one was better than the other strictly on looks.\n\n6 years later my older brother bought a brand new SG Delux with a bigsby. Wine red and just a beautiful guitar. My brother was married at 18 and just bought this beautiful guitar with money he earned himself. And it was pricey at $575. Now my brother was no great player, he's more of a three chord progression type player. But he loved that guitar and it made him have this great attitude whenever he played it. He was very proud of it and always talked about how Gibson Guitars were the best. All this had an influence on me. I didn't think much about it at the time because I was left handed and didn't really consider playing guitar. At this point I'm 11 years old and my next oldest brother learns to play guitar on that same Fender acoustic and the Silvertone. After my oldest brother bought his SG, he gave the next brother the Silvertone.\n\nSo three years later I decide I do want to learn to play guitar. Second oldest brother had the Silvertone, and I hated playing the Fender 12 string acoustic. So I borrowed one of those cheap Japanese guitars of the 1960's and 70's from a friend. He never learned to play it and it just sat against a wall in his bedroom. They only retailed for around $75, but by this point you could get one at a yard sale for $10-15. \n\nSo we had songbooks and in particular we had this 1000 song book of music, including the guitar chords. So by learning the chords as they were shown in the music book, and learning a lot of songs from it, that I recognized and after about a month, I could play basic songs. This made me confident enough to ask my dad if I could play the guitar he bought from my older brother, who bought it but sold it to my dad when he got hard up for cash. It was a 1968 Dan Armstrong. Not a scratch on it. He just asked that I treat it like my own. So now I've only been playing a little over a month and I'm playing this really nice Dan Armstrong. But this had only become possible because number two brother, who had been playing the Dan Armstrong, moved in with his Girlfriend, so he wasn't around much. He would come over if there was a jam session, or party, but mostly I got to play it. But then brother number two got married and was moving away to another state.\n\nAt this point I had been playing about 9 months and one of my main influences was Rush. Particularly Alex Lifeson, who in 1976 acquired his first Les Paul. I was only 14, but I decided, I wanted a Les Paul Custom. So right before my brother was about to leave my dad came to my room and told me that my second oldest brother wanted to buy the Dan Armstrong off of him, but if I wanted it, I could have it.\n\nI won't go into a great deal, but my dad is notorious for giving things and then taking them back, just saying they were his, as if he had never given them away. And I knew he would use this as control over me, so I declined. I told him to sell it, that I was going to buy a Les Paul and all I wanted was to make sure second brother gave me Silvertone, so I would still have an electric to play.\n\nBut at 15 I lied about my age and got a job in a restaurant. Minimum wage was $2.15 an hour. But three months later, I had a brand new 1977 Les Paul Custom that I bought myself. \n\nNow, what I thought was going to happen was having a new Les Paul was going to make me sound a whole lot better. I'd been playing a year and a half and was starting to become a competent players. But that is not what happened. Instead, It made me a worse guitar player, or more accurately it showed how sloppy my playing really was. I was not in control of my guitar. It was making noises I didn't want it to make and wasn't making noises I wanted it to make. This guitar was not really for an amateur like me. It was made for pros, people who knew what they were doing. So I had to start from scratch.\n\nI had to learn not just to play guitar, but the guitar itself. I had to learn all it's parts and how to adjust them. I had to find out how to make this guitar sing for me. It took a year of neck adjustments before the neck settled down to where It needed to be. But at 41 years old, it hasn't needed adjusting since. It took a long time to set the bridge and tailpiece to get the action right where I wanted it, with no fret buzz. I learned everything about that guitar right down to what guitar chord and it's length.\n\nSo this has led me to tell lots of beginners to go out and get a great guitar. Commit, to it. Be invested. Start learning the intricacies of your guitar, no matter what you pick. I think having a guitar that was better than me, inspired me to learn how to play it. I think a lot of players get frustrated from having cheap gear that won't give them what they want, and they quit playing.  They think it's their fault. The pride of owning your dream guitar, will inspire you to make that instrument sing for you. The investment keeps you from quitting."}, {"comment_id": "eew9z6j", "post_id": "ajk12x", "comment": "People say it won't make them a better player because a lot of new players are under a few grand illusions and misunderstandings about gear, of course the counter to that point is that if they don't experience the more expensive gear they will never learn the truth.

I bought a 50 dollar ebay special package with an IRIN branded strat clone, gig bag, strap, trem bar, and some hardware.  At the same time I bought a used copy of Rocksmith with cable for another 50 bucks.\n\nI have problems almost immediately, in the very first shifting lesson.  The game refuses to recognize the first fret and the twelfth fret.  When I go into the tuner, I can see why - they're not ringing as the notes they're supposed to be.  This led me down a rabbit hole of technical setup - none of which I had ever learned before - but the way I went about it was all backwards because I found the intonation stuff first before I found the advice that says I should adjust the truss rod before all else.\n\nThe neck was not totally secure.  One screw needed tightening.  Then the thing was bowed, so I adjusted that.  But not before I had adjusted intonation, and because I wasn't happy with the results the action, too.  Once I had the neck looking good, then I tried to intonate but at this point the action was kind of fucked.  I just had done what I always did and kept breaking stuff until it seemed fixed.\n\nThen I got a radius kit off Amazon and used that.  I'm not 100% sure I did it right, because what I got wasn't much like the videos I had seen, but I understood the goal of the exercise so I think I did alright.  Altogether I ended up tightening a neck mount screw, adjusting the truss rod, correcting the action, intonating the strings (of course: new ernie ball super slinky set), I went inside to fix one of the pots, and also took apart the jack and reassembled it so it would quit making noise and dropping out for no reason.  In the 7-10 days that I was doing all of this, the bottom strap nut stripped right out of the wood, and that... seems like a different kind of project.  (If anyone has a suggestion feel free to send it along.)\n\nI hope by now it's clear I'm no easy quitter.  At the end of this process, I felt empowered to go ahead and just build my own guitar.  Although, I didn't - I definitely want to now.  Instead, I managed to make the cheap wreck sound about as good as my playing (which isn't a high bar) although it still seems to buzz at times.  God knows what might be loose, my hunch is one of those bridges north of the nut (whatever they're called).  Or it might be my action, but so far I can't localize exactly where it's coming from.\n\nI did end up buying a Legator I can't seem to identify (I think it's a tele-body jazz-master style but I'm going on what I see in pictures) that I picked up in a pawn shop for about $250.  I'm a lot happier playing that, and I haven't really had to adjust anything (although I haven't checked the radius, I did check that the intonation is accurate).  Sustains like a beast next to the other one, which seems to drop out early on the lower two strings.  It is a tad bit more challenging hitting the high notes.\n\nI just bought a bass and decided not to put myself through all this again.  A Squire Jaguar. \nHopefully that works out.\n\nAnyway all this rambling to say this: I don't believe a casual learner would be inclined to spend as much time, effort, and money as I did trying to make that cheap thing work right.

If I absolutely abhor the way my guitar sounds through that amp, well, that's a valid reason to get a new one.

You still need to put in the work. If your gear allows you to put in the work because it just works (instead of eg having to tune it every five minutes) or it inspires you to pick up the guitar just because you love to play it - then, yes, then it will make you a better player over time.

After the first couple of months, I hit a plateau and I kept on trying but I could not progress much with that guitar. My bends, vibrato, timing... pretty much everything was horrible (now that I look back at it). I could play some easy songs but that was just about it. In a year or so my friend on the other hand bought a $1000 dollar guitar (ESP LTD Deluxe EC-1000) and we were so eager to come back from the store, plug it into the amp and hope that it was not our ability stopping us. Within 5mins of plugging the guitar in, we kept it back in the case and wondered why it still sounded so shitty. After taking a years break, I bought an rg 350 hoping that it would instill some excitement back again. I played for a bit but then decided that I wanted to learn the guitar properly so started searching for a guitar teacher. I found one local guitar teacher and I still remember him playing and me suddenly going like... 'You sound good because your guitar is better than mine'. We swapped guitars and thats when I realized a lot was about the technique than the guitar itself. My techniques and knowledge like bends, vibrato, music theory got better really fast after taking professional lessons. I then invested in my own sound system to record etc with focusrite, guitar rig, pedals etc. and the motivation for me to play increased further. I still invest in a better sound system because I do feel that when you hear yourself play even something as simple as an open G chord and it sounds great it does make you feel amazing. However, one has to have proper technique as well to really make it sound better than just with the system (pickups, pedals etc.) itself. That is just my opinion. I think buying goodies are a good TEMPORARY motivation but a permanent motivation would be technique and just like some peeps here mentioned temporary motivation is important but relying on the fact that money will buy you the techniques etc. is just wrong"}, {"comment_id": "eexbtmm", "post_id": "ajk12x", "comment": "I only play simple scales over barre chord progressions and occasionally noodle in FACGCE and I have two very nice guitars.

Not completely untrue, but sort of ignoring the more glaring deficiencies in their signal chain in my opinion.\n\nAnd I do see a lot of people recommending tube amps to newbs whose stated budget is $300. And ironically, they're not even recommending a specific tube amp, but ANY tube amp, as though it's the singular defining characteristic of a good amp. \n\nI simply don't see newbs getting talked INTO keeping crappy $90 Chinese guitars from Amazon.

I started on a Schecter Synyster Gates Standard, he is my favourite guitarist and I liked using his guitar.

I was 14. I could play 8-10 hours a day, and the only reason I didn't is that my shitty-ish guitar was hard to play for extended periods of time (see above regarding string action, had to string it with 11s because it had some weird burr in the block that would break the G in like an hour of play otherwise, pickups were so microphonic you could pick up satellite broadcasts, etc). The other thing that would have blocked me had my guitar not been so shitty was how terrible my amp sounded.\n\nNow, 14 year old me *loved* both of those things, guitar and amp, but over that summer I found a '66 Gibson SG for sale for $400 (oh, the 90s in the midwest). I played it for two hours in the store, I couldn't put it down. I put down a layaway payment, got a job, came back a month later with the most cash young me had ever held at one time and the store owner told me he gave it to his buddy because he thought i wasn't coming back. He told me he'd sell me a brand new Epiphone for the same price. I told him what he could do with my genitals and where I thought he should go and I was thereby banned from that guitar store, but nothing of value was lost.\n\nAnother local store, this one I took lessons from, did a full setup on my shitty guitar. It made it slightly less shitty. In that store was a Princeton Reverb that had been hot-rodded with a Celestion and frankly sounded more like a Marshall than a Fender. It was the amp I got to use when I came in for lessons. He offered to sell it to me for $250, I didn't buy it, and I still regret that 23 years later.\n\nNow, had I had that amp and that guitar, I never would have put my guitar down. I know this to be fact. My studies would have suffered, I probably would have stopped learning how to computer (and thus missed out on my career), but I would have been *so good* at guitar.\n\nThe thing is, now that I'm in my 30s and playing as a hobby again (and before you ask I do not have an SG but I do have a Princeton), I know that what would have been *far* more valuable than *good* gear would have been gear that I *loved*. To Kondo it up, for it to spark joy. It doesn't have to be better or even have a better setup, it just has to be a guitar where when you see it, you want to pick it up. An amp that you want to turn up until the neighbors call the cops.\n\nThat can be cheap and objectively terrible, as long as you don't ever want to put it down.\n\nTBH I wish stores would sell kits to build/finish your own guitar for teenagers that don't suck. Like a primered and routed body, neck, all the hardware and electronics. Let the kids put them together, set them up, and give them the best paint job they can."}, {"comment_id": "eey4jip", "post_id": "ajk12x", "comment": "Started about 1.5 months ago, bought an extremely cheap acoustic guitar.

Everyone has met a player like this - \"I can't get these runs down, I'm gonna pick up a $3000 dollar guitar tomorrow though - it's got a smoother neck and will make me play better\" ...

What I would say though, and what I suspect might be the middle ground in this argument, is I truly think a new guitarist should start on acoustic. It's not starting on a shitty gear, but rather starting without crutches. Before even getting close to an effect pedal, or even amp settings, I think it's essential that a guitarist learn to make great sounds with nothing but metal strings and a piece of wood. That's when you develop the subtleties in your fingers that will make your future electric guitar playing much better than it would be if you had just started by shovelling effects over your sound. Also, acoustics are just harder to play, so your fingers will get some sweet gainz. That being said, in support of your argument, putting a piece of junk in the hands of a beginner is a very good way to make them give up.

What does buying something more expensive have to do with it?\n\n> The neck and pickups and all of that are still 100% useable, just give it a proper setup with some good strings and you're set.

Change it up. Chances are you feel this way because you aren\u2019t structuring your practice tightly enough. Noodling around familiar territory instead of forging into the new. Rick Beato reminded me to \u201cpractice what you DON\u2019T know\u201d once you got it, move on to something else. Practising is NOT the same as playing. Separate them, learn something new, then let off some steam riffing around old stuff once you\u2019ve learned something new. Maybe try to incorporate some new stuff into the old.\n\n2. Embrace your level. It\u2019s absolutely, hunky-fuckin\u2019-dory that there are a shit ton of players who are better than you. Embrace it. They exist to inspire and teach you. Learn from them, but don\u2019t turn them into a tool to beat yourself about the head with. Everyone has been where you are. Some folks know jazz because they dug out of their rut and finally cracked it. Is it impossible, or is it just practice?\n\n3. Play some gigs / find a band. The only way to get (whole) songs under your fingers is to play them A LOT. Play gigs, make mistakes, learn get better and have fun doin it. \n\n4. You\u2019re past the \u201ccollege years\u201d. No one is impressed that you can play some \u201cof the moment\u201d songs. That moment passed and now the only person who gives a shit is you. You gotta do it for yourself now. \n\n5. Set clear targets. Why did you decide that you \u201csuck\u201d? What are the things you need to learn to feel like you don\u2019t suck? Make sure they\u2019re attainable-it\u2019s not realistic to make \u201cbecoming Steve Vai\u201d your only parameter for success.\n\nThis got waaay too long.\n\nTLDR: be kinder to yourself; it\u2019s OK to not be the best; play gigs; do it for yourself;set clear, achievable goals.\n\nGL "}, {"comment_id": "e9ejly2", "post_id": "9vqx8d", "comment": "Ok hear me out.

I'll never forget it but the bassist tried to tell him what key it was in, etc. etc. and he cut him off.

Here're the songs I selected to teach my students and why:\n\n1. \"Angel\" takes on a whole new meaning when you learn that Jimi's mom abandoned him as a baby and would occasionally creep back into his life briefly to play head games with him. Shapiro seems to think this trauma with abandonment is why Hendrix often came off as aloof.\n2. \"All Along The Watchtower\". Jimi crushed this cover so hard that Bob Dylan literally bequeathed this song to him. This is also the first song that really made me fall in love with the electric guitar. I used to know all the solos as a teenager.\n3. \"Castles Made Of Sand\". The opening lick is so dynamic and challenging and at the same time insanely fun to play. Love the lyrics too. I actually wrote a paper on this song in college.\n4. \"Hey Joe\". This is the one that sold my kid students on Hendrix. Chords and licks are approachable for intermediate players and it harkens back to the old school Mississippi delta blues sound that inspired Hendrix when he was growing up. I learned in the biography that Jimi took to sleeping with his guitar like the old blues men. I'm doing the same thing and it's actually been amazing for getting in extra practice and writing time, even if it's messing with my sleeping habits.\n5. \"Voodoo Child (Slight Return)\" is maybe my very favorite cover in my whole rep. The opening lick is so iconic and the way it explodes into that droning Eb is incredibly satisfying. For the times especially it was an incredibly ambitious track from the standpoint of sound engineering. If you're trying to explain what a wah wah does this songs sells you on that sound in like 3 seconds.\n\nI don't have time to get to them but I also love \"Fire\", \"Burning of the Midnight Lamp\", his cover of \"Day Tripper\", his Woodstock set...\n\nMaybe it makes me sound basic but to me he's the greatest guitarist to ever pick up the instrument."}, {"comment_id": "f0onnwl", "post_id": "d5xt55", "comment": "I love his mistakes.

Even the famous quiet intro section, with the muted strings followed by the intro melody, isn't what I love about the track. And although I think Hendrix's lyrics and vocal performances tend to be underrated, this isn't really a track that particularly emphasises them either.\n\nNo, for me the track is all about *that riff*! It seems so simple: a lot of vamping on the E chord, a few low G notes on the 2 and 4 beats, and some of bending of the G string 2nd fret. But there are so many variations on it, with unpredictable differences in bends and timing and effects. It's a great illustration of how much mileage you can get out of a really simple blues riff and the root chord.\n\nThere aren't many actual chord changes in the song, so it's probably not the favourite track of those who prioritise harmonic complexity. So the descending chords (diads?) on the line \"I pick up all the pieces and make an island\" are always a welcome twist when they turn up.\n\nAnd then later, halfway through the song, when things quieten down and get more subdued for the \"let me say one more last thing/I didn't mean to take up all your sweet time\" section - that's one of my favourite changes in dynamics in all of rock music."}, {"comment_id": "f0pxvir", "post_id": "d5xt55", "comment": "I don't agree with people saying he's the best guitarist of all time, but I love his music and the dude was cool and creative as hell. For example, the video of him playing Foxy Lady at the Miami Pop Festival in 1968, or him playing Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club band in Sweden in 1967. Both of those videos are on Youtube, and I used to watch them over and over again, because everything about him was just so cool. The height of his guitar strap, the way he stood, his stage moves, the way he dressed... cool as hell. Also the fact that he was left handed make his videos more asthetically pleasing to watch because he would stand on stage right with Mitch Mitchell in the middle and Noel Redding on the right, so the symmetry between him and Noel Redding makes it cool to me. Also kinda sad that I'll never be able to look like that on stage because I fret the strings with my left hand.\n\nNow about his playing. I haven't looked too deeply into his >5 minute songs, but the guy could defenitely play the blues very well. Not every blues player can keep a crowd interested for more than 15 minutes on a single song. But I doubt he'd be able to solo over any changes that are more complicated than a I-IV-V.\n\nHis rythym guitar playing is what people talk about the most when they talk about Hendrix, and I defenitely think that's where he shined. Whenever people talk about the \"Hendrix rythem guitar style\", they mostly play chords and play double stop fills in the pentatonic scale, but Hendrix did a lot more like that. Songs like Little Wing and Castles Made of Sand take that pentatonic shit to the next level by playing those fills in the second and fourth positions instead of only. the first position for A string barre chords and the third for E string Barre chords. Songs like One Rainy Wish and Wait Until Tomorrow also include some weird rythym guitar stuff that he only did on those specific songs. But I can say with confidence that I've heard things I've never heard from anyone else in Hendrix's rythym playing. Even though I can play all of those songs I listed note for note, nobody has found a use for them as good as how Hendrix used them.\n\nAnd lastly his improvising. Dude could improvise the craziest shit on lead and rythym guitar, but especially on rythym. Woodstock Improvisation and Little Wing are probably the best examples of this.\n\nI could go on for hours about Hendrix, but to end it here, that guy was a massive influence on me. His songs are pretty much my favorite ones on guitar to play. And I really wish I could look as cool on stage as he was."}, {"comment_id": "f0pyqvv", "post_id": "d5xt55", "comment": "Voodoo Chile & 1983 (A Merman I Should Turn To Be)"}, {"comment_id": "f0pytse", "post_id": "d5xt55", "comment": "If I have to pick just one track with Jimi, it's Red House.

I see it as just straight talk.  It's like anything else that's worth doing.  You'll suck at first, but you can get good at it if you stick with it.  It's no different than learning the violin or a foreign language.  \n\nIt IS possible in a short period of time to be able to play a few basic chords.  If you already have some singing skills, you may even be able to play and sing a simple song.  Maybe.  Some people find singing harder, and then that's one more thing that takes a bunch of time to master.  \n\nMy advice to people is to start simple.  Learn a simple song that is just a few basic chords.  That will create a feeling of accomplishment and then you can learn more.  \n\nI have no problem  with straight talk.  You're not going to play like Eddie Van Halen in your first year.  You CAN become a decent basic player in that amount of time and then build from there.  Learn to tune your instrument without the aid of an electronic tuner.  (See my other post).  Learn basic chords and how to play good rhythm guitar.  Learn your scales and how to play some simple leads before attempting to shred.  A lead doesn't have to be complicated to be good.  It needs to be melodic and fit the song.  See Van Halen's leads in Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love and in Running with the Devil.  They're simple, but effective.  He has other leads where he shreds."}, {"comment_id": "er3xu6s", "post_id": "by4234", "comment": "Hey thanks for posting this.

I have been playing guitar for 53 years and if I would\u2019ve had YouTube back in the 70s I would have been a much more accomplished guitarist that I am today. \n\nEven with all the years I have played I still will occasionally seek out a tutorial on YouTube. It saves me tons of time and the instructors I choose are spot on! \n\nI am sure that this thing\u2026 Whatever it is called is a good platform for beginner guitar players and possibly some intermediate and possibly even advanced players. \n\nMy take on this is Reddit is  trying to knock down the competition. You never ever cut down a competitor! Ever! You simply advertise what you can do better. The bottom line on this Reddit is not going to gain many people at all from YouTube. Of course, my thoughts only. This applies to the way I think and possibly a few others but definitely not everyone.\n\nIf you want to learn how to play guitar the first thing you really need is dedication! Lots and lots of dedication and time, tenacity, desire! Whatever platform you do choose just make sure that you work/practice every day with your guitar! \n\nIf every day is too much then possibly you don\u2019t love your instrument enough to really excel on it. But if you do\u2026 Practice practice practice! \n\nOne last little thing\u2026 Tone is in the technique! You cannot purchase tone! Yes some of what you bye can help your tone but overall, it\u2019s your technique so, work on it!"}, {"comment_id": "ezzlapn", "post_id": "d2p7dp", "comment": "I think YouTube can be valuable for learning an instrument, with limits...    It's not an either-or decision.\n\nOne of my favorite YouTube guitar guys, Griff Hamlin (Blues Guitar Unleashed), offers both free content and fully organized extended courses.  It was his free content that made me see the value in paying for his full courses.  That said, as a guy who played bass for decades and is learning guitar in his 50's, I see it like this:\n\n\\- The hard part is often finding the pony in the pile of manure on YT.  There are some great content providers, but the best teachers with the most organized content often aren't free.  There's a lot of free trash to pick through before you find the few that best speak to you, and wading through it takes valuable time that could have been spent learning.\n\n\\- Especially early on, a quality live teacher can help prevent poor technique or repeated mistakes from becoming poor habits.  Also, a video can't grab your hand or fingers, move them into position, and show you exactly what a technique should feel like so you can develop muscle memory of good technique.  They can also help you with sound, guitar and equipment selection and setup, and provide answers to nagging issues quickly.  Only a live person can...  Recording all of your practice and using a metronome can help you more honestly self evaluate, but many folks don't have the gear or skills to do so.\n\n\\- The scheduling of a regular live lesson can help some folks stay focused and on track, creating \"due dates\" if you will.  The feedback of a live person can also help develop a very efficient and focused practice routine.   The sheer volume of online content can easily create musical ADD as you chase the next squirrel that comes into view.  Some folks are great self organizers, others (most) aren't, especially when you don't know enough to know what you don't know...\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI originally learned to play bass in the 70's with \"Book 1\" and a weekly lesson, with boring homework to practice each week.  With few other distractions, progress seemed slow at first, but the skills learned early built me into a solid player.  YouTube lessons, free jam tracks, online sheet music and tabs, etc...  would have greatly enhanced the intermediate-on learning process for a very low additional price.\n\nAll in all, I think a good live teacher and quality online content can go hand in hand to provide an efficient, high quality, learning experience.  I work with one now and we fully incorporate online resources, and it helps."}, {"comment_id": "ezwav5h", "post_id": "d2p7dp", "comment": "ive seen that a lot, and always thought \"well, all the justin/andy videos are decent instruction'"}, {"comment_id": "ezwfc1d", "post_id": "d2p7dp", "comment": "I love seeing these same ads on YouTube.

Their beginner stuff is a little dry but very well done. I was not a beginner and I tried to plow through it but eventually got bored with the simple, very boring songs that made up these first lessons (and there are hours and hours of them). Their rock course is a lot better, and the lessons are faster paced, and the practice songs that the instructor has you play seem to make more sense as you play through them so you aren't trying to read the music charts you just instinctively hit them.\n\nThere is most definitely a benefit to using a dedicated App, or a website that can show you sheet music/tab along with the video and you can arrange/size it, put it over how many screens etc. you have vs. using a youtube site. That's just a benefit of having a dedicate platform. All of the sites I've looked at (guitar tricks, jamplay, fender) really seem to nail this aspect. They also fully license their tracks so you do get some backing tracks and other materials that many youtube sites can not provide.\n\nAre they worth paying for? That's up to the user. Justinguitar and others also have paid materials that are good (some would argue vital) supplements to the free material and in case you haven't noticed, nothing is truly free on the internet. There's revenue coming from somewhere and these guys aren't doing it from the bottom of their hearts, there's always an endgame to get paid. With the paid platforms you are just committing up front.

There are different styles of learning and levels of patience.   Some folks might even get frustrated just manipulating  the video with rewinds or different playback speeds in YouTube, or any thing to do with using technology that way. I\u2019ve seen veteran teachers and outstanding musicians in tears in Technology in music Ed. grad classes(2006) because they couldn't do some of the computer based steps in the final. I've seen many people just say hell no to dealing with tech or the internet that way.\n\nAlso for some it's an endless supply of content. I use it myself everyday for new licks or styles to try.  For the right person they could learn how to shred just watching videos. \n\nMy only major complaint is a lot of awesome players use awkward or incorrect language and that can be confusing to some hearing the same thing called different things .   I watched one of my favorite guitarists show an Eb chord then say the triad notes were. Eb G A# . Oof. \n\nI mean that\u2019s not physically incorrect but it\u2019s too confusing and more harmful then helpful.\n\nSame thing if some one says \u201cthis song is in G# major\u201d  , cringe cringe , well, I guess Key of D is  Cx(double sharp major) now...  \n\nI could go on but yeah there are a lot of incorrect  explanations and wrong notes even with the live transcriptions they are providing of known music. \n\nBut, that could be true with a one on one guitar teacher.    It\u2019s like the telephone game . Teacher guy might learn licks off YouTube that are slightly incorrect( or googling tabs . There are far to many straight up wrong tabs online) ((songster is good I haven\u2019t seen many mistakes on there)).  then teach student while adding possible layers of incorrect info. \n\nSo who ever said YouTube lessons are 100% better is patently wrong.   It depends on many factors.  As a teacher , I beg my students to use YouTube supplementally ,  especially for backing tracks or learning riffs of songs they love.

You can practically learn to play guitar without ANY resources. If you play anything that sounds good, good job you learned a note or whatever. Add another tune to it, and you can practically make a song out of that.\n\nPlaying guitar is, fundamentally, about 'feeling right' imo.\n\nVisiting courses or having someone teach you is a great entry as it eliminates a lot of the early frustration but it is definitely not vital.  \n\n\n\\*Edit\\* I did advance pretty quick for a newbie, i'd like to add that i made a friend along the way (at age 17) that encouraged and helped me to get better (he was already playing in another band so he shared a lot of knowledge).

I am sad that such a disclaimer is needed but this place is what it is.\n\n  With that out of the way. I think the OP is presenting this out of context a bit. The caps are not just basic replacement caps. they are spec'ed exactly like vintage ones and the market they are directed at are those looking specifically for vintage or vintage spec parts. Not new parts that sound the same, not new parts that work just as well but vintage correct parts. \n\n  /u/fuckmangione had it right when he/she compared this to the parts that you would buy when you are restoring a old car. If you are after a part that will work and be close enough, you don't need to spend a whole lot to get it. If you are looking specifically for something that is in new but built exactly to the original spec's, The prices will depend on how many companies are making said part and the demand. \n\n  This looks like a situation where Gibson has commissioned a company to make a specific run of vintage spec'ed caps. That is not a trivial matter as it involves sourcing outdated materials, getting the tooling setup and so on. \n\n  This is something that is marketed to those that specifically want a historically accurate Les Paul. It is not a sneaky deception. Those who are after such a part know what they are getting themselves into in the same way that someone might pay a large amount of money for a exactly accurate, vintage spec speedometer assembly for a vintage Jaguar as opposed to a less accurate but cheaper version.\n\n  It's not a scam, it's just being sold to a very specific and demanding market."}, {"comment_id": "cora5y4", "post_id": "2whtrg", "comment": "I really don't think that these are aimed at you and me\n\nHow many times have you thought \"hmmm, might change my guitar's capacitors!\"\n\nThey're aimed at people who are restoring an old 50s lp and yes, shit like this WILL probably help it keep a little more of its value because that's how restoration jobs work. You've spent an additional few bucks pointlessly on something nobody will ever see but that is SLIGHTLY closer to the look/smell/sound/feel of the original item, it increases the value of it.\n\nSo while they've had to build the equipment / hire a company to supply something like that to the tiny few people who call them EVERY month asking if they've got any of those old capacitors still lying around, (and yes,  the price is waaay to high for what they're getting) , to those guys it's still totally worth the money but you bet Gibson are going to add some sales speak to the thing to make them feel better about it."}, {"comment_id": "cor4mbq", "post_id": "2whtrg", "comment": "I can see these being purchased by the 'vintage tone seeker willing so spend exorbitant amounts of money on gear that has no effect whatsoever'.

The power scaling control will set the amount of headroom that the amp has, so it won't control \"volume\" per se."}, {"comment_id": "dcbzwmi", "post_id": "5nj8wx", "comment": "DON'T YOU TELL ME WHAT TO DO!\n\n*upvote*\n\nAnd you know what else?!

Maybe on some old electrical equipment, then your least favorite guitar. Learn to solder and recognize which parts do what. You'll be much more prepared when you start working in an amplifier. Big tube amps can be dangerous if you aren't careful.\n\nJust get a lower wattage amp if your amp is too loud. The most common mistake people make when buying an amp is buying a 50-100w tube amp thinking that it will work for them in a suburb. You need space to let those things breathe.\n\nBig tube amps are for stage/recording. You do not need one to get good sounds in your bedroom or apartment, in fact they will actively work against you because getting them to sound good requires a lot of volume. If you have the space then by all means, but then why would you be trying to attenuate the amp?\n\nAttenuators aren't good solutions. They can stress your amp and cause premature wear and tear if the amp isn't properly maintained, or if the attenuator isn't well made.\n\nI've always thought that attenuators were dumb. Like putting a dog in a muzzle and chain all day. You got a dog, let it be a dog.

These bands were not just consumed to rock out to but people like Ginger Baker and Cream were seen as prophets capturing the voice of a generation and bringing that into the mainstream in a revolutionary way.

I too have done a solo loop-pedal tour :)\n\nI can relate to your experience directly, although my 'tour' was not as long-lived as yours. My setup was also different, as I used guitars, a violin, and vocals. I too quit the sales gig, taught English in South Korea for two years, and then structured a 6-week solo tour from Chicago to NYC and back before moving out west. I had busked a few times in Chicago (which requires a permit that is waaaay to hard to get from city hall if you work a 9-5 job) and although I enjoyed it, I wanted this tour to be booked at venues. Indieonthemove.com was absolutely instrumental in making this happen. I was able to book every date via email and sample videos from Korea before leaving. \n\nSome part of me had always wanted to be professional musician. Unlike most, this feeling didn't really gain a lot of momentum until my younger twenties. After playing in a fun band for a few years around Chicago, I wanted to take things solo and really 'make it.' If I had a little cash, I knew I could at least give it a try. So that's what I did.\n\nHere's what I took away: It made me realize I was happy to not be a professional musician. And there is no negativity about it. At one gig a little further along on the tour in Cleveland, I was sick (headcold) and I REALLY, really did not want to perform. But I didn't have a choice - I was billed and had to follow through on the commitment. Right there I decided music, to me, was not about an means to an end. I made a conscious decision that I never wanted to have it be a way to put bread on the table, because it lost everything I liked about it. \n\nI still play music daily, and ironically I'm making more playing music than I ever have before (classic rock cover band). My favorite is the local community symphony, which has a phenomenal director and a gorgeous performance space. Sitting second chair in a performance every three months is more fulfilling than a week of looping gigs. \n\nBut I am still so, so happy I did it. Not just because of the cool experience, great people / musicians I met, some great cities I had never been to (specifically Philly and Pittsburgh) - but because I have cleared my future conscience. I will never say \"man, I should've gone for it in my twenties.\" It just made me realize I'm happy with music as a fun auxiliary feature of my life.\n\nThis was a few years ago before the tour started (Incubus cover): https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=322&v=jkb2WtYIZZw "}, {"comment_id": "cvpkcwe", "post_id": "3nla96", "comment": "So write that book to fund the second leg of the tour!"}, {"comment_id": "cvpkorn", "post_id": "3nla96", "comment": "you play intriguing music.

Either way write it! \n\nAs for this being considered marketing, well so be it. Almost every professional or semi pro in this thread has mentioned that to do music as a career means not ignoring the business side. Use the momentum! Musician, busker or author, any of them are on your terms and avoids going back to the corporate world.\n\nCouple of questions.\n\nWould you play only your own songs or covers too? \n\nDid you have a set list prepared beforehand or like a theme you would jam on with the looper? If so, did you have this down tight before you headed off on your trip or performed it on the street?\n\nI've been planning on doing something similar to this for the past year. Got a battery, inverter and pedals (the world of loops opened my mind a while back) and was planning on just going to parks and jamming, which works fine in my room. Hours pass and I thought it would be a breeze. \n\nHowever with spring hitting (I'm in Australia) and me preparing to take it to the parks, im realising that if I add the pressure of playing to an audience (just imaginary pressure at this point), I can't just bounce ideas like normal. When I listen back I hear all the minutes of noodling instead of in key playing and some of the volume jumps with the pedals can be overwhelming. I've spent the past 2 weeks working out how to make some of these jams into repeatable songs, and the process of playing 4-6 hours a day, almost every day, is full on. Sometimes it almost feels like I shouldn't bother and just stay in my room. \n\nBut fuck it makes me stoked when I show someone a song and they dig it. To them it's 10 minutes of something. For me, it's 20 hours of playing and refining. \n\nI'm 30 in a couple of months and I think that's why your story resonated with me. Everyone is getting married and having kids, they own their own homes. The looks I get when I'm chatting to people range from stoked to shocked. I really hope I can post a story of my own this time next year. \n\nSorry bout the long post."}, {"comment_id": "cvq12cf", "post_id": "3nla96", "comment": "I was just wondering what became of you.

It probably plays better than the cheap EVH's you see in shops, or the same for a lot cheaper. I wouldn't worry about the Floyd, although when she finally gets a Floyd, she'll hate you for not putting one on sooner ;) If you do get an aftermarket Floyd, make sure its high quality. I've completely warped the metal on cheaper (still genuine) Floyds on guitars like current Kramer Pacers - after a year of heavy gigging - But I've also got 15-20+ year old Floyds that perform as good as new. Quality matters with metal. If you do make a new guitar, consider using locking tuners with your floyd, throw the locking nut they give you away.\n\nA Floyd in the right hands takes 5mins to restring and 2 mins to set up, but 1 second to throw everything out and make you rethink your choices in life, if you aren't prepared. But once she gets used to it she'll outstring you before you know it. And check out Schaller for a Floyd. They made the originals, they still make them to spec under a different model name. \n\nI don't know what pickups you're using, but I would consider some hot Seymours Duncans, maybe JB's, particularly in the bridge. I wouldn't worry at all about the rosewood/maple fretboard, it just doesn't matter as much in an electric. But maple always looks hot on a shredder. If you get a new neck, you might like to try something nice; quilted, birdseye maple?\n\nAlso whatever you do, totally buy your daughter a EVH amp, the little lunchbox amp is amazing. Expensive but ... EVH. \n\nThis will be something she keeps forever, whether it becomes a wall hanging when she gets her future beasts or stays in her arsenal, she'll be proud of her father and her old 6 string twanger. \n\n"}, {"comment_id": "drs1q4h", "post_id": "7m7qt0", "comment": "Screw the Frankenstrat, get that girl an EMG loaded Explorer to go with that sweet Metallica shirt!"}, {"comment_id": "drs0o41", "post_id": "7m7qt0", "comment": "I doubt it will be scary."}, {"comment_id": "drs6rru", "post_id": "7m7qt0", "comment": "Well done sir.

The first part is just a subjective interpretation of the modes, after that is the theory. If anyone has any questions, please feel free to ask. I don't mind explaining things more in-depth. \n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nAlright, I'll give this a shot!\n\n**Ionian** is of course, the major scale. Pretty straightforward, sounds happy. In my (very subjective) opinion, most things played in the major scale sound very cheesy/poppy to me unless someone is playing it in a unique way. \n\n**Dorian** is by far my favourite mode to play in. I believe it was an /r/guitar comment that described it this way and I completely agree - Dorian is the minor scale after it's heard some good news. To me the natural 6th adds that tasty bit of flavour to the minor scale that's heard in a lot of rock, folk, blues, and some metal (power metal anyone?). \n\n**Phrygian**, like /u/TheoriesOfEverything said, sounds very flamenco styled to me. In addition, a lot of metal (black metal, death metal, etc etc) and psychedelic rock uses this scale because it's got a certain 'unknown' flavour to it. \n\n**Lydian** sounds like the major scale but much more mysterious to me. A lot of the crazy intense guitarists (Steve Vai, Joe Satriani, those kind of guitarists) use this scale wonderfully to make some very interesting music. Personally, I find it hard to make music around the Lydian mode, it always ends up sounding like something else!\n\n**Mixolydian** is the slightly more gritty major mode to me. The flat 7th makes the mode sound less 'straightforward major scale' and gives it a little extra kick. Lots of styles of music use this mode, including but not limited to pop, rock, progressive rock, psychedelic rock, and folk. I find a lot of rock bands will use this as opposed to Ionian when writing more upbeat songs to retain their edginess factor, haha. \n\n**Aeolian** is the straightforward minor scale, or as I used to call it - the 'metal scale'. Used in tons of different styles of music (not just metal like young me once believed), this is a go-to for sad/melodic type of stuff. \n\n**Locrian** can go fuck itself. Nah, just joking. I've just always felt this mode sounds strange and a bit 'unresolved'. No idea how to use it effectively, probably some intense jazz stuff would suffice. \n\n**DISCLAIMER - IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE THEORY OF MODES, GO NO FURTHER.**\n\nThe major-type modes (Ionian Lydian and Mixolydian) are all diatonic scales built off of the major pentatonic. \n\nThe minor-type modes (Aeolian Dorian and Phrygian) are all diatonic scales built off of the minor pentatonic. \n\nLocrian is built off of minor pentatonic b5. \n\nThis may help you understand the intervals a bit better. Think of the other modes as being built off of the major and minor scales (Ionian and Aeolian respectively). \n\nIonian (#4) = Lydian\n\nIonian (b7) = Mixolydian\n\nAeolian (#6) = Dorian\n\nAeolian (b2) = Phrygian\n\nAeolian (b2, b5) = Locrian\n\nThe awesome thing about the modes is that they all line up in a specific order. That order is Ionian, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian, and Locrian (yeah I wrote my thoughts about each one in that order for a reason). What I mean by this is that if you take C Major on the piano and move up 1 note to D, and play the same notes as the C Major scale but starting from D, you now have D Dorian. Go up one more, you now have E Phrygian. One more, F Lydian, so on and so forth. This works this way because of the intervals of each mode. C Major's intervals are W W H W W W H. If you take that first Whole and tack it on the end, you now have W H W W W H (W) <--- that being the first one we moved up. This order of intervals is Dorian. If you move the first interval of that to the end, you have Phrygian. Hopefully you can see where this takes you if you keep moving the first interval to the end. \n\nI hope that helped explain some things, and if anyone smarter than me has any corrections please reply and tear me apart!\n\n**TL;DR** Fuck Locrian. Nah, I'm kidding. Sort of.\n"}, {"comment_id": "cghgmtz", "post_id": "21xghz", "comment": "Some people seem to be confused about these diagrams, so I'll try to help explain them for those that are having trouble.

The other dots are the notes that are omitted from the major scale to create the pentatonic scale.

This is 10 fret string A\n\nDo you want Mixolydian? Note for the Mixolydian you are using the 5. Do you want G Myxolydian? Match so that the 5 of the scale is on the root. Fret 3 String E\n\nDo you want Lydian? Note for the Lydian you are using the 4. Do you want G Lydian? Match so that the 4 of the scale is on the root. Fret 5 String D\n\nYou are basically moving these shapes so that the roots match \n\n\nHere is an alternate modal approach. I am still learning them so I do not have a perfect understanding. \n\n1) Learn the G Major Scale - Pos 1\nhttp://www.justinguitar.com/images/SC_images/Scale_Major-1.gif\n\n2) Learn the G Major Scale from a theoretical perspective. \n\n\nG A B C D E F#\n\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7\n\nBe able to play this on the 6th string\n\n3) Learn this\n\n1 - Ionian\n\n2 - Dorian\n\n3 - Phrygian\n\n4 - Lydian\n\n5 - Mixolydian\n\n6 - Ionian\n\n7 - Locrian\n\n\n4) Now match 2) and 3)\n\nG Ionian (1) the root is on G (fret 3/string 6). \n\nA Dorian (2) is the root on the A (fret 5/string 6)\n\nB Phrygian (3)  is on the root of B (fret 5/string 6)\n\nC Lydian (4) is on the root of C\n\nand so on\n\nFor all of these cases you are moving the same shape (step 1) to the required root on the 6th string.

He overheard me and suggested we go out to the bar one night. We get to the bar and while the band was on break he went over and asked if I could get up and play a little something. He went over and really talked me up about how I could jam while I was at our table having myself a beer.\n\nI felt my face get flush, as the anxiety started to take over. There were about 20/30 people in the bar and I felt confident. The guitar player came over and handed me a freshly tuned guitar and i felt a rush of adrenaline as I got up to go sit where the band had been playing. I sat down on a stool in front of everyone and looked around and I swear I tried to play but al I ended up doing was smacking at the strings. I looked up and the barmaids behind the bar were cracking up doubled over laughing at me and everything started to get blurry. I was so disappointed in myself. I had been defeated yet again trying to play in front of people. I tried so hard to overcome it. The guitarist felt bad for me and grabbed another guitar and tried to play some songs I might know but by then it was already over for me.\n\nI reached up grabbed the tuning pegs and just detuned it and smacked the strings a few more times and tried to play it off as I was just doing a comedy skit. Reached up grabbed the mic and said \"Thank you very much\" in my best Elvis impersonation and walked off taking the guitar off.\n\nI went and sat down at my table and drank my beer like nothing ever happened. Then the other guitarist came and sat with us at our table and I realized I had tried to play in front of him about 10 years before when I was in high school with pretty much the same results. He just glared at me and I pretended I didn't know him. We left the bar soon after.\n\nIt wasn't until about 5 years later I learned about social anxiety and how it affected me. So many times in my life I have tried to play in front of other people who just stared at me like \"You said you could play, please just stop!\" Its been about 10 years since I realized and have gotten better about playing in front of people but still, it was my personal hell for a long, long time. One thing that helped was making youtube videos where I would record myself when I was by myself and then showing people I knew.\n\nTLDR: Social anxiety prevented me from being able to play in front of people and I made an ass of myself one night because a friend had heard me play when I was alone.I have really bad social anxiety and every time I try to play in front of someone my arm locks up my hands become stone and they look at me like I'm trying to compete in the special olympics of guitar playing.

I think of it like this:\n\nAnyone of us can get on stage for an hour and sit there strumming a G chord and not make a mistake. OK, what about G and C? OK, what about adding a simple lick? Build this scenario to wherever you are skill-wise, and bring that to your first time playing with new people or playing live.\n\nThis keeps you very safe and in known territory. I think a lot of us have the issue where we can sometimes impress ourselves at home when things are flowing. We'll rip some killer riffs, or do some cool chord changes beyond our normal ability, etc. But this isn't all the time. So when you're playing with others, don't gamble that you'll be in the state of mind to flow like you do on those occasions at home. Stick with what you know and have down-pat.\n\nNow, over time, you'll learn that you can step outside of your comfort a little and experiment. But if you sense danger, you can easily pull back to the known.\n\nOf course, this changes if you're in a band that's trying to write songs. You'll get to a comfortable spot where you can each try things, fail terribly, and move on, no judgement.\n\nYou can draw an analogy to every day life. When you're invited to a fancy event, you dress a certain way, you speak and act a certain way. You're polite and reserved. You engage, but try not to go over the top.\n\nBut when you're hanging out with your closest buds, you're laid back, you riff on jokes, you take chances to make the night fun.\n\nSo: fancy event = you playing with others for the first time or playing live.

For people who are hobbyists with music and want to get into recording, may I suggest a different approach? If you have a Mac you can start with GarageBand. The software comes bundled with MacOS, so it's free. It's very easy to record with and comes with built-in drums and other instruments. You can record and mix songs and albums, and from within GarageBand, share them via iTunes.\n\nIf the hobby becomes a more serious pursuit, you can buy Logic Audio Pro from Apple for only $200. GarageBand is actually a \\*subset\\* of Logic, which is a fully professional Digital Audio Workstation (DAW.) Songs you've already created and worked on in Garageband can be opened directly in Logic, where the full range of its professional-level tools can then be put to work on all of the song's components and elements.\n\nI'm a producer and I often start work on new material in GarageBand where I can \"sketch\" out all of the ideas of a project, rearrange the elements, etc., to get an idea of how strong the song will be. If I like what I hear, I then open it in Logic and fully develop the song-- all the way to the final stereo mix.\n\nI don't know anything about PCs but perhaps there's equivalent software available there, too."}, {"comment_id": "e0s4q3z", "post_id": "8rkl1e", "comment": "Some related concepts are ground loops, headroom, gain staging, Fletcher\u2013Munson curves, and FRFR speakers/headphones (especially when using modelers)."}, {"comment_id": "e0sjvwu", "post_id": "8rkl1e", "comment": "This is a solid rundown of available gear, but I feel like it\u2019s a little lacking in amp/cabinet modeling options specific to guitar.\n\nHaving recorded a few bands in the past (using sm57s, 58s, and e609s for the guitar amps as well as various condensers on them for room mics), but just in whatever rooms we had available using blankets and pillows, without a real acoustically treated studio space, I personally think that unless you have a great sounding (or at least neutral sounding, which is hard to come by) room to record in, you\u2019re better off going direct-in these days than trying to mic a guitar amp.\n\nThe catch-22 is that if you\u2019re close-miking with a dynamic mic, that can sound pretty decent without the best sounding room but it\u2019s just a more dry sound that will need more post-processing to sound natural. And at that point if you\u2019re introducing a bunch of that extra reverb and stuff, you\u2019re losing the slight edge in tone you might have had from a real guitar amp vs a modeled one. If you do have a great room to record in, then you can get great sounds with a room mic and close mic combo and a great sounding amp, but for most people reading this advice trying to figure out how to record, you probably don\u2019t have that option.\n\nSo just play direct in and run it through something like guitar rig, or get a pedal like the joyo series amp sims, or amplifirebox or cab dry vr or iconoclast, or a multi effect with amp models built in. I personally prefer pedals for this over software, unless you have a really fast computer, because I inevitably end up with latency that crops up trying to play through the computer. You could also record and monitor totally dry and add the amp modeling in software, but I find the tone I\u2019m hearing back as I play really affects what and how I\u2019m playing, so it\u2019s worth it to be able to hear something close to the final sound as I\u2019m playing. So I use pedals into a recording interface like the focusrite scarletts that have direct monitoring. \n\nFor at home playing and recording it\u2019s really the way to go, you can sound the same at any volume for practice or recording with a lot less fiddling to get a good sound out of your gear."}, {"comment_id": "e0s31xi", "post_id": "8rkl1e", "comment": "I\u2019m having an issue where plugging my guitar directly into the audio interface doesn\u2019t do anything.

A major turn-off of ProTools First is you have to use their cloud storage and can only have three projects before you need to pay.  As near as I can tell Abelton has no significant restrictions for the casual user and I can store all my data locally.\n\nAlso, when discussing interfaces, the new user should pay careful attention to the initial setup of the USB driver (typically ASIO4ALL or similar) in order to reduce latency and eliminate clicks/artifacts.

My dream would be for someone to make a laptop with a built-in (non-USB) guitar/mic input and a keyboard which is removable and can be replaced with a basic mixing surface. Or a standalone DAW with monitor and mouse connections. If you know of anything like that that exists please let me know. Looking forward to part 2.

For example, if you did an E major scale starting on the open high e string it'd look something like this:\n\nopen string: O, 4 (4th fret), 2, 4 \n\n2nd fret: 1, 4, 3, 4\n\n4th fret: 1, 4, 2, 4\n\n5th fret: 1, 4 (9th fret), 2 (7th fret), 4\n\n7th fret: 1, 4 (11th fret), 2 (9th fret), 4\n\n9th fret: 1, 4, 3, 4\n\n11th fret: 1, 4, 2, 4\n\n12th fret: 1, 4 (16th fret), 2 (14th fret), 4\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAfter you start to get comfortable you can switch strings, add slides/bends, do this on 2 adjacent strings for each position (notes within the scale not patterns!). Doing it this way will reallyyyyy stretch your brain at first which is a good thing! Not only will this give you chops to use your pinky, it will help you figure out things to play that actually makes sense.

I give that disclaimer though, only in case my explanation sort of sucks or doesn't make sense. \n\nMy favorite was essentially this, but with the right hand, continuously pluck the string you're playing with your index, middle and ring finger. Three notes. The idea was to break the tendency of the fingers on your right hand to mirror the finger your using on the fret board.\n\nSo begin by playing the sixth string, open, and first fret only, open, 1, open, 1, while plucking with the three fingers on your right hand.  \n\nThen add, open, 1st fret, 2nd, repeat. Next, open, 1st, 2nd, 3rd, finally open, 1-4, until your fretting with all four fingers. \n\nThe finger used to fret  with one hand wont often match the finger plucking that note on the other, and as my instructor said, the exercise is designed to \"split the left half of your brain from your right\".

It was a good read.\n\n\nIt reminded me of an old Guitar World article from back in 1996 (I wanna say the June issue, but not too sure) that was about the auditions for Marilyn Manson's Antichrist Superstar tour.  The album had been recorded, but they needed a new touring guitarist after firing Daisy Berkowitz during the album sessions.\n\nIn this article, written by one of the guys auditioning, talked about how surreal and stressful it was.  Seems that Manson and Co. made things even more stressful on these folks.  Auditions were held in a studio that was once a funeral home, in one of the creepier areas of New Orleans.  \n\nSame as your situation; there were many guys there dressed the part.  Some were more style than talent.   I recall him writing that it appeared  a bunch of guys were only there to meet the band, and not really serious about auditioning.  This may be the reason for some of the stuff the band had set up in the studio. \n\nHe mentioned how there was all this odd, creepy music playing through the waiting room speakers.  Like psychological torture sorta thing.\n\nThe audition itself he says was even stranger.  The band was in the room, but it was lit in a way that you couldn't actually see them.  All the light was focused on the audition area.  Everything outside of that cone of light was pitch black.\n\nIt sounded cool, but terrifying at the same time.  Which, is not really a bad thing.  Would be good to see how these guys handle stress and new situations in a studio rather than at a sold out show.\n\nThe writer didn't win.  The job went to Zim Zum, who was fired during the recording of the next album and was replaced by John 5.  Seems like the studio was not a good place to be for guitar players in that band in the early years.

Search youtube for pentatonic backing tracks to jam over to learn this fast. Don't forget to practise in other keys as well. G major/ E minor and F major/ D minor are most common after C major/A minor.   \n- Know which chords are in the scale of C major/ A minor (the harmonization) and relate them to scale degrees and also starting notes of modes in the scale of C major. Learning the order of the seven modes while relating them to an ordered pair which you already know speeds up this process.  \n- Learn about the circle of fifths and the rules of it regarding adding sharps or flats.  \n- Understand that I used the C major scale as a starting point because it contains no sharps and flats but you can always transpose the general structure to different keys by moving shapes up or down the fretboard. \n\nIf you're going to learn to play modes you might as well want to learn about 7th chords and also learn their harmonization.

Get a transcription tool and starting learning by ear. This does two crucial things: (1) trains your ability to recognize pitches (and eventually intervals, phrases, chords), (2) trains your ability to *find* pitches that you hear in your head on the fretboard, which is fundamental to singing on the instrument (aka improvising).\n\nIf I asked you to single Jingle Bells right now, you could, without missing a single note. If I asked you to do that on your guitar, chances are you'd have to poke around to find the notes. If you start learning songs by ear, that gap will close.\n\nLearning from TAB is almost exactly equivalent to learning to paint using a \"paint by numbers\" book.

Think about it as if you were a chef.\n\nJust because you're not the best cook in the kitchen doesn't mean you're a bad chef, right? If you can follow recipes(tabs & sheet music), understand certain combinations of flavors and ingredients that work together(theory), and can use those two to create tasty meals, then you're doing a solid job cooking. You're still making food that people are going to enjoy eating and that you enjoy making, and at the end of the day that's the point, isn't it? Even if your dishes aren't as complex and unique as the meals that the other chef comes up with? That doesn't mean you should be satisfied with a basic knowledge of ingredients and just following simple recipes, if you really want to get better you should test yourself with more complex recipes and learn more about different flavors and ingredient combinations.

The first one is that every legendary musician was copying someone, at some point, in some way. The key is to not copy large sections, and to not apply those ideas in the same exact way. By learning a repertoire of songs by your favorite artists, you've learned building blocks to develop your own style, now it's just building the skill of applying those things in new ways in original work or improvisation.\n\nMy second point is that almost every single guitar player is or has been at the point that you're at now, and we all move away from it at different points in our development as musicians. Some of us branch out early, while we're still learning the basics of how to play, and some players never really move into improv or making their own music, because they just want to play songs they know and love and have fun. Most of us are somewhere in between, and while you may have taken longer than average, there's no shame in it. Just start jamming. By yourself, with a friend, to whatever music you can find. If you want to start writing original material, consider this excercise: Take a riff that you really love, that sounds good and is fun to play for you, and start changing it. First time, maybe change one note, or remove a note and hold the previous or next note longer. Maybe add a note somewhere as a passing tone. Second time through, do more of that. Maybe try to adapt the same feel to a different scale or tonality. Maybe change up the rhythm a little. Keep doing that until you have something that feels like it's yours. That sort of excercise was the most important tool for me early on in writing my own riffs and song ideas, and is still useful for me now, though less often. Once you've done that enough, you'll have this ever expanding musical library of little bits and pieces of ideas that you can apply in all sorts of different contexts. Different syncopations and rhythmic accents, different scales and what notes in them to focus on to get particular feels. Different ways to articulate notes to give your riffs more character and dynamics. And not only can you apply this to other peoples riffs, but your own as well, which is useful for creating variations or entirely new riffs to write a cohesive song. You can apply the same ideas to lead and improv, but I'm a bit less adept at that side of my playing, so I don't feel that I can elaborate on that too much."}, {"comment_id": "dooropf", "post_id": "77tuky", "comment": "There some backing tracks on YouTube that will show all the notes for the key you are in, right up the neck.

Different advantages to each one. I've known guitarists who could improvise anything but who couldn't hardly read tabs or sheet music at all.

You need to develop your ear for improv.\n\nI still think it should be a good idea. Having your hands able to form the shapes needed without having to think about it will allow you to solo a lot closer to how you want to sing.\n\nThat's another thing to do; sing what you want to play, then reproduce that on your instrument.\n\nThe reason we drill scales and arpeggios into our head so much isn't so we have a bunch of predetermined patterns to play for solos. It's actually so that our muscle memory will be so much faster that you won't have to stop to think about what you're playing to make your solo.\n\nThings to train:\n\nEar training -- hear a note and sing it/play it\n\nSight reading -- learn standard notation. tabs are for beginners to help you transition to this. people spend more time complaining about it but if they just spent some time on it they'll know it\n\nYou need to be able to see a rhythm written on a page and reproduce it accurately in your mind, and sing it. If you can't do that, there's no hope to do it on your instrument.\n\nOnce this process has begun, your mind starts to gain the ability to visualize rhythms without sheet music. It sounds strange, but reading music more often actually trains you to not need it as much. \n\n\nMany guitarists never reach this point. That's how you can push yourself higher.

Say, for example, one day you notice a lump on your testicle - do you have a plan for how you'll deal with this?\n\nOne of my favorite musicians, David Lamb of Brown Bird, passed away last year. He was 35 can was diagnosed with leukemia the year before. He didn't have insurance at the time, as he was working as a touring musician, and racked up tens of thousands of dollars in debt in a matter of days. Then there was chemo and all that. I don't know the details of his cancer, but I hate to think that had he had insurance and the means to get regular checkups he may have caught the cancer at an earlier time when it could have been beaten. No clue if that was even a possibility for him. \n\nHere's an article on the David:\n\nhttp://www.spin.com/articles/dave-lamb-brown-bird-dead-35/\n\n\nAgain, best of luck and I'm not trying to discourage you.

I don't have to retype the artist or song."}, {"comment_id": "etct45u", "post_id": "caz42c", "comment": "A reminder to the very first point in the text: the tabs could be made by you. Don't take them as the truth. The amount of wrongly made tabs is almost shocking and it seems that even the parts made wrong are copied because you might see the exact same pattern in multiple following tabs. So follow your ears. Also you don't necessarily even have to add the 'site:' parameter. You could just search \"youtube that pedal show\" and it will surely give the channel in the results, even though they have their own website too.\n\nA handy way to search is also adding the term you're searching for (related to the second point). For example tc electronic does have user manuals etc, but for some reason the manual doesn't have the electrical specs. But if you google \"flashback 2 power consumption\" you get an url to a different manual on tc site where the electrical specs are listed. Ran to this weird thing just this week. So in short: search with the most specific information you're looking for.\n\nFor the third point: don't limit yourself to just single site like reverb, it might still be a group of people checking each other's prices. I favour looking for that item's price on internet in general. Heavy emphasis on sold items (usually forum posts tell about the price they paid, look for the most recent though) instead of current listings. An example: on ebay most item prices are influenced by other listed items, even though the \"value\" of the item was less. Obviously supply and demand apply, but they could be selling for less elsewhere consistently. Ebay especially is good at pricing high. And of course with the general search you also get the different dealers's prices on current products. Like sweetwater, thomann and anderton's. That'll give you a good idea of the new item's price when comparing for example those places. Helps you judge if the asking is fair (for example this week I saw a listing where the asking for a used was equal to a new item's price, despite claiming it being only tested out, it's used and you can't realistically know if it's actually unused, and you wont get any buyer safeties from second hand so it's not decent to pay like it was new).\n\nAnother advice for searching for information is getting different opinions. Don't just trust the first thing you bump into if you're learning something. Especially try to find conflicting takes. Nothing is perfect and nothing is compeltely trash is a good rule of thumb. Do the same if you're just learning about something, for example I was looking for information about pickup's dc resistance value and found out couple of differen takes, helped parse the useful information. Also don't just trust when somebody tells you something as a fact and don't 100% believe all the myth-debunking articles/videos. The truth is usually in between, they're trying to grab your attention with extreme titles etc and they might end up over-doing it, claiming that there's nothing worth of thinking in it, even if there was something useful when used in the correct context.\n\nAnd find your trusty sources of information. Build up a network where you can trust that the people passing you the information do their homework, are proud of their reputation and willing to admit if they made a mistake and correct it asap. Those people that you can trust for good information. But still get other opinions.\n\nAnd lastly, make a difference if you're reading/watching opinions or facts. They can sometimes get mixed, like when you learn about amp electronics. Yes, electronics are rather factual to a point. Some rules will always hold true, but different designers and electricians have different methods of achieving same things or same functionality, they also might have different opinions and experiences on what the proper ranges are. For example they might think differently on what voltages and currents are in healthy or useful range. And it's not an absolute thing, for example biasing tubes is to some extent strictly a rule, but in the working range there's plenty of room to bias cold or hot. They provide very different results to ear. For example cold might not sound like a proper amplifier and hot can wear the tubes quickly. \n\nSo don't listen too much to people being absolute about something, rather listen people who tell you how stuff works and why they do it the way they do. If they're absolute, it's usually because safety, yours or the gear's.\n\nEven if this got pinned, I can guarantee you it won't change much. People don't change. The ones who already search answers for their questions are the ones who pay attention to this post, the ones posting the same basic question the 1000th time are gonna happily ignore it. I've seen it in other subs too, with a buttload of resource links directly answering all questions newcomers would have - only to see the same basic questions posted weekly or daily and them answered or directed towards the guides and resources."}, {"comment_id": "etcaldv", "post_id": "caz42c", "comment": "Here is the best advice .

It's easiest to learn that modes are inversions and maybe start with two-note scales/formulas/intervals. All intervals exept the unison interval and the tritone interval have different inversions of it. What are the modes of 12, aka the major second interval? Let's start from C, that makes C and D. There are two notes, so that means two modes. The second mode would be notes D and C, a minor seventh interval. Teaching people things like this is more comprehensive than serving people with patterns. Then people can patternize things for themselves, whether they understand the guitar neck vertically or horizontally.

I think I'd start at the fact that when we go up a fret on our instrument it's called a \"semitone\", which is always the same distance. Going from a distance of 'n' semitones is always going to sound the same.\n\nThen I'd get on to the octave, going up 12 semitones sounds super-special.. doubling of frequency and all that, then mention that it sounds so good that when people decided to give notes names, they gave all notes separated by an octave the same name.\n\nThen I'd ask the question, what notes sound good when we play them together? There are 12 different notes, but most songs only use a subset of these. The most commonly used subset is to choose 7 of these to play, and these 7 are known as the major scale. Then we can describe how to make the major scale in terms of semitones.\n\nOnly after we know about the major scale in terms of semitones would I talk about how the notes are given names based on the major scale. That way it's clear that the names come from the convention, and are not a fundamental part of music.\n\nI guess I like this method because it completely eliminates all mystery about sharps and flats. Also when we come to talk about \"seconds\" (like you did in your post) it's clearer why we need two different types to describe the distances in the major scale.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHowever, what do I know. I think when I learned all this stuff I learned it from an explanation with a similar approach to yours - so maybe it is better and has some benefits which I haven't thought of?

If you want it done well. You might get people saying it's actually really easy and you can do it yourself and yes, you can do it yourself. It would be wise to have someone with experience do it, though. Nut slots can be a sensitive thing to get just right. \n\nIf you're really set on installing it yourself here are a couple tips. Start off with heavy sandpaper. (180, 220, ,etc.) and the flattest surface you can find. Use this to take down the sides to fit it in flush. Go very slowly once you get closer to the width you're looking for. Once you're close, work you're way up to a finer grit sandpaper (400, then 600 and 800). This will get rid of the larger scratch marks from the heavy sandpaper and inch your way to the correct width. Once you've obtained the proper width, use super fine sandpaper (1200, 1500, 2000) to polish up the sides by getting rid of the previous scratch marks. This is all assuming the bottom of the nut fits in the a lot fine. \n\nThat's about it for getting the width. Remember to keep checking and correcting as you sand down material to make sure you stay square. \n\nLet me know if you have any further questions.

I do want to add that I am still very much a beginner in terms of music theory, so apologies if my suggestion seems like a bad one. Here goes:\n\nMy tiny musical brain finds it confusing that your slide doesn\u2019t list flats (b) within a key signature that is flat. I\u2019ve also been grappling with the circle of fifths, which is usually explained (from my limited knowledge) as adding sharps (#) in a clockwise direction, and flats in a counter clockwise direction. I think it would be even greater if your slide worked to reflect the circle of fifths too. This would mean that as you slide counter clockwise (around the fifths wheel), the \u201cF\u201d scale shows a \u201cBb\u201d as its IV rather than an A#, and then so on for the others. If the \u201csignature\u201d box shows \u201cb\u201d, then the scale should show flats rather than sharps.\n\nI also think that should be reflected in the \u201cI\u201d window - Bb, Eb, Ab, Db, rather than A# D# G# C#. For a newbie like me, that seems a bit less confusing, even though they are, obviously, the same notes. \n\nAs I said above, I\u2019m only just getting a grip on music theory, and this is my first attempt, ever, at critiquing anything musical, so apologies if I\u2019ve missed the mark.\n\nI offer these comments because I think your slide is fantastic and, after using it, this discrepancy keeps tripping me up. \n\nThanks again for creating it."}, {"comment_id": "e6xygdk", "post_id": "9f8f47", "comment": "I like this!

Even though the drummer had to help him step up onto the riser at one point, his hands are as nimble as they've ever been. I'm really glad that I was able to see him play, but it leaves a bitter taste knowing that's the reason that I was able to. He came through again this year; I couldn't go, but a friend who did said *he had to wear a colostomy during the entire show.*  I'm not in the best financial situation myself, but I'd be more than willing to pitch in. \n\nCrowdfunding isn't a bad idea, but it's sort of a crapshoot-- a lot of people are pretty cynical towards crowdfunding these days, especially when it concerns a celebrity (obviously it's a much better cause than a new Zac Braff flick, but people can be weird). Plus, even if it raised 50 grand that would only give him a little over a year's worth of retirement before he'd be in the same situation again. It's also not really clear from that quote, but if $3k a month is *just* for medical bills, he's still got to eat and keep the lights on. Don't get me wrong, I think it's a great idea and I'll chip in whatever I can whenever I can... but why stop there? \n\nDude is the fucking King of the Surf Guitar. He is a living legend. There's at least two generations of legit Rock Stars who grew up idolizing him, and they have a lot more disposable income than we do (probably). It would take some organization, but maybe trying to put together a more formal proposal (in addition to a kickstarter-or-similar for us plebs) could help bring in some real money. Maybe Fender, too? It would be a great PR opportunity for them. Somebody on the level of Paul McCartney or Clapton or Bono could afford to help him out for another whole lifetime without flinching. I have no idea how to go about doing something like that, though... I guess it would basically be writing a grant proposal? \n\nThe more I think about it, the more it bothers me that he's in this kind of situation. I think this is a great idea, and I'm glad I clicked on it. Every account I've heard paints him to be an incredibly humble guy who's more than willing to engage with his fans.
