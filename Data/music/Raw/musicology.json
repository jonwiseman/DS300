You can actually just google it and \"Krell Music\" and get a good idea of what a husband and wife team of composers thought music of an alien culture would sound like.\n\nI think most of your \"fantasy\" genre stuff tends to be connected pretty well with our history, and as such a lot of times the music will just sound like \"Early Music\" - Renaissance music, Troubadours and things like that.\n\nI think music-makers are within their rights to assume that any culture that evolves similarly to us (since usually in movies the characters have to be played by actors, at least pre-CGI days) will also evolve instruments similar to us.\n\nThough it may certainly be a little \"western centric\" to assume that they'd develop music less like Africa or Asia, and more like Europe. But since they usually model clothing and everything else again it seems like the logical course.\n\nIt also makes it easier to compose because you don't have to be historically accurate ;-)\n\nI've always found the few examples in the Star Trek universe interesting - Spock's lyre-like instrument - in some of the newer things Klingons sing/chant, and there are references to the music of other species - Klingon Opera I think is mentioned. In Voyager, the Doctor becomes a virtuoso singer for a culture. In a DS9 episode they had a player who played an instrument kind of like what we'd consider Clarinet-like.\n\nBut, Strings, Drums, Pipes, and Metal/Wood - what do we have, Chordophones, Membranophones, Ideophones, Aerophones...am I forgetting one...? Anyway, those sort of basic \"sound making\" physical objects would be likely in any culture.\n\nBut it would be intereting to see how far away you could get from tradition. Wouldn't it be cool for a culture to have a plant with a seed pod that when blown into, produces a note and rattles the seeds at the same time!\n\nOf course I suppose it also depends on how advanced your culture is.\n\nIt would be even more fun to do like alien cultures where they have 3 legs so their \"marches\" are in 3/4 and their dances are in 3! or something."}, {"comment_id": "e2dnep2", "post_id": "8yqdbw", "comment": "The local arts group broadcast an abridged reading of A Wizard of Earthsea and asked me to create some background music for it.\n\nTo a certain extent, I had to do what I was told, but they didn't give me a lot of instructions: they wanted something similar to the Enya songs in LOTR and that there's an overarching concept of light/dark balance, so the music had to portray that somehow.\n\nThe attemps to clone Enya were deleted.\n\nFor the \"balance\" concept, I made rhythms in 7/4. A common thing I noticed in progressive rock music in 7/4 is that if you divide the measure in half, you get two 3.5 beat measures so you have something that sounds syncopated but is balanced at the same time.

That would be important to know their possibilities and limitations when it comes to musical instruments. And, again, what is their environment like? Also consider the diversity of environments on Earth, and that planets that do have life on them will likely show the same kind of diversity of habitat.

So, you'll probably not have \\*\\*one\\*\\* music for one species, just as you don't have one \"human music\" genre or sound, but countless and always-evolving musical genres from many different cultures and subcultures. Obviously, I think if we were to present our species' music to an interstellar gathering, it would probably be classical music, so you could say that's the staple of our music, and other species should also have their \"crowning achievement\", one type of music that they are particularly proud of as a civilization, but keep in mind that it can be the tree that hides the forest."}, {"comment_id": "e2di0wk", "post_id": "8yqdbw", "comment": "Most fantasy worlds like Westeros and Middle Earth tend to imply music that is similar to music from the Middle Ages of this world."}, {"comment_id": "e2dt2bl", "post_id": "8yqdbw", "comment": "For Hyrule I\u2019ve watched videos by GameMusicTheory on YouTube.

There are two sets of opposite tendencies that act on that particular musical style, and when that style is in the middle, it arrives at the top.\n\nThe first set is one of chaos versus order applied to sociology, so marginalised groups and central institutions. The second set is one of complexity versus simplicity, again applied to sociology, which means music specialists versus the masses.\n\nEach type of the eight types of music shown in the graph has its explanation and a few examples.\n\n[The full post detailing each explanation can be found here] (https://yohaciendomeelculto.wordpress.com/2016/12/02/social-hegemony-of-musical-styles/)\n\nThis is the explanation for Industrial Music:\nIndustrial music, on the other hand, is comprised of a set of musical styles that don\u2019t have a social base naturally attached to it. It can acquire it with time, though. It\u2019s comprised by forms of music that are created mainly for the purpose of making money, or providing a service. Musical scores for movies or video games are the main examples. Music for television shows, announcements, or trailers. Sometimes, if the institutions and atmospheres that comprise this way of music making are sane and powerful enough, they can attract individuals from the creator minority that produce music of great quality able to connect to a wide audience. Examples of this kind of phenomenon are great and famous film composers like Hans Zimmer or John Williams, whose compositions are able to transcend their primary capitalist functions and become cultural icons, like the Star Wars themes, between many other movies. Another example is the style of what was known firstly as \u2018industrial\u2019 music per se, and now called popularly \u2018epic\u2019 music, which is a style that existed in the shadows for a long time, comprised of production tracks and sounds sold to movie trailers and TV series. They took classical music harmony and orchestral wisdom and applied it very successfully with modern techniques, creating a very advanced and genius style of music, which caught on with lots of music-loving people outside the entertainment industry. The main example of this style is the group Two Steps From Hell."}, {"comment_id": "ebw3o45", "post_id": "a6k2w6", "comment": "Cool.

Many of the compositional trends of the Baroque (opera and the concertato style) actually repudiated complex polyphony, but counterpoint was kept alive largely because of its pedagogic usefulness.  Composers like Schutz recognized the need for a firm grounding in counterpoint, even if one's compositional efforts were more homophonic.  This sentiment would survive even into the late 19th Century, when Brahms's most common suggestion to would-be students was to study counterpoint thoroughly."}, {"comment_id": "d2q6egi", "post_id": "4hjhcb", "comment": "You might get additional answers over in /r/classicalmusic \n\nA lot of film composition pulls in a very \"Wagnerian\" sound world. So I think that anyone who was a contemporary of Wagner or who came later could hear movie themes and feel fairly comfortable with the musical language. \n\nHowever, 18th century musicians would have had a much different idea of what a melodic line should do, how it should be harmonized, and what instrumentation would work well with it. As an example, let's think about the [\"Force Theme\"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1gpXMGit4P8) from Star Wars. Now there's a lot about the melodic line that would work in an eighteenth century context, but a lot would need to change about how the line is treated to bring it in line with eighteenth century aesthetics. \n\nTo illustrate what I mean, I have turned the basic melodic line of the force theme into an idiomatic eighteenth century \"ritornello\" (which is the music that an orchestra would play before a singer's entrance in an aria).\n\n[[midi mockup](https://soundcloud.com/nmitchell076/force-theme-ritornello) | [score](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9wYtm5NwTTVc3FoX0pRV1kyejA/view?usp=sharing)]\n\nThe first 7 seconds I pulled from the first 7 seconds of the force theme, though I alter the melodic figuration, give a full orchestral harmonization rather than the \"eerie strings\" of the recording, and repeat the last bit.\n\nThe next bit (from :7-12) is wholly my own. I just couldn't find a way to work the stuff from :7-:12 of the actual force theme into something that sounded convincing and stylistic.  An eighteenth century musician would have most likely moved onto a new idea here, whereas Williams lingers on the first idea a bit more. So I decided to try to stick with the eighteenth century mindset and do something new.\n\nThe rest of it is all Williams' melody, which I harmonized and repeated in certain ways that makes more sense to the eighteenth century.\n\nHopefully that example gives you a good sense of where eighteenth and 20th century \"thinking\" in music is similar and where it is different."}, {"comment_id": "d2qilly", "post_id": "4hjhcb", "comment": "Short answer: No. \n\nA modern orchestra does use mostly (not all) of the instruments that Mozart would have had available.

Though since the 1990's a vast amount of scholars have taken a different and largely sociological/anthropological approach and generally accepted, that we simply did not have the neccessary set of terms to describe the creative/cultural value of popular music. The result of these post-90's writings have produced extensive writings about for example how popular music was a major player in the creation of gay and queer identity in the 70's or how woman used the masculine power of rock-music as a feminist tool. To discuss the value of popular music usually requires one to extend your thoughts further than a classic empirical analysis of the music in question. I'm really glad that my university offers a lot of classes to discuss the aesthetics and value of popular music, because I have had the exact same thoughts as you, and I have really been challenged to try and think differently about how I discuss music. Here are some introductional writings on the topic (sorry for long links, these chapters aren't always easy to find) \n[Simon Frith, towards an Aesthetic of Popular music](https://books.google.dk/books?id=ZFBUsDpDTx4C&pg=PA257&lpg=PA257&dq=simon+frith+towards+an+aesthetic+of+popular+music+online&source=bl&ots=OVXnbYW675&sig=KtBF2FyqJ40wd0oZSyUxgjOel_Y&hl=da&sa=X&ei=KAZjVaygH4H1Ur6QgKAD&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=simon%20frith%20towards%20an%20aesthetic%20of%20popular%20music%20online&f=false)\nor\nCarl Wilson, \"Let's talk about love: Why other people have such bad taste\".

One of my favorites is comparing it to food. \n\nPop music would be the equivalent of McDonalds, while high art composers would equate to a 3 Michelin Star restaurant. Can we really say that one is better than the other? No. We can't. There is no objective measurement by which we can compare them. However, I think most people in their right mind would say that a fine restaurant is better than fast food. So what makes it better?\n\nFast food is cheap and made for quick assembly. The aim of fast food restaurants is to feed as many people as possible as efficiently as possible. The food is oversaturated with salty flavors, as they know that this is what we crave, and thus it makes the food much more marketable and appealing to almost everyone. Not only that, it lacks care. I don't think any upcoming chefs who are passionate about food are working in the kitchen of a McDonalds right now. \n\nIn a fine restaurant, the ingredients are all very high quality. The recipes take time, effort and attention. In this food the flavors are much more subtle and sophisticated. Not every dish is meant to appeal to every person. And most of all, there is a sort of craft-like care that goes into making every dish.\n\nFor me, these features carry over into music. Popular music tends to lack care, and is cheap, made from the same sounds that we are shown to like, and its aim is to appeal to as many people as possible. Art music is for a narrower audience, but provides an experience that pop music can't. \n\nHowever, this is just my opinion, and it is different for everyone!"}, {"comment_id": "ctfcptn", "post_id": "3efis8", "comment": "This type of debate is usually referred to in important music circles as \"total shitty elitist bullshit\". \n\nWTF does \"artistic\" even mean? \n\nThis is the kind of debate had by people who have zero real experience in one or the other field.

It's a stupid distinction. \n\nI refuse to believe that \"The Juliet Letters\" is inherently superior to \"This Year's Model\" just because one sounds like \"art music\" and one doesn't.

Art music is, to me, music that has a lot of subtle and hidden moments that would not be heard if you weren't giving it your attention. There are plenty of pop songs like this so it's not a hard division. Music that is meant to be listened to in an intimate setting is Art music to me. That can be lots of different kinds of music of course. But think about yourself sitting in the dark listening to the music in question, is it touching or hilarious?

In order for your comparison to work, you would have to find people who are using instruments from a certain period, fx. the 50s, in order to perform music written during the 50s, on instruments from the 50s, with 50s technique, in order to get as close as possible to the sound of that era.

The instrument's primary role was simply to double the melody, but it would occasionally venture into playing different notes.  Greek music theory does not tell us much about this sort of polyphony, except that it could involve \"exotic\" intervals like major or minor thirds, as well as quasi-'consonant' (most likely septimal) tritones and minor sevenths.

Specifically I looked at brass playing, and more specifically, trumpet playing.  I actually studied the \"other\" kind of brass multiphonics, split-tones, as part of my qualification exams, but singing-and-playing was always in my periphery.\n\nThere was an explosion of study on extended techniques in the late 1960s, at least partly because of Bruno Bartolozzi's popular [New Sounds for Woodwind](http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-sounds-for-woodwind/oclc/602163294).  Unfortunately for trumpet players, generating multiphonics with two or more fundamentals using our tiny lip-reed + resonator systems wasn't as easy as with woodwinds, or with larger brass instruments.  Instead, a lot of players and their composers adopted singing-and-playing \"multiphonics\" as an easier substitute to get weird timbres with beating, etc (if you sing below the pitch you are playing on a trumpet, the deconstructive interference seems to be much more pronounced, hence, beating).  This technique was so prevalent in trumpet extended technique books that the word \"multiphonics\" is almost always associated with \"singing-and-playing\" in that literature.\n\nConversely, on trombone, multiple-fundamental multiphonics generated solely with the lip-reed + resonator system (the lips and the instrument), \"split-tones,\" have been more accepted and widely used, perhaps because the larger mouthpiece accommodates multiple buzz-points easier.  You can actually see this in high speed video of [Stuart Dempster's lips](https://youtu.be/gmBDG_wAeS4?t=3m31s).\n\nIt wasn't until recently that \"split-tones\" have been more widely adopted by trumpet players.  Perhaps we all just got over our fear of ruining our embouchure after Peter Evans released [Nature/Culture](http://www.newmusicbox.org/articles/Sounds-Heard-Peter-Evans-Nature-Culture/).\n\nAnyway, with \"split-tones\" aside, my favorite trumpet work involving singing-and-playing actually involves a kind of ventriloquism, whereby the trumpet player sings in and around (mostly around) around his or her playing: [Kryl](https://youtu.be/XrVp7fubzo4).  Interestingly this had a lot to do with the premiere performer's ([Ed Harkins](http://www.harkinslarsonthe.com/)) interest in the actual practice of ventriloquism.\n\nTL;DR: On trumpet, singing-and-playing has been frequently considered an easier alternative to split-tone multiphonics, primarily for the purpose of timbral expansion, rather than for adding a musical voice to the texture."}, {"comment_id": "cq2qjo9", "post_id": "2z5ju4", "comment": "It's great to see another person that has studied Historical Performance on here (I'm a Baroque violinist)!

I think a lot of musicologists pursue an instrument as the \"other\" thing. I understand that impulse, but sometimes I think they choose that because it is the \"obvious\" one. If you can instead invest that time into developing a related skill, then perhaps that might translate into some sort of career path outside of the Academy. \n\nIn my own case, I spent a lot of time getting my graphics for my papers to look really nice, and transcribing a bunch of scores, trying to learn the ins and outs of notation programs along the way.

By that, I mean that a base-line amount of vibrato (or spin, as it's also called) is produced without any explicit intention.

That said, singers can modify or even remove the vibrato, but (at least for me) that takes more work than allowing my voice to produce it's natural spin.  (This is specific to singing in a classical context of course.  If I'm just singing quietly to myself or if I'm singing into a mic, I might not always employ the classical technique, and thus might not produce that natural vibrato.)\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIt's hard to really explain without teaching you that singing technique and allowing it to just \"happen\" so you can feel it.

Just look at The Philips Pavilion which he designed in '58 (I think). He was almost a part of the legendary Nadia Boulanger school, but ultimately unable to study with her and other teachers at the time who looked down on his particular methods of music (Wikipedia notes \"As Xenakis recounted in a 1987 interview, Honegger dismissed a piece which included parallel fifths and octaves as 'not music'\"). \n\nMessaien describes it well noting that \"I understood straight away that he was not someone like the others. [...] He is of superior intelligence. [...] I did something horrible which I should do with no other student, for I think one should study harmony and counterpoint. But this was a man so much out of the ordinary that I said... No, you are almost thirty, you have the good fortune of being Greek, of being an architect and having studied special mathematics. Take advantage of these things. Do them in your music.\" (again cited from Wikipedia). \n\nThis is a musician who possesses an understanding of music that is so out of line with the history and theoretical understanding that even the avant-garde cats are distinct from him. Schoenberg notes that he saw his methodology of tone row compositions as finishing what Bach had started (in reference to thematic transfiguration, fragmentation, and alteration). Reich falls into obsession with phasing to obscenely precise levels. Even Messaien's modes of limited transposition are analyses within symmetric scalar constructions. As much math and set theory is implemented into these theories, the roots are music. Xenakis flips this, rooting his works in architecture and mathematics, applying it to music. \n\nIn the same way that an engineer constructs a bridge, Xenakis constructs his works, independent from constraints of traditional notation, 12TET restrictions, or even influences of counterpoint rules, or harmonic trends over the last 2000 years. A lot of people note the distinction of the French, Italian, and particularly Germanic schools of music leading out of the 19th and into the 20th century of composition. Xenakis is independent of those as a result of his unique background and approach and personal history. Schoenberg \"emancipated the dissonance\" in the 20th century, but did Xenakis even care about consonance and dissonance? His structural and (having not studied in depth, I take a leap at potentially using this term wrong) stochastic music is not contingent on the same things that people are used to listening for.\n\nI've been meaning to read Xenakis's Book \"Formalized Music Thought and Mathematics in Composition\" for some time, so this quote is a bit out of context, but Xenakis notes his basic temporary hypothesis (lemma) of Markovian Stochastic music theory saying that:\n\n\"All sound is an integration of grains, of elementary sonic particles, of sonic quanta. Each of these elementary grains has a threefold nature: duration, frequency, and intensity. All sound, even all continuous sonic variation, is conceived as an assemblage of a large number of elementary grains adequately disposed in time. So every sonic complex can be analyzed as a series of pure sinusoidal sounds even if the variations of these sinusoidal sounds are infinitely close, short, and complex. In the attack, body, and decline of a complex sound, thousands of pure sounds appear in a more or less short interval of time, \u2206t. Hecatombs of pure sounds are necessary for\nthe creation of a complex sound. A complex sound may be imagined as a multi-colored firework in which each point of light appears and instantaneously disappears against a black sky. But in this firework there would be such a quantity of points oflight organized in such a way that their rapid and teeming succession would create forms and spirals, slowly unfolding, or conversely, brief explosions setting the whole sky aflame. A line of light would be created by a sufficiently large multitude of points appearing and disappearing instantaneously.\"\n\nHe's not finding clever alterations or interpretations of V-I , he's delicately making an aural structure.\n\nTo engage with this unique viewpoint of music, you need sympathy, and focus, and engagement, because this is a man with a painful life, composing music with methods far distinct from anyone else, that has an independence from conceptions of tonal music that previous and contemporary composers did not strive for. \n\nBut, hey these are just random thoughts, so take everything I said with a grain of salt."}, {"comment_id": "ekxai0u", "post_id": "9y194g", "comment": "The basso continuo is also clear testament to the role improvisation played in Western music until quite recently.

Modern instruments are built to far more exact specifications and we use technology (not to mention a universal pitch standard) to get them in tune.

As long as you're getting your classwork done, spending time outside your discipline is good. It's how most important scholars make their marks. The term you're missing is \"interdisciplinarity.\"\n\nA currently hot trend in music studies (more theory than -ology, but all the same) is metaphor theory, which is based largely on linguistics.

Musical semiotics is founded on semiotics generally, which is more or less (mostly more) based on linguistics alla Saussure and Russian formalists. I work on genre quite a bit and a huge part of genre theory in all disciplines is based on linguistics, particularly morphology.\n\n>Something that made me curious was whether or not the type of music a musician plays or listens to also influences the way they think- perhaps about music in general or a deeper fundamental cognitive process.\n\nI'm not sure, but it's possible, and likely shapes the way you think about music, at least.

Absolutely. Should we think outside of the box in terms of how we define and classify music? Of course. There are lots of things music studies as a whole could learn from the social sciences and other academic disciplines, and I think we are seeing some trends in the direction of interdisciplinary studies and use of techniques and methods from diverse fields to approach problems within music studies, and I think that\u2019s a good thing.

These are often vague to identify in music, as often they do not correspond to units of classical music analysis. They can be a single chord, or maybe a wide-encompassing texture, melodic shape, use of specific instrument in a context, etc. How Tagg analyses what music \"means\" is through IOCM - Inter-Objective-Comparison-Material. Meaning - seeing how similar structures of music have been given meaning in our culture historically. (Hence the comparison with The Rite, Psycho, soul music, etc.) To establish these, Tagg often interviews peoples first impressions on given music and attempts to find culturally shared categories of interpretation. Further he develops a sign-typology of these musemes, he has coined the term \"anaphone\" (musical analogue) to describe different types of signs - indexical (referring signs) such as style, genre and cultural anaphones (synecdoche) or iconic anaphones (based on resemblance, such as the \"bustling\" of the market in the strings, musical echos connoting spaciousness etc). \n\nFor a more academically presented analysis, I believe he has written on Kojak in \"Ten Little Tunes\" https://books.google.ee/books/about/Ten_Little_Title_Tunes.html?id=WXF-QgAACAAJ&redir_esc=y\n\nAn introductory article on music semiotics coined by him is available here: https://www.tagg.org/xpdfs/semiotug.pdf\n\nAnd a rather extensive e-book serving the same purpose is freely available here: http://tagg.org/bookxtrax/NonMuso/NonMusoAll.pdf\n\nFurther I'll note that though Tagg is a respected scholar in music semiotics and serves as a pretty accessible intro, he by no means characterizes the field as a whole, as it is quite heterogeneous.

There are some downright hilarious recordings of songs by John Dowland and others where the singer employs a decidedly modern, bel canto, blastissimo vocal style, for music that was essentially the pop songs of the day.

Most people don't publish until well into their graduate career. Many don't see a publication until after their dissertation is completed. \n\n> Will it be possible to continue to perform (violist here!) or should I only focus on research? \n\nAlmost certainly. But of course different places will have different opportunities. But, in general, if you want to perform, your program will facilitate it. \n\nNow, for a longer, more detailed response. \n\nFirst of all, I think writing samples are potentially the most important part of your application. Think about what your papers say about you (can you analyze music? Can you critically digest / respond to scholarly literature? Etc.) and of course edit them well. \n\nSecondly, develop a good relationship with any musicologists in your department. They can guide you toward good schools, they can write letters on your behalf, and they may even know a guy who knows a guy, which can help your case as well. But even just getting a good letter of recommendation is good. You will want to have three contacts. When I applied to grad school for theory, I had a mentor who was an adjunct and just getting done with his dissertation. My letters came from my theory professor, the head of the composition department (who I had taken some classes with), and my piano teacher. \n\nYour personal statement needs to do three things. 1) Provide a concise picture of your scholarly interests, 2) demonstrate your relevant achievements / academic competency (who you've worked with, what you've done, **and preemptively responding to anything in your transcript that might have them raising their eyebrows**), and 3) explain why you are interested in that school in particular (be specific!). These three things serve one larger purpose: proving to the school why they should consider you as a candidate. \n\nNumbers 1 and 2 can remain relatively consistent across your applications, but number 3 will of course have to change. Let's linger here a moment. Of course you're applying to Yale because IT'S YALE (prestige and that sweet Ivy league stipend), but you of course can't just say that. Neither will blatant flattery work, they know that their institution rocks, they need to know why *you* belong there. So here's how you handle it: go to the website of the school, find scholars that actually do work relevant to what you do, read an article or two by them, and then write about how your work relates to theirs. \n\nSaying \"I want to be a student at Yale because Yale is great for x y and z reasons\" isn't a strong statement. Saying \"I would like to study with James Hepokoski because of his interest in dialogic understandings of musical experience. My work intersects with his in x y and z ways, and I am interested in applying that work in the study of 17th century opera.\" That is a strong statement. That shows that you are not just a generic student, but that your research interests actually resonate with the school in question, and consequently that you would mesh well with the faculty. \n\nPerforming this exercise for every school will be a lot, but it'll be worth it. Not only would you be writing significantly better personal statements, but researching who is at these schools will give you a better understanding of where you would fit the best. If you look at the Yale faculty, you read a couple of articles by the faculty there, and you find yourself completely uninterested in anything they're saying, then you might want to reconsider applying there in the fist place! Save yourself the application fee. \n\nAlso, if you find something you are interested in / have some further questions after reading, drop the author an email. Scholars are often very excited to discuss their work, and it can't hurt you to have a contact in the schools you are applying. \n\nSo, in sum. Do three things in this order of importance:\n\n1.) Write good papers that demonstrate your competency and range of interests. \n\n2.) Develop a good relationship with any musicology faculty in your department to secure some decent letters of recommendation and to have someone to help guide you. \n\n3.) Write a good personal statement that paints you as a specific person with specific interests. Avoid generic statements like the plague.
