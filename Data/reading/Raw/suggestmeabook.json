If you like it, you can read the rest. :) I've re-read Sabriel a lot at different points in my life, and it holds up even as an adult. \n\n**Most anything by Dianna Wynn Jones** \\- I loved (LOVED LOVED) the **Chrestomanci series** in particular, but **Howl's Moving Castle** was also great, and I loved the **Dalemark Quartet** books. I haven't re-read these so I don't know how they hold up, but she's really great at having books in a series that seem unrelated to each other or only loosely related and then - BAM, they all tie into something bigger. So good. \n\n**The Blue Sword** is also an old favorite of mine, written by Robin McKinley. I don't really like her newer works as much, but she did a lot of fantasy/re-told fairy tales, and they were enjoyable/satisfying. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Still part of the former category but with some reservations:**\n\nLeigh Bardugo's **Grisha trilogy** is ok - I had mixed feelings about it, but think it might have been because I was a touch out of the age range for it when I read it. BUT - **her duology set in the same universe after is AMAZING** and almost feels like a different writer somehow (**Six of Crows**, and the sequel, **Crooked Kingdom**). Having read the initial trilogy gave me more background for terms and concepts, and it allowed me to enjoy the easter eggs and call backs as well. I think you could probably just read Six of Crows and Crooked Kingdom if you only wanted to read one of the sets. :) Satisfying.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Not exactly like Harry Potter but still very good fantasy:**\n\n**Blood Song** by Anthony Ryan is the beginning of a fantasy series that I haven't finished, but it was fun on its own (the sequel was enjoyable too, but I don't remember much from it). Not one that I've reread, but I enjoyed the experience of reading it the first time. Surprisingly quick read - could have used some editing (I think it was initially self published), but still pretty good. Read like a mix of YA and Adult fantasy.\n\nI also really loved the **Lord of the Rings**, as well as **the Hobbit**, but they have a different \"feel\" from Harry Potter imo. They have magic, and an epic battle between good and evil, and an incredibly rich world to step into so I do recommend them in general - just not as a direct comparison to HP. I remember I really loved The Hobbit right away, but it took me a little bit to warm up to Lord of the Rings as a kid. As an adult though, it is in my top five favorite series. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Finally, a blind recommendation based on recommendations I received:** I'm reading it right now, so I don't know how satisfying the ending will be, or how I'll be left feeling in general, but I've had extremely strong recommendations for the **Mistborn** series from friends based on my reading preferences.

That being said, I liked A Song of Ice and Fire but I hated the constantly shifting point of view. I would never re-read this series. One and done. I re-read HP about once a year.  The series that got me started on fantasy at a young age was Lloyd Alexander\u2019s Chronicles of Prydain. Borrows heavily on Welsh mythology.  Much shorter series, but delightful characters and development over the series.  Do NOT let the Disney animated version of the second book (The Black Cauldron) have ANY bearing in your decision. Lol. Horrible adaptation.  I also re-read this series\u2014though not as frequently as HP. If you liked Rowling\u2019s writing style, she also writes an absolutely fantastic mystery series under the pseudonym Robert Galbraith. The main character, Cormoran Strike, puts me in the mind of Hagrid if he were a muggle.  Maybe that\u2019s because I\u2019ve listened to the audiobooks and the narrator makes Strike\u2019s voice very Hagrid-ish.

George R.R.

And this is what GRRM is able to balance beautifully. \n\nI feel like I have just enough information to understand the world he's describing before he transitions back into plot. And the transitions are absolutely seamless, btw. It's really refreshing to read fantasy the way he writes it! \n\nShould you watch the show first? Eh... maybe. I saw the show first, and it did help me remember who each character is, because there are A LOT of characters. But definitely don't watch too much before reading. I'd recommend maybe the first few episodes. After that, if you feel comfortable reading the rest, do that, and then you could maybe finish the show later. \n\nBut I will warn you, GRRM hasn't finished the series yet, and the end of the show was not entirely satisfying.

I\u2019ve always been partial to that series; it\u2019s a personal favourite of mine, and I was known throughout most of elementary as \u201cthat girl who\u2019s obsessed with Harry Potter\u201d, so I love it when other people read the books! Means I have other people to nerd out with\ud83d\ude0a\nAnyways, here are some recommendations:\n\nPercy Jackson series by Rick Riordan - they\u2019re like Harry Potter in that they\u2019re set in the real world, but instead of witches and wizards, it\u2019s Greek Mythology. He\u2019s written other series that revolve around mythology and are set in the same world as the original series as well; Heroes of Olympus (Greek and Roman), Kane Chronicles (Egyptian), Trials of Apollo (more Greek), Magnus Chase (Norse). However, the original series, Percy Jackson and the Olympians, is the best one. \n\nThrone of Glass series by Sarah J Maas - imagine the Hunger Games, Harry Potter, Game of thrones, with a little bit of Percy Jackson, and a shit ton of assassins all came together to create a series. It\u2019s glorious. However, it\u2019s a pretty complicated storyline, and there are seven books and a collection of novellas, so it\u2019s a lot to get through, but worth it!"}, {"comment_id": "eufj70b", "post_id": "cg294l", "comment": "The lord of the rings"}, {"comment_id": "eufj878", "post_id": "cg294l", "comment": "Please check out the Artemis Fowl series!"}, {"comment_id": "eufjnxi", "post_id": "cg294l", "comment": "Anything written by Rick Riordan, honestly.

Mass is an EXCELLENT book. The two that follow it and it's short story are no different.\n\nAlso, Fablehaven by Brandon Mull is a fantastic series and really has the magic, mystery, and adventure air that HP does.\n\nThe Mysterious Benedict Society by Trenton Lee Stewart is such a fun read, and while not magical it's more puzzling and really draws you in with it's lovable kids and crazy stories.\n\nThe Maze Runner by James Dashner is a fictional classic and just tears your heart out with how well it's written. Never fails to keep your attention and the characters and futuristic setting are fascinating.\n\nSplintered by A.G. Howard is an Alice in Wonderland inspired book, but wow if the author didn't make it their own. Between the love triangle and whimsical (and a little scary) world of Wonderland, you will never have a full moment with this book.\n\nCinder by Marissa Meyer is another fairytale inspired book series, set in a future world with twists and turns everywhere. The characters are so loveable and it really plays on different ideas of acceptance and fitting in and what's right.\n\nThe Testing by Joelle Charbonneau is fascinating is the sense that the world Charbonneau created is so wild and strict at the same time. The main character is someone you want to be your best friend and she is so smart and the book itself is just amazing.\n\nCaraval by Stephanie Garner is soooooo good. It combines the whimsy of a circus with the realness of life amazingly well and has that same mystical feel that Harry Potter does.\n\nThe Belles by Dhionelle Clayton is just WOW. It plays on ideas of inner beauty and government corruption and it just combines that with this new type of magic so so well.\n\nEdit: added more books"}, {"comment_id": "eufkgq7", "post_id": "cg294l", "comment": "If you've ever played the Halo games or like scifi, the books are pretty good.

It was called Guts and it was so horrible that it was rejected with cries of extreme nausea by every publisher to whom it was presented. Langford dined out on the story for years, and professed (pseudo-) sorrow that nobody would ever read the rotten thing.*\n\n  \n*Well now you can. Cosmos Books have taken the plunge and published it - thus proving yet again that there is no subject matter so vile that the book can't find a publisher somewhere.*\n\n  \n*The \"plot\" (for want of a better word) revolves around the exploits of the sentient intestines of the major characters. The intestines rather resent their interior functions. They want to break out into the world, to live and love in the open air. (It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase \"communicating with your inner being\"). The bulk of the novel is made up of a series of set piece encounters between the rampant intestines and the populace at large.*\n\n  \n*Every intestinal joke you can think of and huge number that you can't think of and many that you wouldn't like to think of desecrate the text along with a lot of sly nudge, nudge, wink, wink digs at pseudo-scientific nut-cults, the reading room of the British Library and the sexual attractiveness of the Sphinx.

Some others that I love that may have some similaries:\n\n* the *Divergent* series by Veronica Roth. Compared to HG a lot. Also dystopian, 3 books, set in a world where people are separated into factions by their personalities.\n* the *Uglies* series by Scott Westerfeld. Also dystopian, people are ugly until they reach a certain age and become pretty.\n* *The Giver* by Lois Lowry. Standalone book with a similar theme of a child fighting against a dystopian society.\n* The *Unwind* series by Neal Schusterman is a dystopian about a world in which abortion is now illegal in favor of a process called unwinding. This may be slightly mature for 11, but it could also spark a great conversation about women's rights and the pro-life/pro-choice conflict if you've not yet discussed it.\n* *The Diviners* series by Libba Bray. Not dystopian, but super fun - set in 1920s New York City about teenagers with supernatural powers. There's three books with a fourth and final one on the way next year.\n* *The Book Thief* by Marcus Zusak was a favorite of mine in middle school. It's a Holocaust novel narrated by Death. I highly recommend it because of its beautiful writing style and heartwrenching plot.\n* The *May Bird* trilogy by Jodi Lynn Anderson is a little less mature than the others on the list, but still one of my all-time favorites (and I'm 21 now). It's about a girl named May Bird who is transported to the land of the dead and needs to defeat the evil overlord and escape. So, not a dystopian, but if she likes ghosts she'd probably love it.\n* Finally, a bit of an oddball possibly, but *Flowers for Algernon* by Daniel Keyes is a great read. It may be a little mature for her still (I vaguely remember mild sexual themes) but it's about a developmentally stunted man who undergoes an experiment to become intelligent. We read the shortened version in eighth grade and I read the full length novel a few weeks later, so I would have been 13 or 14. Maybe give it a read first if you think she'd like it to determine whether she's ready for it.\n\nGood luck!

(It\u2019s been some time since I read the series last but a look on google will help fill the gaps). \n\n- Matched (series) in which your soulmate is decided for you. However, the mc ends up with two and has to fight for what she loves. Rebellion has a somewhat large part from what I remember that is against the use of having soulmates being chosen. \n\n- Stung (series) is where the mc is one of the last females alive and must survive in a world where a virus has wiped out most females and any females left are taken, harmed, and forced to make babies. She disguised as a male to hide her identity. Might be a little graphic, but it was a good read (have only read book 1 and 2)\n\n\nThese are some of the few I could name off of the top of my head but are good, worthwhile reads.

He also examines the revolving door in prison and hospitals and sees that a large population of those in prison or homeless have mental illnesses. \n\nIt\u2019s a really, really, really good read.

Make sure you keep your grades up, work in research labs on campus, find relevant volunteer opportunities, and pick your top 5 grad schools early so you will be prepared when it's time to apply.  \n\n\nIf you haven't started school yet at all, and the intersection of police and mental illness is something that is important to you, a transferrable associate's degree in criminal justice from a community college may be an option for you. It's also a good place to network with future law enforcement professionals, future attorneys, and others who may start their careers around the same time or slightly sooner than you (a lot of police officers just get the associate's degree, while aspiring attorneys still have to get through law school).  \n\n\nAlso, look into the field of forensic psychology/legal psychology. I had several psychology professors who have served as expert witnesses in the court system, and I even had the opportunity to take a course about the intersections of psychology and the law. My main professor who taught in this area got a Bachelor's in psychology and then completed a graduate degree that consisted of basically the first two (out of three) years of law school. I did not go the same route, so I don't know the exact details of these programs, but I thought it was a pretty cool option. Here is a link with more info on this career field:  [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/witness/201409/forensic-psychology-is-it-the-career-me](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/witness/201409/forensic-psychology-is-it-the-career-me)   \n\n\nAn MSW is also an option, if you want to work either in direct advocacy or public policy. Having a master's degree or higher adds clout to your name in the field, and in a lot of ways frees you to design your own career field based directly on your interests and desires. You mention wanting to do something that seems along the lines of \"sensitivity training\" (not sure if they still call it that). With the right degrees and certifications, you could write all your own materials and run your own business. This is very similar to a goal I have, except I want to educate teachers on how to identify signs of abuse and mental illness in students. I'm currently trying to get into grad school so I can get started down that career path (sadly I am not qualified to teach teachers with just my BA in Psychology, even though I know very intimately what it looks like to be a kid with mental illness)."}, {"comment_id": "exy21qe", "post_id": "cuke6x", "comment": "I've been a mentor for vulnerable people in prisons for a good few years, go in with no assumptions, eyes wide open, and simply do your best"}, {"comment_id": "exy4ua2", "post_id": "cuke6x", "comment": "Yes!!

For example, as it regards drug use, I recommend Chasing the Scream by Johann Hari and Never Enough by Judith Grisel. As well, a book like How to Change Your Mind by Michael Pollan is excellent for thinking about how drugs that are normally maligned are actually therapeutic. \n\nWith something like psychosis, I am looking for more information about that myself, but A Very Short Introduction to Schizophrenia by Chris Frith lays good groundwork and has additional recommendations in the back of the book. \n\nFinally I think it is important to learn and think about how our minds work, what they are for. For this I recommend Descartes\u2019 Error and The Feeling of What Happens, both by Antonio Damasio. By gaining neuroscientific insights as well as philosophical insight, then a path toward education may emerge. \n\nGood luck on your journey.

I work in mental health in Portland, OR, and this is a HUGE problem here. The James Chasse case is much-discussed; I\u2019d recommend a documentary film about it, *Alien Boy*, and see where that takes you. I\u2019d also look into [NAMI](https://www.nami.org), especially their [crisis intervention training](https://www.nami.org/get-involved/law-enforcement-and-mental-health), and the [Hearing Voices Network ](http://www.intervoiceonline.org/)and any resources that they recommend. They\u2019re both amazing, grassroots, peer-led. \n\nThat said, and noting that I chose the same course for my life and we\u2019re THRILLED to have you\u2014if I knew then what I know now, I\u2019d either be sure to commit to a PhD or PsyD, or I\u2019d do law. Folks struggling with mental health need good (pro-bono) lawyers in addition to needing good social workers & practitioners, and speaking for myself & my Master\u2019s-level salary, when my kid got sick & needed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of care that insurance didn\u2019t cover, I wished with all my heart that I\u2019d chosen a more lucrative path. I\u2019m sure you hear that a LOT, and I\u2019m sorry. It\u2019s just\u2014damn, the economy sucks, and when I chose to commit my life to the macro, I didn\u2019t quite know how important and desperate the micro would be. \n\n& just so that my reply is vaguely subreddit-appropriate...hmmm. The last industry book that sucked me in was *Conflict is Not Abuse* By Sarah Schulman, and although it\u2019s more sociological than psychological, and it\u2019s not about cops, HEY YO they should all read it, although if I get started on everything that cops should do, you\u2019ll never get rid of me.\n\nBest of luck!!!

Her family were Hmong refugees from the Vietnam war who didn\u2019t speak any English. They believed her epilepsy was caused by the spirits, and their eventual refusal to follow Western medical practices lead to her removal from their home. It is an incredible, multi-layered story.

This was the first book I\u2019ve found that\u2019s exclusively about BPD and it\u2019s helped me immensely. The only thing that bugs me about the book is that the perspectives it takes is the extremes of any scenario it gives. \n\n\nBPD used to be classified as a schizophrenic disorder (cluster A) and it\u2019s very much not. It was reclassified in the late 80\u2019s/early 90\u2019s as cluster B- personality disorders. It\u2019s already a hard enough thing to pin down (no professional will even try to diagnose until you\u2019re at least 18, usually early 20\u2019s), but add to that one hell of a stigma and, well, you\u2019re just throwing gas on a trash fire. \n\n\nLike I said, it\u2019s hard to pin, BPD borders on everything that makes up cluster B and is *VERY* often misdiagnosed. Bipolar is quite commonly confused with it, as are narcissistic or antisocial personality disorders. The book is very good at pointing out the differences and and how to discern what actually IS borderline personality disorder. \n\n\nHow it can also help if you have LEO ideals, is that obviously mental illness runs rampant in jails and prisons. I\u2019m a correctional officer for going on 12 years and have worked every level of Corrections but federal. Being a psych patient myself has majorly helped me deal with inmates because I can relate (namast-cray), and these guys are CONSTANTLY lumped together on a select few medications and under a select few diagnoses, and a loooooot of them have BPD, but none of them are diagnosed with it. The book even goes into some of that. \n\n\nSeriously, the book is brilliant and has put so much in perspective for me. Don\u2019t necessarily take the books extreme examples completely to heart, but the information is invaluable and undiagnosed/misdiagnosed BPD is *RAMPANT* in the system."}, {"comment_id": "exz76km", "post_id": "cuke6x", "comment": "Neurotic Styles\u00a0by David Shapiro\n\n\nAbout different forms of neurosis, and an incredible author.

My last bout with depression took a lot out of me. I lost interest in everything that I used to love. I've slowly moved back into some of it but it's taken time. I still don't get the enjoyment from cooking that I used to and part of that is because I tried to push back into too fast. Take your time. Find something fun and self-contained. I think the suggestion of Stardust by Neil Gaiman is a great one. Good Omens by him and Terry Pratchett could also be good. I believe Good Omens is longer so it might be a better second book.

The 7th book in the series just released and it is full of laugh out loud moments and antics, all while holding a fun storyline in place. Here is the basic synopsis from Amazon for Book #1:  \n\n\n \n\nTim and his friends find out the hard way that you shouldn't question the game master, and you shouldn't make fun of his cape.\n\nOne minute, they're drinking away the dreariness of their lives, escaping into a fantasy game and laughing their asses off. The next minute, they're in a horse-drawn cart surrounded by soldiers pointing crossbows at them.\n\nTim now has the voice and physique of a prepubescent girl. Dave finds that while he lost a foot or two in height, he somehow acquired a suit of armor and a badass beard. Julian's ears have grown ridiculously long and pointy. And Cooper... well Cooper has gotten himself a set of tusks, a pair of clawed hands, and a bad case of the shits. He also finds that he's carrying a bag with a human head in it - a head that he had chopped off when they were still just playing a game.\n\nShit just got real, and if they want to survive, these four friends are going to have to tap into some baser instincts they didn't even know existed in their fast-food and pizza delivery world.\n\nIt's fight, flight, or try to convince the people who are trying to kill them that they don't really exist."}, {"comment_id": "ekmxrd1", "post_id": "bc08b2", "comment": "Raven Cycle by Maggie Stiefvater myb\nOr Song of Achilles by Madeleine Miller (uhhh hope i spelled the names right)"}, {"comment_id": "ekmya6m", "post_id": "bc08b2", "comment": "Ever read the psy/changeling series by Nalini Singh?

Amazon does sell them, though. \n\nIt\u2019s about a girl named Vhalla Yarl who works in the palace library in the Solaris Empire, who discovers that she is a sorcerer known as a Windwalker (meaning she can control the wind, sort of fly, and project herself out of her body invisibly to spy on others) after saving the life of the crown prince Aldrik after he was badly wounded and poisoned in the war his father the Emperor Solaris is waging against the northern kingdom of the continent to get them to submit to his rule. \n\nSince Vhalla saved Aldrik\u2019s life, they accidentally form a magical bond since they\u2019re both sorcerers (Aldrik is what\u2019s known as a Firebearer, meaning he can summon and wield flames and can occasionally see into the future in dreams), so Aldrik agrees to mentor Vhalla, and eventually they fall in love. \n\nDisasters and the emperor\u2019s hatred of Vhalla keep threatening to tear them apart, as well as Aldrik\u2019s dark past and his outward appearance (how people see him). \n\nI won\u2019t go into anymore detail so I don\u2019t spoil anything major, but if you\u2019re interested, the first book is called Air Awakens, then there are four other books called (in order): Fire Falling, Earth\u2019s End, Water\u2019s Wrath, and Crystal Crowned. \n\nHope this helps! \ud83d\ude0a"}, {"comment_id": "ekon03m", "post_id": "bc08b2", "comment": "First off I\u2019m really sorry you\u2019re going through this.

I liked Joe Haldeman's *The Forever War* a lot, too - it had a lot to say on the culture of a society permanently fighting and on the alienation of coming home. I'd also suggest *I Am Legend* by Richard Matheson - the movie didn't really do it justice, but Matheson somehow nails the feeling of paranoia and isolation that must come with being the only person you know of who isn't an awful monster. If you liked the notion of trying to re-establish a society, you might really like *The Parable of the Sower* by Octavia Butler.

Think books like Treasure Island and Dr Jekkel and Mr Hyde (RL Stevenson), work by HG Wells, Arthur Conan Doyle, and in extension Charles Dickens, who can be bleak but is definitly inspired by Picaresque literature. \n\nWhich brings me to my next suggestion, picaresque literature. Don Quixot, Tijl Uijlenspiegel en Lamme Goedzak, Gargantua and Pantagrel: they\u2019re old stories, but episodic and lack the sombreness of a lot of twentieth century literature. They use to follow the growing up of a character, in age or spirit, which you can find in Dickens as well. \nI also like The Once and Future King by TH White, about King Arthur and The good soldier Svejk, a picaresque situated in the first world war. \n\nThere is a line to all this: some of these are in a sense stories more suitable for kids, with which I mean they are plot and character driven and less so intellectual or psychological. Yet on a technical writing level, they stand out. For me, that was a solution since I used to read a lot (and I mean a lot) of \u201cheavy\u201d literature, and always skipped afore mentioned books because I thought they would bore me quickly.

I taught literature for ten years in a middle school and the novels and short stories we would read are awesome. If you can get your hands on a Mc Dougal Littel Literature book for grades 7 and 8, you won\u2019t be disappointed.

That doesn't mean every ending has to be tragic--joy is just as much a part of human experience as sorrow.  But any truly great novel is going to be filled with conflict (conflict is the fuel that energizes the story), which is inherently stressful.  One reason we keep reading is to resolve that stress--to find out what happened.  Sometimes what happens is terrible, tragic, because that is what happens, sometimes, in life.  Aristotle said (something like) the purpose of such stories is to allow us to feel that tragedy in a safe way, to experience what he called \"catharsis\"--the feeling and release of strong emotions. \n\nI know this is not what you asked, but I think, in the long run, protecting yourself from experiencing unpleasant feelings is not going to help your anxiety and depression--and this comes from someone who experiences both. I'm not saying dive into the darkest, saddest stories you can find, but if you can get yourself to read stories that express more of the fullness of human emotion--including pain and sadness--and allow yourself to feel and release those emotions in the safe world of fiction, you might find yourself becoming better able to handle those emotions in general.  It has helped me (along with medication and years of therapy, lol). It will certainly make your life more rich.  Feeling deeply is a curse and a blessing.  It would be a real tragedy for someone who feels things deeply, and who loves great literature, to cut themselves off from so much of it because they are afraid of how it will make them feel."}, {"comment_id": "f42i5bd", "post_id": "dj5b3z", "comment": "Didn't Frued, maybe someon else, say that the avoidance of suffering is the basis of all mental illness?"}, {"comment_id": "f426cla", "post_id": "dj5b3z", "comment": "Read \u2018The Road\u2019 by Cormac McCarthy.

Some portions are like reading a futuristic textbook."}, {"comment_id": "ewcfuq9", "post_id": "cnmfgt", "comment": "Some of the recommendations so far provided definitely do not fit your criteria, so beware. My thoughts on some that are thus far mentioned:\n\n* The Southern Reach trilogy distinctly falls into the category of \"weird fiction\" which fits none of what you're looking for. There are strong elements of Lovecraftian horror in its first installment, *Annihilation*, which is pretty actually solid. Then the series goes significantly downhill after that, getting bogged down in a very slow and uninteresting plot in its second installment, and an unsatisfying conclusion in its third.\n* *Ready Player One* does have some near future technology elements, but they get lost in all the '80s circlejerking going on. Thoroughly mediocre but still a fun sort of read if you like pop culture references every other breath, I guess.\n* Dean Koontz is neither hard sci-fi, nor near future.\n\nMy recommendations which attempt to satisfy your criteria:\n\n* Robert Charles Wilson writes a lot of very good, not-too-far-distant sci-fi stuff. He's great with concepts and even better with character development and beautiful sentence composition. Sometimes his conclusions leave a little to be desired, but I'm still always happy to recommend him. His best include: *The Chronoliths*, *Spin* (and the two books that follow it in the trilogy, *Axis* and *Vortex*), *Blind Lake*, *Last Year*, *Darwinia*, *Mysterium*, and I can go on and on. Seriously, read Robert Charles Wilson.\n* I'll second the recommendation of the Silo Series by Hugh Howey, which is quite good, though gets a little bogged down in the middle installment. After that, I'd check out *Machine Learning: New and Collected Stories* also by Howey, which has some really good stories in it, including a trilogy of stories following the events of the Silo trilogy, as well as a very good story called 'The Plagiarist' which satisfies your criteria well.\n* Much of John Scalzi's work is a fun read and isn't too far distant future. His Old Man's War series is quite a fun military sci-fi series, but may be too far out for your liking. However, *Lock In* may fit your criteria more, as it's a detective novel with near-future sci-fi elements. It's not as good as Old Man's War in my opinion, but to each their own.\n* Robert J. Sawyer has written a few near-future sci-fi books that you might want to consider checking out. I've only read *Flashforward* and *Illegal Alien,* but both were solid enough.\n* Daniel H. Wilson writes a lot about robots in the future, which makes sense considering he's a robotics engineer. He's known for *Robopocalypse* which is a bit like a robot version of *World War Z*. Its sequel is a little more grim and less of a fun read. However, he also has a book *Amped* about near-future neural implants which may be up your alley. Also, his short story collection *Guardian Angels and Other Monsters* was fairly solid.\n* The Expanse series is great, but may be getting into the realm of too far future for you. But it's definitely worth a read once you've exhausted your options with near-future stuff. Plus, the final book should be coming out in the next year or so.\n* Of course, if you liked the Jurassic Park books, check out the rest of Crichton's work, though don't bother with *State of Fear*, wherein Crichton goes full on right wing wingnut and insists global warming is a hoax, complete with a bunch of ridiculously misleading citations. Some of his works are starting to feel quite dated, but are still solid reads (like *The Andromeda Strain*),"}, {"comment_id": "ewch2uq", "post_id": "cnmfgt", "comment": "Basically anything by Neil Stephenson"}, {"comment_id": "ewcaa9u", "post_id": "cnmfgt", "comment": "Saturn run by John sandford"}, {"comment_id": "ewcb4dl", "post_id": "cnmfgt", "comment": "[deleted]"}, {"comment_id": "ewce3ec", "post_id": "cnmfgt", "comment": "If you google \u201cclimate fiction\u201d you will find some good books.

What starts off as a hunger games on fucking steroids end up being some of the best sci-fi I have ever read. And while I enjoy sci-fi, I'm more into alt reality and fantasy. Never been a fan of aliens and this series has nothing to do with that. The only monsters in this story is actually people. \n\nHumanity as we know it is no more. Centuries prior to the RR story, people started living and working on the moon for resources. A Color caste system was put in place because in space every set of lungs has to put in effort. Gold is the top of the caste while Red is at the bottom. They came and conquered Earth and wiped out everyone not a part of their caste system. \n\nFlash forward several hundred years and most of the planets and moons that can be terra formed have been. The Colors have been genetically altered to Gold's will. Some Colors, like Obsidian and Grey, are bred for war. Pinks are sexual slaves. Reds, Oranges, Yellows, Greens are trades people of a certain craft. Every caste holds gold up on top. \n\nThe first book is def a easy read. I found it a bit too YA for my taste at times but the sci-fi behind is really good. And then the rest of the series holds nothing back. The latest release, Dark Age, just came out two weeks ago maybe and I finally finished. So many characters died. My heart is torn bc of it. Please take it as a strong recommendation.

He teaches you about things like intertextuality, common plot structures, and symbolism.\n\nSapiens and Homo Deus (both by Yuval Noah Harari) I found very fascinating and insightful. They are about humanities past and future. It uses some more \u201cacademic\u201d language but it\u2019s not too difficult. \n\nEinstein by Walter Isaacson was another great read. It\u2019s a biography of Albert Einstein, and the physics related portions can be confusing if you don\u2019t have an understanding of physics, but I found that he does a great job of explaining it anyways. You get a thorough look into the personal life of humanities arguably most brilliant scientist, the challenges he faced, and the ways he changed the world.\n\nEducated by Tara Westover is another phenomenal read. It\u2019s about a girl raised by an extremely religious family in the mountains of Idaho. Basically it\u2019s a memoir about her journey of educating herself. Very powerful, and extremely relevant.\n\nMost importantly I would say that the best person to find a book you\u2019re interested in is you. Maybe spend an hour or so in a book store just to look around and see what you see, you might see something that catches your interest. If you run into words you don\u2019t know or aren\u2019t 100% sure of the meaning, look up the definition. If you come across an unknown word enough times eventually you\u2019ll understand it. And lastly try not to confine yourself to a genre, and don\u2019t be afraid of the classics (they\u2019re classics for a reason!)."}, {"comment_id": "etdiibd", "post_id": "cb6sb1", "comment": "Animal Farm by Orwell, Lord of the Flies by Golding"}, {"comment_id": "etdufp1", "post_id": "cb6sb1", "comment": "GOOD post question.

All his books are pretty short reads and are extremely fun and interesting turn of the 20th century sci-fi. In that same vein I recommend \"King Solomon's Mines\" by H. Rider Haggard. Short, late 19th century adventure novel. And maybe look at reading a collection of short stories and poems by Edgar Allen Poe. All these I think would introduce you to new vocabulary.

These are all short enough to read in an afternoon (Frankenstein might take two or three) and there's a ton of academic info online to help you dive into these works in a way that will definitely make you more smarter when it comes to discussing literature or even just big themes in general. \ud83d\ude1c If you want something longer, Gone With the Wind is daunting in length, but when I read it, I found myself actually laughing in a lot of places because the writing was funny when it needed to be.\n\nIf you're interested in sci-fi, I'd recommend either Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card (skip the movie though. It's horrible.) or Kindred by Octavia Butler. Both of those are science fiction books that I enjoyed and learned from, even though I'm not a big science fiction fan."}, {"comment_id": "etehxjc", "post_id": "cb6sb1", "comment": "To Kill A Mockingbird is short and easy to understand.

A woman called Whollstone discovered the secret to reviving the dead, making them frankenstein-type monsters that can follow simple instructions, perfect for war fodder, our protagonists are young children that work for the academies, they are experiments that work as a team to do special missions, each of them has their strengths (good at fighting, perfect memories, great precision, silver tounge, perfect assasin) and weaknesses (Shitty memory, shit at fighting, body malfunctions, slow reactions, etc.) But they are a specialized team created by the academy to be subtle in a world where everyone is constantly competing to see who makes the bigger bio-punk stick.\n\nA practical guide to evil:\nMedieval fantasy that takes all of the true and tired fantasy tropes like, the hero always arrives on time and the villains monologue or the villain always makes a flying fortress of death and it backfires, we see the story from the perspective of a young Catherine Foundling an orphan that one night meets the Black Knight, the greatest Villain of the generation, and the one that conquered her birthplace, he makes her an offer, dagger in hand. \nCatherine is a more pragmatic sort of character, she knows that its not possible to free her homeland from Praes occupation so she aims to join the Legions of terror and rise as high as she can to make as much as an impact as she can, quick on her feet and witty Catherine Foundling tries against all odds to cheat Providence and Fate and make her birthplace a better place for the people that inbabit it, even if it means joining the side of Evil."}, {"comment_id": "etfe9al", "post_id": "cb6sb1", "comment": "Since you have a kindle, I\u2019d recommend using [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/), which has a wide selection of free public domain works.

My dad was given the book at 16 by his father.  My father gives me the book when I\u2019m 16.  I will give it to my son or daughter when they are 16.  Need I say more?\n\n3) The Log from the Sea of Cortez - Steinbeck.  I\u2019m in a place where I am seeking answers and questions on philosophy and the interconnectedness of ourselves to the world around us.  Steinbeck\u2019s writing is helpful to me today. \n\nSo it\u2019s hard to name just one book.  I would say Douglas Adams but maybe that should be saved until you need that laughter.

Applegate. It\u2019s a powerful message about war, and an enjoyable read besides.\n\nThe Prince by Machiavelli is another good one, and very short, but to me it was like reading the diary of a sociopath so I was uncomfortable with it.

Though I haven't read it, based on the reviews of his other books, both _Foucault's Pendulum_ and _The Prague Cemetery_ involve elements of mystery and dread, while also requiring a lot of work to piece together what happened. _The Prague Cemetery_ has an unreliable narrator and it becomes difficult to parse what is even true or actually happening within the book, and the book's _raison d'\u00eatre_ is to raise issues of ambiguity and subjectivity.\n\n[_Annihilation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annihilation_(VanderMeer_novel\\)) by Jeff VanderMeer - significantly easier to read than Umberto Eco; completely different tone. This book is both mysterious and dreadful. It is also surprising and at times hard to comprehend. It belongs to the genre of weird literature, like something from H.P. Lovecraft. I read this book in a 24 hour period because I had to know what happened next; this is extremely rare for me. \n\nIt's not a book series, but the writer of the show [_True Detective_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/True_Detective) derives inspiration from weird lit, so I think the genre cultivates that \"pervading sense of tension / dread,\" and that mood tends to be underneath rather than cultivated through a series of spectacles and shocks, separating it from other works of horror."}, {"comment_id": "f1ng1k7", "post_id": "da2ghu", "comment": "It\u2019s not as much mystery as horror but check out Hell house by Richard matheson it\u2019s got that slow burn feel to it"}, {"comment_id": "f1nvyfv", "post_id": "da2ghu", "comment": "Gillian Flynn's Sharp Objects.

Probably known by most fans but worth restating. Like GoT, it's a large feudal cast of mostly morally gray characters.\n\n* The Darkness series by Harry Turtledove. Like Asoiaf, it's set in a fictional fantasy world where a big multisided war breaks out. There's a catch though: the war is a near parallel to WWII, with magic and dragons representing a fantasy version of the military technological advances made during the war.

It is set against a historical backdrop of the 12th Century English succession war knows as *The Anarchy*, and while the town and the characters that live there are fictional amalgams, the historical events and figures that appear in the story are remarkably historically accurate.\n\n[World Without End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5064.World_Without_End) (also by Follett) is set in the same fictional town about 200 years later.  It has a whole new cast of characters, a story just as epic, and is set against historical events such as the outbreak of the *Hundred Years War*, the arrival of the Black Death in Europe, and the social, economic, and political upheaval that it left in its wake.\n\nThese books are right up there among my all time favorites, with *A Song of Ice and Fire*, and *The Kingkiller Chronicle*.

It is probably more brutal of a series than GoT is and is downright horrifying at times but I can't get enough of it.\n\nIt follows multiple characters like a sorcerer, a whore, multiple members of different factions, and even some of the bad guys.  It also follows a man who is Dunyain, basically someone who was born and raised and trained to have complete control of body and emotion and who can manipulate the regular people of Earwa to his will very easily.  Men are basically children to him and the first book begins with him first venturing out into the world.\n\nBakker's prose is a lot more elegant and philosophical than Martin's so it took me a bit to get used to it, but once I did the story really grew on me and I really love how he paints a scene and the vivid descriptions and philosophical musings.\n\nI really don't want to say a whole lot more and spoil anything but I think I may like the first trilogy better than Game of Thrones even.  The quadrilogy that follows is set with a lot of the same characters 20 years or so later but I still thought there was a great ending after the first three books, although you really want to know more about the ways the different sorceries, gods, and 'other' beings' work within the world.  You get more of that in the next four books and I'll just say the series gets even more horrific and brutal as it goes on and has a crazy ending.\n\nIf you're interested the books are as follows-\n\n**The Prince of Nothing Trilogy**-\n\n- *The Darkness That Comes Before*\n\n- *The Warrior Prophet* \n\n- *The Thousandfold Thought*\n\n**The Aspect Emperor Quadrilogy**-\n\n- *The Judging Eye*\n\n- *The White-Luck Warrior*\n\n- *The Great Ordeal*\n\n- *The Unholy Consult*\n\nThere may be more books yet to come but the author has said the ending of the latest book is what he'd originally envisioned when he started the series.  If you like brutal fantasy with challenging and beautiful prose and mystery I'd give at least the first book a shot.  It's the one he took the longest to write and it's insane all the groundwork that is laid for the future books in the first one.

Despite my gripes, I think Nichols gets somethings right and the book will most likely already jive with your dad's POV and would probably be the least controversial to give him while at least helping him understand why Trump is not a normal president in one aspect.\n\nSocial Democrat/Inequality:\n\n1. **Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (and Why We Don't Talk about It)** by  Elizabeth Anderson - \" In many workplaces, employers minutely regulate workers' speech, clothing, and manners, leaving them with little privacy and few other rights. And employers often extend their authority to workers' off-duty lives. Workers can be fired for their political speech, recreational activities, diet, and almost anything else employers care to govern. Yet we continue to talk as if early advocates of market society\u2014from John Locke and Adam Smith to Thomas Paine and Abraham Lincoln\u2014were right when they argued that it would free workers from oppressive authorities. That dream was shattered by the Industrial Revolution, but the myth endures.\"\n2. **The Myth of Capitalism: Monopolies and the Death of Competition** by Jonathan Tepper - \"We have the illusion of choice, but for most critical decisions, we have only one or two companies, when it comes to high speed Internet, health insurance, medical care, mortgage title insurance, social networks, Internet searches, or even consumer goods like toothpaste. Every day, the average American transfers a little of their pay check to monopolists and oligopolists. The solution is vigorous anti-trust enforcement to return America to a period where competition created higher economic growth, more jobs, higher wages and a level playing field for all. \"\n3. **Who Owns the Future?** by Jaron Lanier - \" Lanier has predicted how technology will transform our humanity for decades, and his insight has never been more urgently needed. He shows how Siren Servers, which exploit big data and the free sharing of information, led our economy into recession, imperiled personal privacy, and hollowed out the middle class. The networks that define our world\u2014including social media, financial institutions, and intelligence agencies\u2014now threaten to destroy it.\"\n4. **Pain Killer: An Empire of Deceit and the Origin of America's Opioid Epidemic** by Barry Meier - \"In Pain Killer, Pulitzer Prize\u2013winning New York Times reporter Barry Meier exposes the roots of the most pressing health epidemic of the twenty-first century. Powerful narcotic painkillers, or opioids, were once used as drugs of last resort for pain sufferers. Purdue turned OxyContin into a billion-dollar blockbuster by launching an unprecedented marketing campaign claiming that the drug\u2019s long-acting formulation made it safer to use than traditional painkillers for many types of pain. That illusion was quickly shattered as drug abusers learned that crushing an Oxy could release its narcotic payload all at once. Even in its prescribed form, Oxy proved fiercely addictive. As OxyContin\u2019s use and abuse grew, Purdue concealed what it knew from regulators, doctors, and patients.\"I have a bunch of other books but these there are probably better for introducing a conservative to broader social issues that probably won't be solved by the market alone.

Dionne Jr., Norman Ornstein, and Thomas E. Mann (St. Martin\u2019s Press, 2017)\n\nThis book\u2014whose authors include a moderate conservative as well as a Brookings fellow\u2014looks at how to heal as a nation, both assuring the rights of others as well as looking out for the poor and middle class that feels its gotten the shaft economically. Here's a quote from their introduction:\n\n> A new economy will rise from an honest reckoning with the growing inequality and despair in many kinds of communities across our country, and also from from an effort to build on the many economic advantages the United States enjoys. It will deal with the legitimate sources of discontent felt both among Trump's supporters and in the neighborhoods and precincts most strongly opposed to him. [\u2026] We propose a *Charter for American Working Families*, a *GI Bill for American Workers*, and a *Contract for American Social Responsibility* to offer ways of improving incomes, increasing social mobility, and strengthening communities caught on the wrong end of the economy. Responding to the grievances of the working class\u2014white and nonwhite alike\u2014must be part of the response to the economic struggles of all Americans. Trump's opponents cannot engage in a false-choice argument about whether to maintain their commitment to the rights of our country's ethnic minorities or to focus entirely on the white working class. Their task is to find policies that serve the interests of both groups, and of all Americans.\n\n> A new patriotism is the alternative to Trump's nationalism. It is ironic that despite Trump's calls for \"America First,\" he has imported into American politics a blood-and-soil nationalism far removed from the United States' pluralistic and constitutional traditions. Despite the many bouts of nativism, American patriotism has always returned to a definition of national identity rooted in constitutional republicanism and democratic institutions. A new patriotism would defend our commitment to pluralism while also stressing ideals shared across all our differences. *E Pluribus Unum*\u2014out of many, one\u2014is our brilliant national motto that stresses the \"many\" and the \"one.\" [\u2026] A new patriotism would also reaffirm the United States' commitment to democratic values and renew our alliances with other democratic nations. A foreign policy that walks away from international structures that are themselves products of creative American statecraft is not a form of \"realism.\" It is short-sighted and self-defeating.\n\n> And a new patriotism requires that our country rediscover empathy as the antidote to the Trumpian division. Left, right, and center have contributions to make in the task of reweaving our nation's social bonds and in insisting that empathy cannot be selective. The injustices confronting African Americans in inner cities and rural areas must bring alive our social consciences, and so too should the anguish in declining and predominantly white communities in Appalachia and the old factory towns across the Northeast and Midwest.\n\n***\n\nLooking more at economic matters, while perhaps not fully \"democratic socialism,\" here are a few by respected academics on the problems with our current economic system and how to fix them:\n\n* *American Amnesia: How the War on Government Led Us to Forget What Made America Prosper* by Jacob S. Hacker and Paul Pierson (Simon & Schuster, 2016)\n* *Private Government: How Employers Rule Our Lives (and Why We Don't Talk about It)* by Elizabeth Anderson (Princeton University Press, 2017)\n\nThe first book, by two noted professors in economics and sociology, takes a historically informed look at how the War on Government was detrimental, but disavowing all regulation instead of focusing on *effective* regulation. Anderson's book (based on a couple lectures she gave at Princeton) demonstrates the downside to a libertarian mindset, in that the fear of governmental overreach has created a power vacuum which non-governmental *private government* (employers and the like) has filled. Specifically to his views on aid, the privatization of aid can cause unfair, even discriminatory standards to be applied, with no oversight or recourse for the downtrodden, whereas governmental aid can at least be held publicly accountable."}, {"comment_id": "esiv1mr", "post_id": "c7u2uf", "comment": "Hi!

It can be a bit technical in places, but he lays out two crucial points: (1) the purpose of common government is to decide how to spend. Governments exist to spend, not to tax, and the tax power is only incidentally a way for governments to spend money. (2) He shows how the federal tax system subsidizes business and people in a way that is not consistent with libertarianism or free market principles, and that the system is this way because Congress (especially Republicans) talk big about cutting taxes, but mostly just boost spending on special interests and pay for it with loans. Oh, and he explains how deficits are just deferred taxes, so it can't really be said that Republicans have ever cut taxes, so much as just pushed the taxes down the road. \n\nActually, ironically, even Milton Friedman makes this point about deficit spending in his popular consumption books, and Friedman was the intellectual heart of trickle down (aka fuck you) economics for decades until he died. \n\nThe second book I'd like to recommend is another one on tax policy, David Cay Johnson's *Perfectly Legal*, which is about how the rich cheat the tax system and take from people like your dad (unless your dad's net worth is above $30 million or so) more often and in greater quantities than any amount of poor people do."}, {"comment_id": "eskng56", "post_id": "c7u2uf", "comment": "Democracy in Chains\n\nA fantastic explanation of how Libertarian thought became the dominant philosophy of the GOP.

On a personal level, both books helped me transition from the psychological hell of self-loathing and hopelessness into a more accepting appreciation that melancholy is a sometimes necessary and even rewarding emotional framework through which to experience the world. Melancholy is the pleasure of being sad, said Victor Hugo. Sadness has benefits; it's patient and small, brings you into the moment (but can be entrapping), it's real, and it can hone your capacity to appreciate love and beauty, which is why so many of the most beautiful things in life are touched with sadness (see Beethoven or Miyazaki).

By the time I finished a Memory of Light,  it was months later and I was in a much better place."}, {"comment_id": "ewz2mtk", "post_id": "cqqxmb", "comment": "\"Feeling Good the new mood therapy\" by David Burns. I think most self help books are bullshit but this one is based on cognitive behavioral therapy. If you do the exercises it helps you see how depression warps your thinking.  I'm not out of the woods yet but I found this book really helpful and maybe you will too.\n\nOther than that anything written by Kurt Vonnegut. His writing doesn't quite take me out of a depressive episode, but it helps me feel things other than sadness and hopelessness. Best of luck!"}, {"comment_id": "ewzw5xm", "post_id": "cqqxmb", "comment": "Certainly three books have helped me get through depression quickly and to generally live a more emotionally balanced life.  \n\n1) A New Earth:  Elkhart Tolle\u2019s follow up to his breakthrough, The Power of Now.  The book works to make his concepts more digestible and practical; same learning, different method.  Superb.  Fosters vision and stokes hope.\n\n2) Feeling Good, the New Mood Therapy/Burns: Tho this is from the 1980s (see title) , it remains a powerful distillation and introduction to the concept of mindfulness (not called that then) and Cognitive Behaviour Therapy.  Very helpful in showing reasons for hope and to the reasons to have confidence in trying it.  Ask yourself, what are you doing right now that is working for you?  Would you be asking these questions if you were not looking to try a new approach?  \n\n3) Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life/Hayes et al:  Again, superb.  Their method refines CBT into Cognitive Acceptance Therapy (CAT). This is more of a workbook and it provides many exercises that illustrate (PROVE through doing) that greater mindfulness reduces stress, anxiety and depression.  These techniques are entirely portable and you can begin using them immediately.  You\u2019ll see it for yourself in doing the work.  After all as every psychologist/therapist says, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to do the work.\u201d  And here it is in a handy, enjoyable volume.  I often go back to it for refreshers in moments when I\u2019m not feeling too well.  It always makes me feel good, even after a quick hit of 10 minutes.  As to the exercises, you can do most of them in your head, tho they do recommend paper and pencil, that\u2019s not how I learn.  So it is very accommodative.  \n\nOthers will have many suggestions for you as well, but these three are worth you time, too.

So here is my attempt at doing so:\n\n*BM* is one of those once-in-a-decade type reads that leaves you completely dumbstruck. It's scope and depth in ~300 pages is more cavernous and dark and haunting than larger explicitly conventional attempts at horror. *BM* makes you complicit in its depiction and revelry of ultra-violence in the Wild West -- it makes you depraved and finally desensitized to the meaningless depictions of war, chaos, torture, suffering, and evil that abounds in its story. It showcases one of the greatest antagonists arguably in all of literature: the judge -- a monstrous, bald-headed man devoid of hair completely, pallid and poetically loquacious -- he verges on the supernatural and divine, quite literally the devil incarnate. And yet it is not his appearance or actions that strike terror, it is his words: \"Whatever in creation exists without my knowledge exists without my consent\". \n\nAnd despite all of this *BM* is one of the most beautiful books you will ever read. McCarthy's ability to write prose is biblically epic and approaches the sublime. Here are some examples of descriptions of the scenery:\n\n>\tThe jagged mountains were pure blue in the dawn and everywhere birds twittered and the sun when it rose caught the moon in the west so that they lay opposed to each other across the earth, the sun whitehot and the moon a pale replica, as if they were the ends of a common bore beyond whose terminals burned worlds past all reckoning.\n\n>\tIn the evening they came out upon a mesa that overlooked all the country to the north. The sun to the west lay in a holocaust where there rose a steady column of small desert bats and to the north along the trembling perimeter of the world dust was blowing down the void like the smoke of distant armies. The crumpled butcherpaper mountains lay in sharp shadowfold under the long blue dusk and in the middle distance the glazed bed of dry lake lay shimmering like the mare imbrium and herds of deer were moving north in the last of the twilight, harried over the plains by wolves who were themselves the color of the desert floor.\nGlanton sat his horse and looked long out upon this scene. Sparse on the mesa the dry weeds lashed in the wind like the earth's long echo of lance and spear in old encounters forever unrecorded. All the sky seemed troubled and night came quickly over the evening land and small gray birds flew crying softly after the fled sun. He chucked up his horse. He passed and so passed all into the problematical destruction of darkness.\n\n>\tThe flames sawed in the wind and the embers paled and deepened and paled and deepened like the bloodbeat of some living thing eviscerate upon the ground before them and they watched the fire which does contain within it something of men themselves inasmuch as they are less without it and are divided from their origins and are exiles. For each fire is all fires, and the first fire and the last ever to be. By and by the judge rose and moved away on some obscure mission and after a while someone asked the expriest if it were true that at one time there had been two moons in the sky and the expriest eyed the false moon above them and said that it may well have been so.

This let you see the story unfold from the characters points of view, and adds to your feeling of helplessness.\n\nThe other highlight would be the horror. I've seen it described as a \"slow burn.\" Stoker builds up the tension masterfully, and he lets the book go for whole consecutive chapters where nothing really happens. However, you are tortured by the fact that you can see what Dracula is doing, and see the mistakes the characters are unknowingly committing. You constantly feel the danger growing, and you're certain that at any moment something terrible will happen to one of your favorite characters.

Sure society tells you to have your shit together and start on a career path and blah blah, but don\u2019t wait until you\u2019ve worked your whole life before your back can\u2019t handle traveling anymore. If you have no children, no legal obligations, or don\u2019t have your dream job going then take off. Pack a bag and hit the road. There are lots of ways to make money legally while traveling and ways to find places to stay. During the adventure you will meet a lot of different people. All with their own unique story and perspective. Meet them, break bread with them, and share experiences with them. That\u2019s the best way to understand those who differ from you.

There is no such thing as a stereotype bad man in this world. Under normal conditions, everybody is more or less good, or, at least, ordinary. But tempt them, and they may suddenly change. That is what is so frightening about men.\"\n\nSummary: \"Kokoro\" is essentially a book about the closing of an era (in this case, the Meiji era) and the clash between modernity and tradition. Soseki writes a beautiful analysis of the relationship between feelings of guilt, love, individuality, indifference and self-loathing.

You can also read his non-fiction piece, *The Doors of Perception*, where he talks about the time he took mescaline: what he saw, how he felt, etc. It was so well-written that even the slowest moments were fascinating.\n\nThe premise of *Brave New World*:\n\n'The novel examines a futuristic society, called the World State, that revolves around science and efficiency. In this society, emotions and individuality are conditioned out of children at a young age, and there are no lasting relationships because \u201cevery one belongs to every one else\u201d (a common World State dictum). Huxley begins the novel by thoroughly explaining the scientific and compartmentalized nature of this society, beginning at the Central London Hatchery and Conditioning Centre, where children are created outside the womb and cloned in order to increase the population. The reader is then introduced to the class system of this world, where citizens are sorted as embryos to be of a certain class. The embryos, which exist within tubes and incubators, are provided with differing amounts of chemicals and hormones in order to condition them into predetermined classes. Embryos destined for the higher classes get chemicals to perfect them both physically and mentally, whereas those of the lower classes are altered to be imperfect in those respects. These classes, in order from highest to lowest, are Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Epsilon. The Alphas are bred to be leaders, and the Epsilons are bred to be menial labourers.' \u2014[britannica.com](https://britannica.com)"}, {"comment_id": "f33q6x0", "post_id": "dfe0p5", "comment": "The Brother\u2019s Karamazov (Dostoyevsky) and One Hundred Years of Solitude (Marquez).

I\u2019ve never been into romantic art mediums but I heard so much about Tolstoy and Anna Karenina I took a shot and about a quarter of the way through fell in love with it. The duel arcs of Levin and Anna and how one character peaks and another hits rock bottom for them to finally meet before each character meets their destination. There\u2019s political and sociological debates of ideas sprinkled in the novel. And the way Tolstoy describes things is second to none. Some of the most beautiful descriptions of settings and double over for characters who\u2019s souls he describes to their physical exterior is unmatched to me.\n\n\nOn the other hand is the Brothers Karamazov which I read a short time after and the intimate thoughts of characters is far more important than their physical looks. The characters are more complex in a ideological sense and is impressive when two characters come from different schools of thought clash. There\u2019s passages like the famous Grand Inquisitor (personally a fan of the chapter before it) that tells philosophical metaphors for the world today. And the final act of the book left me breathless. \n\nPersonally I love both for different reasons. I cherished Anna Karenina and it\u2019s characters  more but the Brothers Karamazov dialogue and conflicts were so much more fascinating. I\u2019m not Russian and just out of college so all my work and research was done personally on Sparknotes so I recommend both.

It also expresses it\u2019s themes simply, without necessarily hammering them in. \n\nA similar experience I had was reading \u201cThe Stranger\u201d by Albert Camus. The protagonist\u2019s thought processes and understanding can be strange, but are always understandable and usually reasonable. The whole book is written in short, to-the-point sentences that tell you everything you need to know without any filler. Often it tells you more by what it doesn\u2019t say explicitly, but you never get lost looking for the point of what\u2019s right in front of you. \n\n\u201cThe Great Gatsby\u201d has more descriptive language and longer sentence structures, but keeps a simple, rhythmic scheme that holds the novel together in a similar way. You never get lost Moving from one thought to another, because the structure from sentence to sentence is just so clean. \n\nThose are certainly my top 3, but my favorite is always changing depending on what I\u2019m themes are on my mind.\n\nEDIT: Someone already brought up \u201cSlaughterhouse 5\u201d, but that definitely belongs on this list too, for basically the same reasons."}, {"comment_id": "f33u65i", "post_id": "dfe0p5", "comment": "Aristotle and Dante discover the secrets of the Universe.

It really helped me to have a book that articulated my feelings so clearly.\n\nHere's the back cover if you want to know more:\n\n Ask any woman whose mother has died at an early (or any) age and she will tell you that her life is irrevocably altered; that this one fact forever changes who she is and who she will be. Gone is the caregiver, teacher, adversary, role model, and guide to being a woman. Often, whole parts of the mother's role transfer to the daughter; grieving can be cut short, cut off, or dismissed in order to \"keep the family going.\" A daughter's relationship with her father and siblings changes and secondary losses can be overwhelming. As adults, a great variety of relationship problems can arise as a result of this primary abandonment. Transition times in a woman's life - leaving home, getting married, having a child - bring up yearnings for guidance or company and there is often nowhere to turn. Until now there has never been a book that examines the profound effects of this loss on a woman's identity, personality, family, and life choices, both immediately and as her life goes on.  \nHope Edelman, who lost her mother when she was seventeen, searched for this book and when she couldn't find it, she decided to write it herself. Edelman went across the country speaking to motherless women of all ages, conducted original research, held focus groups, and consulted psychiatrists, psychologists, and experts in grieving. What she found was a country of women anxious to share their common experience. This brave and moving book interweaves Hope's own story with those of the hundreds of women who contacted her. In their own words they express how growing up without a mother continues to affect them in so many ways."}, {"comment_id": "ew1jzw5", "post_id": "cmahas", "comment": "Hey, man - my mom died when I was 25 (which was also just last year). As a grieving person, It\u2019s Ok That You\u2019re Not Ok by Megan Devine blew my mind. I also read Dead Mom\u2019s Club by Kate Spencer (the relevancy of this may vary - my mom died very suddenly, while Spencer\u2019s mom died slowly from cancer), and I bought (but haven\u2019t read yet) Modern Loss (about young folks getting through this shit). What I think is important to keep in mind here is how very young you & your girlfriend are. She is gonna feel bitter for a LONG ASS TIME because odds are, none of her other friends are going to be able to understand what she\u2019s going through. You\u2019re also (sorry) in this group, so it\u2019s REALLY GOOD that you\u2019re looking for resources right now, because grieving people can hold a grudge and tiny fuck ups can have long lasting implications (again, sorry!)\n\nBig takeaways: listen. Ask about her mom/remember her mom to her. One big mistake a lot of people make is thinking that it helps not to talk about the loss, but that\u2019s the opposite of helpful. Know that this will forever be on the forefront of her mind - this is not a loss a person ever heals from. You just learn to live with it - in Megan Devine\u2019s words, you carry it.\n\nIf possible, do all the \u201clittle things\u201d for her - in the immediate aftermath, her memory may be shot to shit.

But the author wrote that particular installment after his dad died. There are a lot of quotes about feeling depressed/alone, that might help you understand. I will link a few, as you won't want to read the whole series unless you're a fantasy fan.\n\nThey're from Toll the Hounds, from Malazan Book of the Fallen.\n\n\"Survivors do not mourn together. They each mourn alone, even when in the same place. Grief is the most solitary of all feelings. Grief isolates, and every ritual, every gesture, every embrace, is a hopeless effort to break through that isolation.\nNone of it works. The forms crumble and dissolve.\nTo face death is to stand alone.\"\n\nAnd\n\n\"To live a hard life was to make solid and impregnable every way in, until no openings remained and the soul hid in darkness, and no one else could hear its screams, its railing at injustice, its long, agonizing stretches of sadness. Hardness without created hardness within.\n\nSadness was, she well knew, not something that could be cured. It was not, in fact, a failing, not a flaw, not an illness of spirit. Sadness was never without reason, and to assert that it marked some kind of dysfunction did little more than prove ignorance or, worse, cowardly evasiveness in the one making the assertion. As if happiness was the only legitimate way of being. As if those failing at it needed to be locked away, made soporific with medications; as if the causes of sadness were merely traps and pitfalls in the proper climb to blissful contentment, things to be edged round or bridged, or leapt across on wings of false elation.\n\nScillara knew better. She had faced her own sadness often enough. Even when she discovered her first means of escaping it, in durhang, she\u2019d known that such an escape was simply a flight from feelings that existed legitimately. She\u2019d just been unable to permit herself any sympathy for such feelings, because to do so was to surrender to their truth.\n\nSadness belonged. As rightful as joy, love, grief and fear. All conditions of being.\n\nToo often people mistook the sadness in others for self-pity, and in so doing revealed their own hardness of spirit, and more than a little malice.\"\n\nAnd\n\n\"It was a quirk of blind optimism that held that someone broken could, in time, heal, could reassemble all the pieces and emerge whole, perhaps even stronger for the ordeal. Certainly wiser, for what else could be the reward for suffering? The notion that did not sit well, with anyone, was that one so broken might remain that way \u2013 neither dying (and so removing the egregious example of failure from all mortal eyes) nor improving. A ruined soul should not be stubborn, should not cling to what was clearly a miserable existence. Friends recoil. Acquaintances drift away. And the one who fell finds a solitary world, a place where no refuge could be found from loneliness when loneliness was the true reward of surviving for ever maimed, for ever weakened. Yet who would not choose that fate, when the alternative was pity?\"\n\n\nJust a few there, don't know if they really help with what you're looking for, but they give an idea of how alone it can make you feel to feel such sadness/depression."}, {"comment_id": "ew1nmnr", "post_id": "cmahas", "comment": "Great book recommendations.

The mourning is going to take a long time and you're going to experience a lot of it with her. It can be extremely difficult to maintain a relationship with someone when their parent dies-- they become an island or grief, and sometimes its not about how to help them feel better but how to keep yourself rowing out to meet them in their sadness and make sure that they are still living. I would also suggest checking out Caitlin Doughty's youtube page. She's a mortician who can tell you about everything related to death, the phases of grief. Swimming in a Sea of Death by David Rieff is also critical reading-- its a memoir about his own mother's death. I hope that this list is helpful for you.

It's a glitch in the system that expects someone to be there, and as such the only thing it needs (assuming no other psychological damage took place) is time to adjust.\n\nSo, in my experience, the best thing you can do is refrain from interfering. Be there, be supportive, hug a lot, be responsive, but nothing you say can fix the situation. You can make it worse though, e.g. by saying that it's not that bad or telling the other person to get a grip. You can try to distract your girlfriend but don't force it, sometimes a light joke is OK, sometimes it's not. Allowing the other person to grieve the way they see fit without any commentary is perhaps the best thing you can do.\n\nThe one exception is talking about the deceased. If you notice she's thinking about her mother without saying anything\u2014do mention her. And when she mentions her first, definitely discuss it.  It doesn't have to be anything deep, just say something about her daily life, like the way she liked her sandwiches or something.

Would you be interested in having more POV characters? \n\nDo you like having some mild romance or love triangle, or was that something you just tolerated? \n\nDid you enjoy the simplicity of the writing because it goes fast? Would you prefer shorter books like the first couple? Or did you like when they got longer and more complex, more philosophical, more descriptive? \n\nHow important is a pg or pg-13 rating to you? Would you be open to something with lots of cursing, with sexual relationships, etc? \n\nDo you linger more on wondrous descriptions, on snappy dialogue, or on exciting action? \n\nDo you want fantasy based on mythology that you already know (fairy tales, cultural tales, etc) (hp is like this...

Honestly, i felt the same way you feel now; there's just nothing out there that can dethrone the storytelling of his cosmere books. A good starter is Mistborn as it's written as a YA story following a young slave girl who practices her magic and joins a ragtag team of freedom fighters to save the world from the dark lord; ironically the dark lord saved the world a thousand years ago, and this is the end result of what happens once the hero saves the world.\n\nnote that all cosmere books are connected, even if they feature different worlds, different magic, different characters. they connect to the same universe. [here](http://i.imgur.com/tnGVDoB.png) is the suggested reading order. I generally think it's best you start with Mistborn, Elantris and [Warbreaker](https://brandonsanderson.com/warbreaker-introduction/) (free on his website, just select chapter in Navigation dropdown), before you start reading the Stormlight Archive books (which are the best in the series by far); because a lot of references and characters from the other books appear in the Stormlight series. Of course you can skip them and go straight at Stormlight, it will still be amazing, but i suggest that you at least read Warbreaker before you start with Stormlight, as it has a major role to play in the series. Personally I find Warbreaker his weakest installment in cosmere, but it's still an okay read; just don't assume the rest of his stories are anything like that one, it gets better ;)"}, {"comment_id": "eeqp8r1", "post_id": "airskr", "comment": "The Chronicles of Prydain by Lloyd Alexander!

It protects consumers from mega corporations and Internet service providers from (potentially) making major changes in how the Internet works, including (among other things) the possibility of charging users for the types of content they enjoy, rather than treating all data equally. That's a pretty big deal, and not out of the realm of possibility based on comments from ISPs, as well as a number of examples of how ISPs have already started abusing their power.\n\n> There isn't enough competition in the ISP market to go without net neutrality, and these corporations are working hard to lobby politicians into enacting laws that prevent or make it difficult for new ISPs to be successful.\n\n> For all these reasons, if we want the Internet to continue to work the way it has all these years, you should be encouraging your representatives to urge the FCC to keep net neutrality and \"Title II\" (2) regulation.\n\n> ISPs already have proven that without rules in place, they will behave in a way that can dictate how you use your internet connection.\n\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nWe don\u2019t have much time left. The Federal Communications Commissions (FCC) will vote to eliminate Net Neutrality on December 14th. \n\nIn the OP, you can put your phone number to let the U.S. Congress now that you don\u2019t want this at all.

So all you can do is give in to it, step right inside the storm, closing your eyes and plugging up your ears so the sand doesn't get in, and walk through it, step by step.

It was written an extremely long time ago, was originally a oral epic, and is one of the earliest known works in English.\n\n\"Dream of the Rood\" is an Old English lyric, written from the perspective of the cross Jesus died upon. It's considered important (at least to me) because of its history and the impact it had on Christianity, as well because it was one of the most famous poems of the Anglo-Saxon period. Anglo-Saxons were originally Germanic warriors, and in an attempt to Christianize them, a warrior Christ figure was first introduced. Later, he turns from this warrior depiction into a suffering, humanized sinner. This ushers in the ideals of Catholicism and the like.\n\n. . . and that's where Julian of Norwich and Margery Kempe come in. Julian of Norwich wrote the earliest surviving book in the English language to be written by a woman. She lived her life mostly in seclusion as an anchoress attached to St. Julian's Church. We know next to nothing about her, including her real name, prior to her becoming an anchoress, except for the fact that she became grievously ill, had some visions of Christ, and decided to write about them. Margery Kempe wrote *The Book of Margery Kempe* and was a mystic, similar to Julian of Norwich. Her book is considered by some to be the first autobiography in the English language. Kempe actually visited Julian of Norwich on a couple of occasions, and Kempe's depections are very interesting because, basically, this girl was THIRSTY for Jesus. She pioneered this idea of \"Christ as a husband.\"\n\nNone of these are particularly enthralling reads, I always found them a little dry, but I thought I'd suggest some stuff that is foundational in a somewhat unique way. After all, Christianity is the base of a lot of art, history, etc., so it's interesting to watch how some of its ideals formed through Old English literature and changed over time."}, {"comment_id": "ez9oc1b", "post_id": "d0iqea", "comment": "To kill a mockingbird"}, {"comment_id": "eza13xs", "post_id": "d0iqea", "comment": "Flaubert's Madame Bovary-- I expected a serious stuffy classic, but this book has heart.

Let me start by helping you feel a little better: don't feel bad about not having read the classics. As much as they form the basis for our current literary tropes, they aren't always \"necessary\" for English majors, and it's just as important to have a good sense of the contemporary literary scene as it is literary history. Hell, a good chunk of English/literature professors haven't read \"all\" the classics-- they have a specific area of focus that they concentrate on, and may have **no** knowledge of other fields. On top of that, if you're an English major, you're probably going to find a lot of these classics on your required reading list over the course of your college career. \n\nTo that end, one good option might be to go and ask some of the professors in your literature/English department what they **always** keep on their syllabus, and what they really wish they had space to add. Ask for their recommendations. Then, as another poster mentioned, ask some of the other students what they've read as far as classics go, and see what their favorites were. That should keep you connected to the \"pulse\" of your college's literary community and, from there, you can start to expand your tastes.\n\nHopefully this helps!"}, {"comment_id": "ezb9s5r", "post_id": "d0iqea", "comment": "The Harlem Renaissance is one of my favorite time periods in Literature.

I approach reading as a lifelong endeavour. There are many classic jewels to be enjoyed but it really takes so much time. I remember after my honours year one of my classmates got a PhD scholarship to the University if Chicago and he was happy it was good for five years because he figured it would take five years of fairly solid reading to get him through \u201cthe basics\u201d.  Pick a niche and start there. For example, you could start American but you can\u2019t read all of Steinbeck one after the other. I\u2019d mix it up with Faulkner and Morrison and Joyce Carol Oates and Keysey and Erdrich etc etc. but then I\u2019d mix it up with Dickens and Austen. There are so many Dickens books I still haven\u2019t read them but I plan to one day. George Eliot is astounding and I\u2019m glad I still have a few of hers to get through. Rohinton Mistry is like a modern Tolstoy. The Irish modern literature canon is incredible. If I have advice it\u2019s just read. Don\u2019t waste your time on Netflix. Right now I have Cannery Row, a book on personal finance, a trashy regency romance, Othello and a Norwegian crime novel on the go. I\u2019m also reading Matilda with one kid and the BFG with another (what memories! What fun!). I\u2019ve been recently delighted by random finds of French historical fiction, 1930s travel memoires and one by a turn of the century Japanese woman. All books complement and contrast each other. Also, my last bit of advice is read for pleasure. I started but didn\u2019t finish Moby Dick, Ulysses, O Pioneers and a few others including one older English monstrosity called Pamela because life\u2019s too short to suffer that much while reading.

If you\u2019re looking for early novels, \u201cRobinson Crusoe,\u201d \u201cPamela\u201d and it\u2019s Spin-offs (\u201cAnti-Pamela,\u201d \u201cShamela,\u201d and \u201cJoseph Andrews,\u201d all of which are infinitely better than the source material, but are utterly out of context without having read the original text). Also I would highly recommend \u201cThe interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equinao, or Gustavas Vassa, the African\u201d as it provides an excellent insight into the perspective of someone that is *techincally* part of the British language canon, but who was excluded from the discourse for much of the history of British literary criticism (Even though he outclasses many of their own best writers!). All in all, there\u2019s so much to read as an English Major. And this is only British work. \u201cMoby-Dick\u201d (Melville), \u201cLeaves of Grass\u201d (Whitman), \u201cUncle Tom\u2019s Cabin\u201d (Stowe), and maybe an English translation (unless you speak German) of Franz Kafka\u2019s \u201cMetamorphosis\u201d if you have the time.

They're classics for a reason, sure--but they don't get to decide who is \"well-read\" or not. Do you, and as you continue in your major, the knowledge will begin to mount up. Stay curious, be open, and you'll do just fine.\n\nWith that said, I'd bet all the \"classics\" are derivative of ancient texts anyhow--Greek and Latin mythologies + poetry, the Bible, and things like Gilgamesh. Over the years, writers got more creative with form and language. However, I'd spend more time studying the cultures these texts came from. Study your literary periods closely, and you'll understand the values and aims of the \"classics\" authors.\n\nGood luck!

They can be mixed bags but it\u2019s how I found some of my favourite works, and often some underappreciated or lesser-known works too.

There have been times that I just can\u2019t read dark or depressing things (and then other times they are all I want to read. OCD is weird!). I have some books ideas that might help. \n\nFantasy:\n1.Terry Pratchett\u2019s Discworld series is one I return to a lot. The books range from straight up funny to more profound (depending on which ones you pick). There are some \u2018darker\u2019 books in the series but it is easy to just leave them out because there is no real reading order one must go in. For laughs I\u2019d recommend the Rincewind/Wizard books or the early Witches books.\n2.Rick Riordan\u2019s books - Percy Jackson, Heroes of Olympus are also really fun.\n3. Uprooted by Naomi Novick \n4. The Priory of the Orange Tree by Samantha Shannon\n\nRomance \n1, Tessa Dare\u2019s Castles Ever After series is great, and it also shows several characters with mental illnesses making peace with themselves and getting happy endings.\n\n\nThis isn\u2019t a recommendation but I find that one of the themes I return to again and again in the books I read is that of characters overcoming problems and accepting themselves. One of the most powerful series I ever read that gave me hope when my OCD and depression was at its peak was the \u2018Wheel of Time\u2019 series by Robert Jordan. There are difficult parts in the series, but overall it is about never giving up on yourself and believing that there is goodness and hope in the world. Again, there are some dark moments in the series but imo it is worth reading. \n\nI also have some non-book recommendations ( TV):\n1. Once Upon a Time\n2. Jane the Virgin \n3. Baking tv shows like the Great British Bake Off or Nailed it\n4. Avatar: the last air bender \n5. The Dragon Prince"}, {"comment_id": "ezrrkmb", "post_id": "d1rwx6", "comment": "After reading all of your replies, I haven\u2019t felt this much support and sense of not being alone with my OCD before and it\u2019s made me comfortable enough to post on here myself.

I am sorry to hear that your sister is struggling - I have OCD as well and it can be incredibly difficult. I apologize for going a bit off your question here, but when your sister gets to a place where she is ready to read something more challenging to her triggers, I recommend \"Because We Are Bad: OCD and A Girl Lost in Thought\". I recently finished it and it is an incredible memoir about what it takes to heal while living with OCD. It was really comforting for me to read, but she might not be at the stage to handle it just yet because it goes pretty in depth on the difficulties of mental illness.\n\nIt is a great read for yourself though if you ever have any trouble understanding your sisters more irrational fears. Again, sorry that I'm going off the script but I cant help but recommend this book to anyone with OCD and the people who love them. Good luck!\n\nEdit: I just saw that your parents have difficulty understanding your sister's OCD - I would absolutely and specifically recommend this book for them!

I hope she likes these ones!!\n\nRomance:\n\nEleanor and Park by Rainbow Rowell\n\nThis one is a romance from the 80s and it's a YA book about first love. One of the protagonist's comes from an underprivileged background with a vaguely abusive stepfather but from what I can remember there's nothing explicit or graphic. [It has come to my attention (because I'm very forgetful) that the last few chapters are incredibly intense as the abusive stepfather arc draws to a climax. In this case as with the binding you should see those parts yourself to determine whether they're good for your sister or not]  It's actually one of the best romance books ive ever read. \n\nPride and Prejudice by Jane Austen\n\nA classic romance that's solely centered on the family, society and romance in 1812 England. It's very well known and for good reason. It's centered around the perspectives, thoughts and ideologies of the protagonists without delving into their mental states psychologically.\n\nThe Binding by Bridget Collins\n\nThis is an lgbtq romance, and a recent favorite. I don't get impressed by romance stories anymore, but this one really did it in for me. It's a historical fiction book which is at once both precise and vague. There's some heartbreak in the middle, and the climax involves fire and it's pretty intense, although no one gets hurt. I guess it's very suspenseful. But yup, no deaths or anything. For the most part it's just kids getting along and falling in love~ [There are some very intense mental and physical descriptions at a few points tho]\n\n\nSeries:\n\nLittle Women and Good Wives by Louisa May Alcott\n\nThese two are supposed to be read together. Although they're classics i find them very easy to read because they're about the lives of four sisters and how different they are yet how much they love each other. It's very realistic and relatable, the characters mess up, fight, make up, and the parenting is done right to the point of personal satisfaction. The girls are also quite empowered for the time. It's a vibrant pair of books. There's more books , I think four in total, but these two are the ones ive been reading over and over for the past 8 years.\nJust one warning: there's a major character death. Its not gory or graphic, but it's impact is lasting on the characters and also the reader.\n\nMalory Towers by Enid Blyton\nTHIS SERIES IS A MUST HAVE!!!! Absolutely perfect for your sister in every way! Enid Blyton books are quite safe already, but these ones are fun and diverse as well! Malory Towers is a famous British boarding school in the 1900s (can't remember the decade) and follows Darrell and her adventures therein with her many vibrant friends and younger sister, Felicity. It was continued with a spinoff series by some other author, focusing on Felicity's years, but I've stuck t9 the originals. Theres also St Claire's by Enid Blyton, also about a boarding school, but I haven't read that yet.\n\nAnne of Green Gables by Lucy Maud Montgomery\nThis series is also a must have. There's 8 books, and a total of 3 deaths throughout I think. The dark parts aren't very dark as the whole tone of the series is set by the cheerful optimism of the titular character, an orphan named Anne. Its a beautiful series. Every book is extremely special. \n\n\nHope she likes these!"}, {"comment_id": "ezpqgzi", "post_id": "d1rwx6", "comment": "Off the top of my head, I'd suggest Maeve Binchy.

Piers Anthony Xantg series are fun, easy going books. They explore a lush fantasy world and it's many interesting residents and species. Fantasy might be a good fit, actually. There are a lot of books like this. Fantasy can be very plot and world driven and less about the foibles of the characters.

Deaths do happen, but it's not to children. I, personally, found them very G to PG.  I'd suggest starting with the Witch series -- Wyrd Sisters -- or the Tiffany Aching books -- Wee Free Men.\n\nWith a similar feel, but older and more than a little dated are the MYTH books by Robert Aspirin. They're light-hearted but it's very much with a young male audience in mind.\n\nAlso, maybe try the Pern books?  Though you may want to be a bit careful with those depending on how sensitive the triggers are. In the first one, Dragonquest, the scenes early on with Gemma -- the wife of an early villain -- aren't happy; you might want to read it first to see how you think she'd take it.\n\nAlso, the Harper Hall books with Menolly -- Dragonsong -- is about a young girl who wants to be a harper. She has a gruff, curt father; it's implied that he used a belt to punish her. It's not graphic, but there are scenes of her sister helping with aftercare. She also injures her hand with a knife, but it's accidental. Again, something you might want to take a look at first."}, {"comment_id": "ezq152n", "post_id": "d1rwx6", "comment": "How about Moomins?"}, {"comment_id": "ezq6nin", "post_id": "d1rwx6", "comment": "The secret garden"}, {"comment_id": "ezq9bc5", "post_id": "d1rwx6", "comment": "* *This Lullaby* and other books by Sarah Dessen\n* Susane Colasanti\n* The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants books by Ann Brasheres\n* The Princess Bride by William Goldman\n* The Little House books by Laura Ingalls Wilder and associated spin off series\n* Gail Carson Levine's books\n* ~~The Alice series by Phyllis Reynolds Naylor~~ Edit: thanks to u/dexyrox for catching that  there are actually some heavier topics in the later books\n* The Princess Diaries by Meg Cabot\n* To All the Boys I've Loved Before trilogy by Jenny Han\n* *A Semi-Definitive List of Worst Nightmares* by Krystal Sutherland (don't be fooled by the title, it's a very funny, romantic book)\n* Jackaby series by William Ritter"}, {"comment_id": "ezqbuxc", "post_id": "d1rwx6", "comment": "The Gallagher Girls series by Allie Carter!

Told in third-person from the point of view of X, the twelve-year-old daughter. Very funny. Children's book. \n\n*The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh*, by A. A. Milne. \n\n*The Wind in the Willows*, by Kenneth Graeme. \n\nBe aware this one contains one scene of mental and emotional distress; Ratty meets a traveller and becomes inundated with wanderlust, and when his friend Mole tries to calm him down and get him to think before wandering off into the great unknown without any planning he becomes distraught for a time. I think the chapter is called The Wayfarer. Maybe check that out before you read it. \n\nThe *James Herriot* books. \n\nTrue stories about a vet in the Yorkshire dales. Some of these have death in them, usually animals, but most of them are charming and funny. Again, perhaps look for a children's collection or vet them yourself to make sure no triggers are found. \n\nRoald Dahl's children's books. NOT his adult books. I cannot stress this enough. Also maybe avoid *The Witches, The Twits* and *The BFG. Matilda* is probably a safe bet, as is *Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.* If you haven't seen the film some strange things happen to the children but they all survive. Maybe vet it. \n\nThe *Swallows and Amazons* series, by Arthur Ransome. \n\nAbout several groups of children and boats, mostly set in the Lakes District, but a couple in the Norfolk Broads and one or two yarns about adventure on the high seas. \n\nRainbow Rowell seems pretty good, and clean. YA millennial/Gen Z romances. \n\nJacqueline Wilson, a children's author. She writes about lots of different issues in a child-friendly way, so even those ones that deal with rough topics are pretty easy to get through. Perhaps vet them. \n\n*The Bookshop Girl*, by Sylvia Bishop. \n\nAbout a little girl who lives in a bookshop with her mother and brother, a strange prize, and a dastardly plan... \n\nThe *Hazel Green* books, by Odo Hirsch. \n\nAbout a girl called Hazel Green who lives in a city and is friends with the baker. The first book is about her and some other children making a float for the annual city's parade. \n\nThe *Stella Street* series by Elizabeth Honey. \n\nHenni, eleven, and her friends try to figure out what's up with their new neighbours. In a later book they go camping. \n\n*Get On Out of Here, Philip Hall!* by Bette Green. \n\nAbout a young girl called Beth dealing with day-to-day school life in America, possibly in the 70s-80s. I think there's a prequel and sequel. \n\n*Peanuts* comics by Charles M. Schulz. \n\n*Calvin and Hobbes* comics by Bill Watterson. \n\nFor television, *Miranda* and *The Vicar of Dibley* are both low-stress, funny, warm shows. One *Miranda* episode is set inside a psychiatrist's office, that's S2 Ep5. It's extremely funny and doesn't really mention mental illness; they are there due to a misunderstanding, but I thought I'd mention it anyway. \n\nThere are two *Vicar of Dibley*s that may be worth skipping for triggers. The *Happy New Year* episode done for Make Poverty History was a charity episode and shows some distressing real-life footage of poverty-stricken children, so definitely avoid that one if it's a trigger. The other one is *The Easter Bunny* in which an adult character dies. There is a character in most episodes, Owen, who occasionally makes gross and violent jokes but nothing is ever seen or done on screen.

From what I remember (i've read them a few times but it's been a few years), there's little swearing, little sex, no violence, no deaths that I can remember, and no physical or emotional abuse even. Just Becky Bloom and her crazy hijinks with her friends and family.

Nothing violent, no drugs. \n\nAnd of course everyone should read the series (and especially the first book) Anne of Green Gables.

There is death, and there are descriptions of it, but it\u2019s of animals and it\u2019s very dramatised/stylised (e.g. colt fighting stallion). There is also violence.\n\nThere are also a number of chases through mountains, with the horses fleeing for their lives, etc.\n\nBoth Anne of Green Gables (book 1) and Little Women (vol 2, called *Good Wives* in some places) contain major character deaths. If she\u2019s going to read the Anne series, *the first two or three books are the lightest*. I wouldn\u2019t recommend Books 4-7 because they deal with what we would now call mental illness.\n\nOP, has your sister tried any poetry? Light verse might be good for her to read. A.E. Stallings has some lovely, light poems.\n\nTamora Pierce: IIRC (haven\u2019t read them in decades) the first two books in the SotL (Alanna) series are okay, 3rd contains minor character death and the fourth contains major character death and a... somewhat dated villain who definitely has a mental illness (plus another sympathetic character who also has a mental illness). I haven\u2019t read the Immortals Quartet in years, but from memory, it contains less character death than SotL.\nHowever, the fourth book definitely has quite a lot of people dying (not always graphically, but still) of disease. It\u2019s hard to explain, but it\u2019s a plot point. I would avoid Tamora Pierce altogether, if I were you.\n\nThe Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett - contains mental illness.

Discusses fly-fishing, Darwin, birds of paradise, and museums.\n\n-Any Bill Bryson book. A Walk in the Woods: about trekking the Appalachian Trail. A Sunburned Country: about traveling through Australia. The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid: amusing stories from his youth growing up in the 50s.\n\n-Lab Girl: a memoir by a female botanist. Mostly a loving tribute to labs, plants, science, and her long term lab manager. There's a chapter where she discusses her very traumatic pregnancy that I would skip. The author also suffers from some mental issues that she briefly touches on (mostly in the pregnancy chapter). I'm more than willing to tell her what to skip if she's interested.\n\n-Are We Smart Enough to Know How Smart Animals Are?: A philosophical book that looks at how we determine intelligence and asks why we are determined to be the \"smartest\". Lots of interesting studies on animal intelligence. I don't remember any animal harm discussed in this book.\n\n-The Botany of Desire: looks at the most basic human desires (to eat, to drink (alcohol), to get high, to be rich, etc) and picks one plant that exemplifies that desire and how we and the plant have changed each other over centuries. Did you know that Johnny Appleseed was a real person? And that his famous apple seeds weren't for growing \"eating\" apples, but apples for making hard cider? That's the kind of stuff in this book.\n\n-Mind of the Raven: stories from a researcher who had dedicated his life to studying ravens. Some of the ravens die, as a warning.\n\n-The Geography of Bliss: a man visits all of the happiest countries in the world to see what makes them happy\n\n-The Lost City of the Monkey God: about the rediscovery of an ancient city in the jungle of Honduras.

Honorable mentions go to 1984 by Orwell and Les Mis by Hugo. Les mis is a behemoth, but its so worth it. Its an eye opener in the realms of politics and humanity. While its story reflects events two centuries ago, many of the ideas Hugo presents to the reader still remain relevant today and will almost certainly be relevant in the future. 1984 completely changed my perception on what I value in society. I would say this is the book that every single person in our day in age should read. Its dystopia shows us the consequences of an uneven balance of freedom vs security.

This deals with the unpredictable, how the seemingly inconsequential can have massive effects on the world and how we only realize after the fact. Taleb talks about how we don't always know what we think we know. It's hard to explain succinctly the impact of this book, but I felt it was a real eye opener.\n\nBrightsided- Barbara Ehrenreich. Ehrenreich goes through the history of positive thinking, and how what seems like an innocuous phrase is part of a harmful dogma that has roots in Puritanism and has been coopted by our capitalist system to make us think that negativity, questioning, and feeling displeasure with our circumstances are purely our fault. It is more than a matter of personal optimism she is talking about, but a matter of systemic subversion of our values and happiness.\n\nMother Night- Kurt Vonnegut. One of my favorites by him. Honestly, read any Vonnegut and you will walk away feeling changed. Maybe opened, maybe drained. He captures the essence of humanity with dry wit, with often comedic tellings of mankind's atrocities, and with, in the end, understanding and compassion. \n\nFactory girls: from village to city in a changing China-Leslie Chang. This book follows women from various factories in industrial centers in China. From these individual stories we see a broader narrative of industrialization in China. We see the crumbling conditions under which more people are being forced to work. We see global and local ramifications of mass production. It evoked a great deal of frustration and anger in me and has made me question my habits as a consumer.\nCatch 22- Joseph Heller. Amazing novel. It has been mentioned above but I can't recommend it enough. This is one worth multiple readings.\n\nKing Leopold's Ghost- Adam Hochschild. This is a history of the Dutch in the Congo under the rule of King Leopold. It is a gruesome condemnation of imperialism. Fantastically written, yet almost unbearable to read for the horrors wrought on these people.\n\nDemon haunted world- Carl Sagan. This is maybe a little dated but I feel like it is still a must read. Sagan is hopeful, poetic, and passionate about science and critical thinking. \n\nOrdinary Men- Christopher Browning. Although this book is about a specific battalion of Nazis responsible for killing hundreds of thousands in a polish death camp, the themes are universal. Most people are not fanatics, most people are products of their time. And yet, as we see in genocides,inequalities, and wars throughout history, we find armies of ordinary people carrying out the demands of the few in power. This book does not askus to exonerate or excuse. It asks us to examine. It asks us to question ourselves as we question these men. It is a  gripping but disquieting read.\n\nA lexicon of terror- Margueritte Feitlowitz. Again with the genocide? Yes. This book is particularly nightmarish, and has stuck with me. It details Argentina's Dirty war, a period of terror in which people were tortured, murdered, and silenced under their totalitarian regime. Feitlowitz not only details these atrocities but explores the perversion of language used by the regime against the people. The country is still struggling with the aftermath of this period and she shows the difficulty of trying to regain stability and normalcy as a society after such unbelievable tumult.\n\nThe Darker Nations- Vijay Prashad. I think this book does a great job of taking many histories from around the world and distilling them into this singular narrative without losing the individual stories. After WWII, when Imperialism was, in theory, coming to an end, the forces of capitalism and communism came to the fore. The capitalist countries were called the first world and the communist countries were the second world. In the following period communism and socialism began to gain footing in what was now considered the third world. This book tells the histories of African, South American, and Asian countries caught between capitalist and communist struggles while trying to gain independence after colonial forces left or were ousted. They were often prey to dictatorships, coups, or left hanging with no aid from the countries that had colonized them. Prashad leads us through these struggles and lays the groundwork for the current struggles around the world.\n\nI can't say my descriptions have done these books justice. They truly are must-reads. I realize too this list has a bit of a pessimistic bent. But, you know, if you don't know how things got the way they are you can't fix them. And many of these books are hopeful and looking for solutions and for healing from these darker times."}, {"comment_id": "ew67iah", "post_id": "cmmvvy", "comment": "\"Pandoras Star\"   by Peter F Hamilton.\n\nThis book blew my mind.\n\nIt opened me up to a whole new future of possibilities and perspectives, and really made me look at my life differently.\n\n\"The Magic of Thinking Big\"   by David J.

It's beautiful, moving, and hilarious all at once. Deals with acceptance, expectations, race, love, and so much more. It also frequently references works like Herbert's Dune, LoTR, Watchmen, and Barbarella. It's amazing. \n\nHard Boiler Wonderland and the End of the World, by Haruki Murakami- \n\nThis one can be pretty slow at times, but when it moves, man oh man does it move. It's very surreal, very out-there  and very, very beautiful. It explores the nature and structure of the human mind through two convergent stories, one of which deals with the covert augmentation and transport of data a la Johnny Mneumonic and so many other classics- tonally, it actually reminds me a lot of neuromancer- and the other of which details dreamreading and unicorns in the mystical Town. While not as moving as Oscar Wao, it got me in the feels. \n\nAnd for my non-fiction lovers: Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, by Yuval Noah Harari- \n\nDetails the history of humanity, starting with the evolution of Homo Sapiens in the stone age, moving through the agricultural revolution and other cataclysmic events, on to the 21st century. It's fascinating in scope and perspective, and it's incredibly easy to read given the subject matter."}, {"comment_id": "evabydb", "post_id": "ciws65", "comment": "Sirens of Titan - Kurt Vonnegut\n\nHitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy - Douglas Adams\n\nCatch-22 - Joseph Heller"}, {"comment_id": "ev9u0rz", "post_id": "ciws65", "comment": "Catch-22 by Joseph Heller\n\nBreakfast of Champions by Kurt Vonnegut\n\nFahrenheit 451 by Ray Bradbury"}, {"comment_id": "eva3r3b", "post_id": "ciws65", "comment": "The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoevsky \n\nAmerican Pastoral by Roth\n\nThe Corrections by Franzen"}, {"comment_id": "ev9t7j0", "post_id": "ciws65", "comment": "East of Eden-John Steinbeck\n\nThe Satanic Verses-Salman Rushdie\n\nHouse Made of Dawn- N Scott Momaday"}, {"comment_id": "ev9vnli", "post_id": "ciws65", "comment": "A prayer for Owen Meany by John Irving\n\nTo kill a mockingbird by Harper lee- a classic but one of my favourites.\n\nOh the places you'll go by dr Seuss.

It's a short read too! \n\nThe Laramie Project by Moises Kaufman and the Tectonic Theater Project.\nThis is a non fiction play about Laramie, Wyoming, after the death of openly gay student Matthew Shepard. It's been cut down from hundreds of hours of interviews with citizens of the town, as they recall the aftermath of Shepard's death.

If you don't think this is for you, sub in **Her Body and Other Parties by Carmen Maria Machado**, a beautiful collection of short spoopy stories.\n\n**For coloured girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf by Ntozake Shange**\n\nAn award winning play that's seen many adaptations, about life at the intersection of misogyny and antiblack racism, narratives by of and for black women. I wanted to use this final slot for a book that'll open minds to stories that have been told *for* people for so long. There are centuries of cultural narratives about what it means to be a black woman, from Hottentot Venus to mammies to the Welfare Queen, and so for me personally it's really important to find firsthand accounts to combat these ingrained racist stereotypes. \n\nBooks that similarly fit the bill: **The Inconvenient Indian by Thomas King** (I'm Canadian, and so I've been inundated with racism and euphemistic half truths about First Nations people and colonial history my whole life. This book is engaging, and surprisingly short for providing a comprehensive post colonial contact history in both Canada and the US), **Thick by Tressie McMillan Cottom** (mix between first person essays with academic sociological analysis), **Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates**, **Americanah by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie** (fiction about an African woman studying in America, but who is not African American), **The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao by Junot D\u00edaz** (multigenerational fiction about a first generation American kid in New Jersey and the Dominican Republic under the dictator Trujillo)"}, {"comment_id": "evaotkt", "post_id": "ciws65", "comment": "The Great Gatsby - F.

"ex411ff", "post_id": "cr4wf1", "comment": "The Last Apprentice/ Wardstone Chronicles series, it was the first fantasy book I ever read and it started my book reading obsession and now just over 3 years in I\u2019m at 1172 books ( I don\u2019t count any books below 200 pages although most are between 300-400 with some reaching as high as 1000) \n\nThe Dark Hunter series and the Chronicles Of Nick series marked the first time I read a two large series both set in the same world and which intertwined with each other.\n\nThe Discworld series was another one land mark series for me because it was the first series I read with 30+ books and it was the first alternate world book I read that really gave a sense of how vast this world was and how many stories where going on within it.\n\nTamora Pierces Books especially the Tortall Universe are another favourite of mine which I\u2019ve re-read atleast three times and they\u2019re also the only book series I\u2019ve ever spent over \u00a3100 to purchase ( I loved them so much I got some nice paperback box sets instead of my usual Kindle or Other online type books)\n\nCassandra Clare\u2019s mortal instrument series and all the connecting ones like the shadow hunter academy and infernal devices also number among my favourites.\n\nThe Iron Fey series was one of the first series I read which both had faeries as the central plot and made me love the story.\n\nCandace Blevins books especially the Rolling Thunder Motocycle club and The Only Human series are memorable for NSFW reasons.\n\nThe Bartimaeus trilogy is one of my all time favourite short book series.\n\nK.M Shea made me love fairy tales again with her timeless Fairytales series which linked various different Fairytales together in the same universe, and later her Robin Hood and King Arthur tales also enthralled me.\n\nThe First Law series was one of the first books I read in which no one really won and the world was just as bleak at the end as at the start, but I did end up falling in love with Logan Nine Finger\u2019s Character.\n\nThe Artemis Fowl series which I\u2019ve only recently read is a new favourite because of the fact that Artemis doesn\u2019t beat the supernatural with his own abilities like almost ever other fantasy book I\u2019ve read but instead with his sheer cunning and intelligence and I\u2019m hoping to find and read more like it.\n\nThe Green Rider is also another favourite of mine because I just love the world that Kristen Britain has created.\n\nSuzanne Wright also managed to get me hooked with her \u201cHere be Sexist Vampires Series\u201d because of the characters and also all the cool powers the vampires had which were different from just the basic vampires have magic, I also loved her Phoenix and Mercury Pack series but I\u2019ve never managed to finish her Dark in You series despite reading all three previous series\u2019s twice.\n\nThrone of Glass was my first book with an Assassin as a main character and I loved it although realising after the fifth book finished that there were more yet to come dam near killed me although the joy of finding out month later that the 6th book had come out had me re-Reading the entire series again and now making this comment I\u2019ve just found out that the 7th book came out awhile ago ( I don\u2019t keep any track when the next book in a series I\u2019ve read is coming out) so I\u2019ll be reading that soon.\n\nThe Poison Study series and the Glass series by Maria V Snyder are some other favourites for their uniqueness.\n\nThe Elemental Assassin was also another magical assassin series I read in the same time as the first two although I never did finish it.\n\nLords of the Underworld and Angels Of The Dark by Gena Showalter are among my favourite Demon related books.\n\nAnother Demon related Fave is the Demonica and Lords of Deliverance series\u2019s although they\u2019re almost the same series.\n\nThe Vampire Academy and the Bloodlines series are some of my absolute favourites loved the story there.\n\nThe Darkness rising and Darkest Power series are the first book series I read where the kids supernatural powers ( or amount of power) were the result of experimentation although being YA the experiments weren\u2019t gruesome or anything but still a favourite and an interesting read.\n\n The Charley Davidson series is the only series in which I ever paid attention to the Chapter headings for reasons such as \u201cGRIM REAPERS ARE TO DIE FOR\u201d \u201cWITH GREAT BREASTS COMES GREAT RESPONSIBILITY\u201d, \u201cIF IT HAS TIRES OR TESTICLES, IT\u2019S GONNA GIVE YOU TROUBLE\u201d, \u201cWHAT HAPPENS IF YOU GET SCARED HALF TO DEATH, TWICE?\u201d  Grim Reapers are a big part of the book later on and it\u2019s the only series that I have a list of every single chapter heading for.\n\nThe Percy Jackson and Heroes of Olympus series are another good read love how the author portrayed the Gods and Demi gods in the series.\n\nShelly Laurenstons Pride And Magnus Pack Series are some of my favourite shifter romance books because the Characters are all so unique and it\u2019s not all wolves it\u2019s even got a bloody honey badger shifter in it! along with cool hybrids.\n\nThe Icemark Chronicles are an absolute favourite because it\u2019s all action and I love the battles and the fact that I\u2019m always rooting for the Icemark, along with the fact that in ever book they triumph against seemingly impossible odds although it is a YA book series so you just know the good guys are always going to win it\u2019s still enjoyable to me at least.\n\nThe Innkeeper Series was another favourite of mine.\n\nThe Immortals After Dark series I initially disliked, came back to it nearly a year later and read ever book in the series (18 at the time I believe).\n\nThe Forerunner series is a book series set before the Halo Games and I loved it mainly because it gave me a lot of back ground on the forerunners which you never get in the Video games ( and I loved the Halo games because of it being the first FPS I played massive amounts on with my friends, got a lot of nostalgia on that game and it\u2019s the only game I have ever completed on its hardest difficulty (Legendary)\n\nAnd finally the Eisenhorn series from Warhammer 40K, it\u2019s not as bat shit insane as some of the other series in the 40K universe but it\u2019s one of my favourites ( although admittedly I\u2019m not that big of a fan of Warhammer 40K and I\u2019ve only read a couple of the series in the 40K galaxy."}, {"comment_id": "ex4174e",

The best thriller I've ever read, could not put it down.  Hit me very hard emotionally. Easily the most \"gripping\" book I've read in many years, really and truly couldn't put it down.  (and I really didn't expect to be hit that hard by it)  It's overall *really* good, and there's tons of interesting facts in it, about English history (and the routines/rituals they still do every night at the tower of London that go all the way back to the medieval era), technology (both aircraft tech and also how satellites are, or were, used to analyze data) to all sorts of other things.  But the real strength of the book is how much Clancy gets you to care about the main characters.  Many of his books are very \"gadget\" heavy, but this one was not, it's no exagerration to say that it's a masterclass of emotion and psychology.  Easily his best book, and one of the best books I've ever read.  I enjoyed it WAY more than I thought I would.  If you've never read Clancy and are somewhat skeptical of him, read this book to understand why he was such a big hit in his prime.

They're funny ... but often kind of wise in their own weird way, and include such gems as:\n\n- Maxim #1: Pillage, then burn.\n\n- Maxim #11: Everything is air-droppable at least once.\n\n- Maxim #24: Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from a big gun.\n\n- Maxim #29: The enemy of my enemy is my enemy's enemy, no more, no less.\n\n- Maxim #38: What's easy for you can still be hard on your clients.\n\n- Maxim #51: Let them see you sharpen the sword before you fall on it.\n\n- Maxim #68: Negotiating from a position of strength does not mean you shouldn't also negotiate from a position near the exits.\n\n- Maxim #70: Failure isn't an option. It's mandatory. The option is whether or not to let failure be the last thing you do.\n\nThe defaced version comes with additional commentary written in the margins on each quote by various in-universe characters, extrapolating or sharing experience with each one (or sometimes doodling pictures) while the clean one just has commentary by the original 301st.\n\nI use my defaced edition as an autograph book, asking each author I get a signature of to sign their favorite maxim instead.

Layvrle Spencer books made my heart swoon. I look back on my journals from 1992 and her books are mentioned over and over. They are exceptional. \n\nMy favorites are **Separate Beds**, ** Years**, and **November of the Heart**. The latter two are historical romance, 1917 (pre and during WWI) and late 1800s (Edwardian era). These novels are emotional, tender, and well written. I'm generally not a fan of romance and abhor overly sappy or erotica. I'm not a prude by far and yes, these novels have what I consider to be steamier sex than Fifty Shades of Grey or Sylvia Days Crossfire series. I read some of these novels again in 2012/13 and was in awe how timeless they are. They didn't feel dated despite being published in the 80s and 90s.

You could look into some hobbies or activities that will take you outside of your current routine.  Getting out of your \"comfort zone\" and working on friendships and relationships will change your current view on life. Wishing you the best. (PS- the book recommendations in this thread are great too!)."}, {"comment_id": "ezgqplo", "post_id": "d0w1k0", "comment": "I think most people here have covered the habit developing/kicking and that side of things, so I'd like to cover a side that you may not have considered.\n\nSome pornography can cause people to develop an unhealthy view towards the opposite sex (not all porn, of course, but it depends on what you're watching). Certainly, you've noticed you have an unhealthy view of sex in general. I also noticed that you said you were shy. It might help you to read some material that will help you feel more comfortable speaking with other people, particularly women.\n\nI highly recommend that you dedicate some time to consuming media created by women. Many men do not read women authors or watch women-made media at all, which is a shame! To quote the wonderful Captain Awkward, \"Works by men, with male protagonists, dominate popular culture. We all grow up on stories and messages where men go out and do great deeds and they rescue and/or win the love of women. They pursue women. They acquire women as decorative objects. If you aren\u2019t good at acquiring these objects you are a loser or a failure. These are the messages you are swimming in, and they are affecting your life.\" Why read books and consume media created by women? It will give you a conversational opener you can use with anyone! \"What's your favorite book/movie/show/song written/directed/made/created by a woman?\" You can make it a little project if you want. Also, people love when you actually read/watch/listen to something they recommend, so this can give you a great step into follow-up conversations and actually developing friendships.\n\nCaptain Awkward's blog has great dating, socializing, and all kinds of advice posts that might help you too. So there's my first recommendation for women created media!\n\n*Cordelia's Honor* \\- Lois McMaster Bujold. Great introduction to the Vorkosigan saga and contains the exploits of the fantastic Captain Cordelia Naismith. Bujold is a clever, poignant writer who has a knack for interesting characters. If you want to go for something more engineering based, *Falling Free* is another novel of hers that relies heavily on safety engineering to construct the plot.\n\n*The Goblin Emperor* \\- Katherine Addison. A book about building bridges of all kinds, political machinations, and the maneuvering of a good person in an awkward and tough situation they never wanted to be in.\n\n*Mystic and Rider* \\- Sharon Shinn. Shinn has a lot to say about friendship and love, and the people who have our back at the worst and best of times. This is heavier on the romance, but I think it might give you a good guideline on how love changes us, and how we can open ourselves to those changes even though they might terrify us.\n\n*The Steerswoman* \\- Rosemary Kirstein. Rowan is a steerswoman, which is similar to a traveling scholar/librarian, except that any question you ask her, she must answer, and vice versa. This is a very women-centric series, without at all involving romance. The plot and world are also a lot of fun to figure out!\n\nThe Broken Earth Trilogy - N. K. Jemisin. Starts with one hell of a bang! The world is ending, and here is the love, suffering, and agonizing discoveries of the people who caused it, and those that might stop it.\n\nMiss Marple mysteries - Agatha Christie. These are stand-alone books besides the true detective, Miss Jane Marple. She's a cunning, intelligent older woman who takes no nonsense and uses her knowledge of people and village life to deduce the answers to crimes. It's great to get the perspective of an older woman! Start with *The Murder at the Vicarage*.\n\n*I'll Be Gone in the Dark* \\- Michelle McNamara. The book alternates between the true crime aspect of what the Golden State Killer did, and a biographical side of McNamara's and others' search for him.\n\n*Alias Grace* \\- Margaret Atwood. Was Grace Marks a mad woman, bad woman, or something else entirely? Based on a true crime in 19th century Canada, Atwood fictionalizes and brings to life Grace Marks, renowned \"murderess\"...or was she?\n\n*Dreaming Water -* Gail Tsukiyama. The story follows Cate and her grown daughter Hana, who is suffering from a disease that makes her age three times as quickly as normal. They've established a routine as they move toward the end of Hana's life, until an old friend comes to town and interjects herself in their life.\n\n*The Handmaid's Tale* \\- Margaret Atwood. Probably one of the most referenced pieces of modern literature these past few years, the novel covers the story of a woman trapped and forced to be a \"handmaid\" in Gilead, formed by the religious right after the unexplained fall of the U.S.\n\n*Beloved* \\- Toni Morrison. An incredibly intense novel. Sethe is a former slave who is haunted, both figuratively and literally, by her past. Absolutely a must-read!\n\nThere are so many more books I'd love to list here but I am running out of time.

These books should counter what you\u2019ve been exposed to and help give insight into what women actually want and how to be good at it. \n\nIt\u2019s wonderful that you are actively working to prevent these feelings and this habit from becoming a problem.

Yes, such situations exist but it\u2019s not like it\u2019s the common thing. \nDo you actually want \u201ctons\u201d of casual sex?? Why do you feel like you are missing out?\nIt\u2019s not really all it\u2019s cracked up to be. Sex is great. It really really is. And you should never be afraid or ashamed of wanting it. But - and I\u2019ve been there, although I\u2019m no superstar with the ladies, lost my virginity at an age later than my friends, I only gained some confidence into my twenties but after my long term relationship ended I had a lot of sexual partners. Sure it was...ok and maybe filled a void but truly good sex in my opinion can only be achieved when you discover each other and build a bond with the person you are having sex with. Learning what you both like, experimenting, growing together. \nRegards the porn. That\u2019s ok too. Now you said you feel like you need to remove it from your life and if that\u2019s truly what you want then fine. But again, porn is ok. Don\u2019t be ashamed of your sex drive, your turn ons, being horny...whatever. Yes like pretty much anything, if consumed too much it can be a problem. Everything in moderation right? There\u2019s nothing wrong with watching porn and discovering what it is you like in terms of turn ons etc. \nI was once fixated on pursuing the goal of having sex.\nIt didn\u2019t really work out. Once I decided I wanted to just enjoy myself and look after myself, the sex actually followed. You need to be healthy. And once it does, it\u2019ll become easier to get again. It doesn\u2019t matter what you look like. What matters is how you feel about yourself. Focus on you, the rest will follow. \n\nPS. When I started to go to the gym and lost weight I felt better about myself and my sexual performance improved markedly."}, {"comment_id": "ezhvngm", "post_id": "d0w1k0", "comment": "12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos by Jordan Peterson"}, {"comment_id": "ezh04ez", "post_id": "d0w1k0", "comment": "50 shades of grey"}, {"comment_id": "ezh9hwy", "post_id": "d0w1k0", "comment": "How about actually banging someone and then go from there - that's the easiest way.\nTinder or something?

After retiring from crime and moving to England, she was approached by British intelligence to help out with combating certain types of crime - drugs, trafficking, prostitution - that she had opposed while running the Syndicate. That's were the novels and comic strips take off.\n\nHer friendship with Willie Garvin is entirely platonic. No sex ever.

There's a lot of subtext and mythology, and even though it's by far my favorite of the ones I've read, it's also one I'm glad I waited until I'd read a few to delve into. I'm reading The Stand right now which is also a massive book, but it's too early for me to say whether it's one I'd recommend for a starter- although I *am* enjoying it.\n\nMy suggestion is going to be *Needful Things.* It's not as scary as some of the others I've read- including the two I mentioned- but one of the things a lot of people don't appreciate about King is that part of the reason he's so scary is because he creates really well-drawn characters that you really care about- positively or negatively- and in this case there's a pretty big cast of characters. *Needful Things* is about a new antique store in town where  people buy something they really want, ranging from the mundane to the magical, but instead of money the price is playing a prank on someone else in town. The pranks get more and more extreme, and people's paranoia starts to get the best of them because they all pin the pranks on someone else, so all those small town feuds boil over until it gets murderous. \n\nIt's one of my favorite King books, but also isn't one that gets a lot of love.

It's sequel Doctor Sleep (which your reading) would be better read after reading The Shining imo.\n\n11/22/63 is a sci-fi with great elements of character development, romance, and suspense.  With one of King's best written endings in my opinion.  \n\nThe Green Mile is a creative twist on paranormal horror.  It's, as another redditor has said,  a masterpiece and one of Kings underrated works. \n\nPet Cemetary is a classic straight up paranormal horror with undertones of lessons of facing our fears of our own mortality.  \n\n\nI could go on all day with recommendations but these are the most popularly enjoyed works.

Oddly, in the movie, *The Shining*, Mr. Halloran (Scatman Crothers) is killed, but in the novel he is not.  Thus, he reappears in *Dr. Sleep* as a much older man.  There are other significant differences, too, between the movie and the book, which may be why King is said not to have liked the movie version of his work.  For example, in the movie, *The Shining*, the snowy garden maze figures prominently but not in the novel, replaced by some creepy topiaries that don't play a large role in the work.  Also, the hotel survives in the movie but not in the novel.  A relatively recent novel of King's that you might like is *The Outsider*.  It is well crafted and actually has some well drawn female characters, which is not common in King's work.  If you like a time travel story with rather long, recursive plot threads, you might like 11/22/63.  I've never regretted reading any of King's works, but like all authors, the strength of his writing is somewhat inconsistent."}, {"comment_id": "f5b990s", "post_id": "dngmya", "comment": "As you can tell by varied responses, almost all of Stephen kings popular books are excellent.

I'm only familiar with a couple of titles from your list but I am myself a fan of horror, sci-fi and thillers. Here are some books I would recommend:\n\n**The One by John Marrs**: sci-fi thiller about a world where people find their love interest based on DNA testing. Who will you be matched with? Absolute page-turner.\n\n**Heart-shaped Box by Joe Hill**: if you are into a thrilling ghost story with good characters. Joe Hill's writing is terrific.\n\n**Annihilation by Jeff VanderMeer**: scientists exploring a jungle mutated by extra-terrestrial powers. Really different and weird. Very different from the movie but both are worth checking out.\n\nThose are my personal favorite books from the past month but they are also popular best-sellers in my store."}, {"comment_id": "eyi1hgt", "post_id": "cwuci0", "comment": "I suggest you read through your shelves going from top to bottom.

I was hoping that there was a real reason that people were reading it (sex, I know, but there are a billion other romance novels), but the writing was atrocious. Characters were completely flat and although the book focused on female pleasure, Grey was a manipulative jerk who stepped all over her. The ending was supposed to be happy, but I just saw a woman who thought she stood up for herself but was ultimately overshadowed by a big rich boy with mommy issues. Closely related, Twilight. I was the biggest Twilight fan when I was younger and read all four books at age 12. I picked it up again recently and realized that there are a million logic issues (its fantasy, I know, but good writers make fantasy feel real) and again, the characters are flat. The descriptions are extensive and poorly written. They were fun when I was younger, but wow, I cannot believe that those things ever touched the NYT Bestsellers list.\n\nEdit: For the record, I hold Twilight near and dear to my heart. I had all the gear: posters, t-shirts, picture books, **the soundtracks** (still amazing), necklaces, etc. They're incredibly fun books, and they paved the mythological humanoid fantasy romance YA genre, but just not something I have much respect for now that I'm older.

It was so painful to read that it took me over a year to finish it. Luckily it was a copy borrowed from a friend, but I did feel bad for taking so long. The plot is a convoluted mess, vaguely launched from the implications in Rowling's epilogue. None of the dialog has her (rather vanilla but nevertheless pleasant) wit or charm. None of it has her minimal style. None of the plotting has the usually straightforward elegance of her HP mystery plots. It's filled with bizarre concepts like Voldemort having a secret kid with his Harley Quinn stand-in lieutenant, Harry's kid trying to save Cedric's life, and alternate universes. None of these really fit into the Potterverse, and they all left a bad taste in my mouth. No one talks like an adult (or a real human). And just when you think it should end, it keeps getting worse. I didn't understand how this book passed Rowling's inspection. Then I saw the FB movies.  \n\nNow this book almost tied with my second place consideration. I know I'm gonna get a ton of hate for this, but it's a cross between **Ready Player One** and **Name of the Wind**. Both are terribly written with amateur prose. Both are about Mary Sues with \"faults\" that don't actually impair them. Both just sound like a 13yo wrote them. Dumb names. Dumb dialog and plots with plenty of contrived situations and outcomes.

(Happy to share my full thesis as well, but I pretty much accepted that the last person who would ever read my thesis was my advisor).\n\n**Abstract:** \n\nThis thesis will explore Disney\u2019s grasp on American culture by examining the cultural\n\nimperialism that both permeates Disney\u2019s films and manifests through the Disney Corporation\u2019s\n\ninfluence on structurally enforced cultural hierarchies. Additionally, it will enable me to argue\n\nDisney\u2019s self-perpetuating role in solidifying its own hegemony. More specifically, this project\n\nwill analyze Disney\u2019s use of Once Upon a Time to perpetuate the media conglomerate\u2019s\n\ndominant ideologies. Due in part to Disney\u2019s lasting appeal, many Americans (of all ages) are\n\nmost familiar with many fairy tales in their Disney animated forms. It is no accident that the\n\nnewly prevalent live-action representations of fairy tales also appeal to this mixed-age audience.\n\nThis sweeping audience demographic, paired with the potential reach of ever-growing mass\n\nmedia outlets, has the capacity to intensely influence the gender stereotypes that have been\n\nperpetuated through fairytales for centuries. Indeed, this combination provides the largest\n\nplatform yet for the fairytale to both illustrate and influence the gender roles of a culture. What\n\nthen becomes crucial, alongside the portrayal of female characters, is their representation\n\nalongside their male counterparts. Does the active fairy-tale female put the \u2018hero\u2019 back in\n\n\u2018heroine,\u2019 or do these portrayals of independent, female protagonists actually work to solidify the\n\nstereotypes that span centuries?\n\n**Selected Books from Works Cited:**\n\n* *From Mouse to Mermaid: The Politics of Film, Gender, and Culture.* Eds.

Assault, obsession and some harsh language here and there.  \n\\- House of the Scorpion by Nancy Farmer.  This one is wild.  Dystopian sci-fi in which the main character is the son (or is he???) of a dictator who runs an opium empire.  Assassinations, disturbing visuals and fast-paced suspense keep it going.

If you\u2019re interested in smart, funny, feminist romance start with Sarah MacLean for historicals and Kristan Higgins for contemporary. I also love the In Death series by J.D. Robb. Futuristic NYC cop solves murders. The first suspect is a gazillionaire with whom she has ahhhmazing chemistry. There\u2019s like 50 in the series now but don\u2019t let that scare you, and most libraries have them to lend both in hard copy and digital.

I know a lot of people here seem to be suggesting that you stick with YA books, but I'm going to politely but strongly disagree. I don't think you should totally abandon them if that's what you like, but I don't think it's a good idea for grownups to stick ONLY to that genre. Even Ursula K. LeGuin, one of the most well known YA writers (of the previous generation at least) encouraged adults to read like adults. I don't normally like the online magazine Slate too much, [but this article is really good](https://slate.com/culture/2014/06/against-ya-adults-should-be-embarrassed-to-read-childrens-books.html). I don't mean too sound too harsh, I just hate to think about what adults could be missing because they're stuck in nostalgia-induced habits. It's extremely important to branch out and find out why the classics are considered the classics. (Anyway, I've heard people say that we're all maturing slower than past generations, and I think the tendency to read YA as adults is reflective of this. ANYWAY...I'll give some recommendations here as well:\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Don Quixote** (Grossman translation) - On its way to becoming the best books I've ever read. I've never seen anything quite this good before. (I actually [posted a thing](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/bbd55c/chapter_14_of_don_quixote_is_amazing/) on r/books about a chapter in Don Quixote that blew my mind)\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**War and Peace** \\- I know it's long. But it's not nearly as difficult as you'd think. Tolstoy writes so modern that when I was reading **Death of Ivan Ilych** I thought it was some simplified modern translation. But it wasn't; that's just how Tolstoy writes, including with War and Peace. \n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Little, Big** by John Crowley - This one is a little challenging. It's a fantasy book written in the early 1980s (I think) set in the future that feels like the past and has fairies. (Speaking of fantasy books: If you like that genre, I recommend the works of Robin Hobb. Her various series set in the Realms of the Elderlings are fantastic. You really learn a lot about hardship, regret, disappointment, and unfairness. Gene Wolfe is another fantasy writer that's also considered as good as the best of classical literature, but his stuff is very, very complex, dense, and challenging. I'd recommend starting with this **Book of the New Sun** series. LeGuin called him \"Our James Joyce.\")\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Brothers Karamazov** by Dostoevsky - If you're feeling ambitious. Yeah, this one is tough for sure. But you really do learn a lot about life, people, anxiety, guilt, and general dysfunction.   \n\n\nObviously reading more of the grown-up fun stuff is great as well, not just the classics. I'm sure you've heard of Ken Follett. **Pillars of the Earth** and **World without End** are fantastic as is **The Physician** by Noah Gordon - this was published in the 1980s and is a very long book set in the Medieval period about the life of a man who travels from England to Persia to learn how to be a doctor. It's possibly the best \"huge, fun, sweeping\" novel I've ever read. \n\n  \nI could go on...but I recommend looking around at various useful \"classical books worth the effort\" type posts; I think the Guardian has a few of these. \n\nAnyway, good luck!"}, {"comment_id": "elqugto", "post_id": "bh10jb", "comment": "Lots of great suggestions here already, just wanted to add that you might enjoy this site:\n\n [https://www.recommendmeabook.com/](https://www.recommendmeabook.com/) \n\nIt gives you the first page of a book without the title/author displayed, so it can be a really fun way to try random books without any pressure or preconceived ideas about what you're reading.

I really recommend that if you're at all interested in the darker stories about the Fae.

Would definitely recommend that.\n\nAlso gonna put in a good word for *Pride and Prejudice* \\- it has a reputation as being silly and romantic, but for a more careful reader it's full of clever (and often sarcastic) humor.

The most thematic selling point is that feeling in the latter half of the book where the future explains the past and vice versa, filling in those aspects where a person has impact beyond what they can know.

It's very experimental - there are literally blackened out pages and a name cut from the book. There's never been another book like it. \n\n*The Blind Assassin* by Margaret Atwood - This novel is a like reading a mystery; every time you think you know what is happening, a new piece of evidence slides into place until you question everything.

When I re-read it about a decade either, I was struck by a sense of sadness permeating the entire work. What once seemed in the characters like a laudable attempt to live free now felt like an almost pitiable inability to be happy.\n\nCurrently, I can't claim to consider it a \"great\" work. A part of me has come to think of it as a somewhat over-esteemed work, but it's still the first work that, for me, taught me Eliot's notion that there's merit in both a book and reader changing over the years.\n\nIt also taught me to realize - in my opinion - how often we pour so much frantic energy into chasing doomed things. Not necessarily tragic things, but things that by luck or merit are just not going to work out. Which, in that sense, reminds me of another book that's had a big influence on me, which is Don Quixote.\n\nMuch like with On the Road, DQ has been a book that's changed for me over the years, although to some extent I've always been, well, entranced by the notion (I don't recall from which critic I first heard of it) of whether the character Don Quixote himself is \"really\" insane versus is pretending to be as a way to be free within normal society.\n\nMore personally, while not a 'book' to some, maybe, but TS Eliot's The Waste Land would qualify as one of the biggest foundations of my life. It was the focus of my Master's thesis, and just in the study and consideration and analysis of it, and Eliot, I'm not sure much else has affected me as much in terms of sensing the complexity and evasiveness of who people are beneath the masks they wear and behind the voices they employ. Really Eliot's poetry and other works in general, while acknowledging his flaws, has I think made me someone who is relatively sensitive to how much people hide behind themselves, and how fragile we ultimately all are."}, {"comment_id": "f4uo32y", "post_id": "dlu05o", "comment": "The Leader Who Had No Title - Robin Sharma.\n\nThis book has helped me unlock the inner 'giver' in me.

You may have seen the 2017(?) movie (or even the one from the 1970s) which was a bit sensationalized but that's just how movies are. Some books don't translate all that well onto the screen. What I love about this book is unlike some other crime novels we don't have pages and pages devoted to red herrings. Mystery novels are really only fun when at the end everything comes together and it all makes sense but even within that frame, a lot of stories will shock you at the end by revealing that that one seemingly innocuous detail mentioned offhand in chapter one was the key to it all. Which works, I guess, but in a lot of Agatha Christie books and especially Murder on the Orient Express, every detail is relevant. The solution isn't only unknown to you because the answer is drowned in a flood of unnecessary information. Each chapter is neatly organized, the table of contents acting almost as the detective's notepad listing chapters such as \"The Evidence of the American Woman,\"\"The Evidence of the Count,\" etc. It is a masterfully intricate mystery that keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat without using any cheap tricks to do so.

So they elected not to wipe us out! But they're non too fond of us. Until of course, they finally need our \"fighting\" and more \"barbaric\" spirit to help them fight back. \n\nIt seems only humans are really good at war game-strategies and counter-strategies and actually killing large numbers of other creatures in the act of war. \n\nIn CONTRAST: all the other dominant highly intelligent aliens in this novel are highly peaceful cultures, that long ago evolved beyond barbaric ways of thinking. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nAlso, on a side note: \n\nOne of the interesting peaceful aliens in the novels is actually a plant! \n\nLike some kind of weed growing on an alien planet that you would be inclined to just step over and ignore! \n\nBut it turns out the plant has HIGHLY complex neurons and probably the most intelligent brain in the entire galaxy, and is capable of extremely advanced multidimensional thought and near instant complex mathematical calculations.\n\nYet it was only humans who finally recognized that these poor plants were actually ultra-intelligent and sentient (while other species missed it!). \n\nThus, after humans identified it as highly intelligent, the plant was connected to the rest of galactic culture with computers and implants, and became one of the most important members of the novel's equivalent of the \"Galactic Federation\". \n\nSo ultimately... the plant owes a lot to humans--reluctantly the plant has to do favors for us, and tolerate us, because while it still considers us humans as highly barbaric, and somewhat evil... on the other hand it has to admit that if it wasn't for us, and our pesky curious explorer ways, it would never have been identified as sentient, and been able to participate in galactic culture! \n\nSo the plant-super-genius creatures are not always too happy about that--of being perpetually beholden to humans and having to grant us a lot of favors!\n\n------------------------------------\n\nBut ya, you can't go wrong by reading anything by Charles Sheffield. My favorite novel of his is called: Tomorrow, Tomorrow. \n\nPerhaps others here will recall the specific novel titles involving the recruitment of the bad guys (humans!) to fight the even worse guys. \n\nSheffield was quite popular with SF fans in the 70's and 80's, and was one of the first true hard SF writers (meaning he tried to get the science as strictly accurate as possible--will still bending it a bit for dramatic effect). \n\nHe has since become somewhat forgotten, unfortunately. \n\nWhich is too bad, because his novels really don't seem outdated at all. A lot of SF from the 70's seems a bit too outdated and hasn't stood the test of time too well--so it's often hard for me to read older SF sometimes. But not Charles Sheffield's novels. A lot of his novels seem like they could have been mostly written for today's audiences!\n\nEDIT: typo"}, {"comment_id": "er80gs5", "post_id": "c0rg14", "comment": "Some of the books mentioned in this thread on Goodreads:\n\nTitle | Author | Reads | Rating | Comment\n :--|:--|:--|:--|:--\n[Worm](https://www.goodreads.com/book/title?id=Worm) | Wildbow | 4857 | 4.65 | [A-wild-comment](https://www.reddit.com/comments/c0rg14/_/er7n9cy/)\n[Bloodfever ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/title?id=Bloodfever%2B) | Karen Marie Moning | 87520 | 4.29 | [cirlyyy](https://www.reddit.com/comments/c0rg14/_/er7kw70/)\n[Red Rising ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/title?id=Red%2BRising%2B) | Pierce Brown | 191316 | 4.27 | [monkey-rat](https://www.reddit.com/comments/c0rg14/_/er72lj9/)\n[Vicious ](https://www.goodreads.com/book/title?id=Vicious%2B) | V.E.

A lot of times indy authors will do this.

Even if the library doesn't have the book you're looking for, they often can interlibrary loan it from another library and deliver it to yours for free. Some will have a small charge for it depending on where it's coming from. But more often than not, in my experience, its been free. It's also not limited to books. You can usually do this with movies and music as well.

Easily the most \"gripping\" book I've read in many years, really and truly couldn't put it down.  (and I really didn't expect to be hit that hard by it)  It's overall *really* good, and there's tons of interesting facts in it, about English history (and the routines/rituals they still do every night at the tower of London that go all the way back to the medieval era), technology (both aircraft tech and also how satellites are, or were, used to analyze data) to all sorts of other things.  But the real strength of the book is how much Clancy gets you to care about the main characters.  Many of his books are very \"gadget\" heavy, but this one was not, it's no exagerration to say that it's a masterclass of emotion and psychology.  Easily his best book, and one of the best books I've ever read.  I enjoyed it WAY more than I thought I would.

He is by far my favorite author and influenced, Tolkien, CS Lewis, Chesterton and a ton of others. \n\nActually \u201cGripping\u201d recommendations are:\n- Unbroken, by Laura Hillenbrand. A true story and one of the most insane and remarkable I\u2019ve ever heard of. I think she is the best living author of non fiction. \n- Children of H\u00farin, by JRR Tolkien. If you have read LOTR and the Hobbit it\u2019s a must read. \n- Call of the Wild- Jack London\n- The Tiger - John Vaillant\n- The Power and the Glory- Graham Greene- one of the most unique and surprising books I\u2019ve ever read.

It started out as a name mocking overly serious, dark books, and it was adopted by the people it was mocking as a name for the genre of fantasy novels about worlds where actions have heavy consequences, where good people are punished for helping others, and not all endings are happy ones.\n\nBeginner:\n\n[Worm](http://parahumans.wordpress.com) by Wildbow - A teenage girl gains the power to control bugs. Shit ensues.\n\nPrince of Thorns by Mark Lawrence - Prince Honorous Jorg Ancrath ran away from home and joined a band of thieves. This is the story about a completely vile protagonist, and his bloody climb to the top of the heap.\n\nGame of Thrones by George R R Martin - Pretty much everyone has seen the show, so I'm putting the books in beginner rather than veteran where they belong. Martin is pretty much responsible for grimdark being a thing, and as is usual with people who start trends, he's actually much lighter and fluffier than the rest of the genre.\n\nVeterans - \n\nAssassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb - Robin Hobb is actually lighter and fluffier than George R R Martin. I argue against fitting her into grimdark but grimdark authors disagree with me so I get to put one of my favorite authors on this list. The Farseer trilogy centers around Fitzchivalry Farseer, a royal bastard who at the age of 6 comes to live with the royal family, and is trained as an assassin.\n\nThe Blade Itself by Joe Abercrombie - Joe Abercrombie, in my opinion, is one of the kings of modern Grimdark. The Blade Itself is his first book. It's the fantastical Hero's Journey, but... things don't always go as planned.\n\nThe Witcher by Andrzej Sapkowski - Mathematicians know that Newton and Leibnitz figured out a lot of the same things at the same time in different parts of the world. Sapkowski and Martin are similar. Best known as an incredible series of video games, Sapkowski's Witcher books are deconstructions of fantastic tales and Polish folklore, centering around Geralt, who hunts monsters for a living. If the translation to English had been faster, Sapkowski would have been considered one of the first grimdark writers out there instead of as \"the guy from the games\".\n\nExperts - \n\nThe Darkness That Comes Before by R. Scott Bakker - In my opinion this is a jewel of grimdark. This is the best of the best. But a lot of people disagree. A kind of love-it-or-hate-it book series, Bakker's Second Apocalypse books are about... umm... stuff. Happening. That is evil. Seriously, I have no idea how to describe these books. Think Lord of the Rings by way of Spinoza, which opens with a Nietzsche quote and tackles morality, genders, cultures, and the question of free will and will occasionally have a sex scene between bodychanging demons.\n\nThe Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson and Ian C Esslemont is the doorstopper series to end all doorstopper series. The books are about a war between gods, empires, and everything else. Full of enough betrayal, terrible things, and wisecracking necromancers for anyone's fancy.\n\nA third Expert book is hard for me to think of. Probably I'm not enough of an expert - I know I never read Glen Cook's Black Company, or Tad Williams's Memory, Sorrow, and Thorn, both of which have been recommended several times. Scott Lynch's Gentleman Bastards is great, but I wouldn't put it in Experts - it's much more in the Beginner's list, or Veterans. American Gods by Neil Gaiman would work, except I think Neil Gaiman would personally kill me through the screen if I put him in Grimdark and I think it's more of a veteran read. Alan Moore's Watchmen, then, seems to be my pick. It's also not much of an Expert read, but it deserves mention for how transformative it is, and for how much the author seems to regret its existence."}, {"comment_id": "dd06pvl", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "Postmodern Literature:\n\nBeginner: Slaughter-house V, The Crying of Lot 49, If on a winters night a traveler\n\nVeteran: White Noise, Watchmen, Beloved\n\nExpert: Gravity's Rainbow, Pale Fire, Foucault's Pendulum\n\nAbsolute Madman: Finnegan's Wake (arguably modernist but I'm counting it)"}, {"comment_id": "dd0g4ni", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "Contemporary Fiction 2000-present. *Reading your way through the 21st Century*\n\nLevel 1: \n\n**The Adventures of Kavalier and Clay** by Michael Chabon *2000*\n\n**Oryx and Crake** by Margaret Atwood *2003*\n\n**Cloud Atlas** by David Mitchell *2004*\n\nLevel 2:\n\n**The Breif Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao** by Junot Diaz *2007*\n\n**Then We Came to the End** by Joshua Ferris *2007*\n\n**Room** by Emma Donoghue *2010*\n\nLevel 3:\n\n**A Tale for the Time Being** by Ruth Ozeki *2013*\n\n**Americannah** by Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie *2013*\n\n**The Sellout** by Paul Betty *2016*"}, {"comment_id": "dd123zi", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "I don't see mystery yet! \n\n\n**Beginner:**\n\n*Murder on the Orient Express* by Agatha Christie.

I'm staying clear of Hard Sci-Fi as I don't feel qualified to comment.  \n  \nBEGINNER  \n**Starship Troopers - Robert A. Heinlein**  \nA young man who joins the army of tomorrow and struggles through a war for humanity's survival. The book opens with some action and afterwards all of the sci-fi elements are explained as the main character learns about them. Should be a good intro for people unfamiliar with sci-fi tropes. Be warned though, Heinlein is notorious for challenging social and political norms, if you end up reading more of his work just know it gets weird. Try to roll with it.  \n**Player of Games - Iain M. Banks**  \nA citizen of a super advanced society leaves the comfort of home, journeys to a brutal empire of sentient gas bags and challenges them to the most complex game in the galaxy. Probably the best entry point into one of the greatest sci-fi series to date.  \n**Snow Crash - Neal Stephenson**  \nSet in a near future dystopia, the main character is a hacker and modern day samurai looking to solve a mystery. Standing in his way is one stone cold bad ass. A great introduction to some of the more far out corners of sci-fi. The book is an easy read with a great sense of humour. People new to the genre should find the tech familiar enough not to alienate.  \n  \nVETERAN  \n**Redshirts - John Scalzi**  \nIt begins as a story about the grunts aboard an Enterprise type ship who have to deal with the fact that they always die on away missions and quickly turns into a mind bending tale about parallel worlds. For those who enjoy subversive stories this one is a must. Best enjoyed after watching some classic Star Trek.  \n**The Mote in God's Eye - Jerry Pournelle and Larry Niven**  \nA look at first contact from the other side of the table. The crew of a human starship discover an advanced alien species who want the secrets of interstellar travel. But can they be trusted? Could be intimidating for beginners as much of the backdrop relies on knowledge of sci-fi tropes.  \n**Pandora's Star - Peter F. Hamilton**  \nHumans have spread across the stars by the use of portals. When a hostile alien species breaks free of it's prison humanity is in a race against time to destroy them before they become unstoppable. This book is a wedge and might be challenging if not read over long sittings. Much of the world building goes unexplained but the core conflict is gripping.  \n  \t\nEXPERT  \n**Hyperion - Dan Simmons**  \nSeven people on a pilgrimage to the deadly and all powerful Shrike share their stories against the backdrop of interstellar war. Difficult to settle into but once this book gets rolling it's a masterpiece.  \n**Dune - Frank Herbert**  \nDune is the story of a Paul an aristocrat turned messiah. But it's really about scheming. And politics. And power, religion, hatred, love, families, machines, genetics, secret societies, revenge, humans and giant sand worms. It's a tough read at first but it's a deep and trippy experience.  \n**Foundation - Isaac Asimov**  \nA story that takes place over millennia. A visionary thinker is exiled to the ends of galaxy where he establishes a society to one day rebuild the doomed empire of man. This book is the first in a seminal sci-fi series but it's very much about how individuals don't matter and that's reflected in the narrative. As such it could be difficult for a reader who isn't already deep in the sci-fi rabbit hole."}, {"comment_id": "dd0vs7q", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "Dystopians\n\nBeginner: 1984, Brave New World, Fahrenheit 451\nVeteran: We, The Handmaid's Tale, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\nExpert: Brave New Worlds (an anthology which includes Minority Report and other short dystopia stories), The Iron Heel, Logan's* Run\n\n"}, {"comment_id": "dd13wy7", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "#Transgressive Fiction\n\n*Beginner:*\n\n* [Rant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22285.Rant) by Chuck Palahniuk\n* [I, Lucifer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/66717.I_Lucifer) by Glen Duncan\n* [Lolita](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7604.Lolita) by Vladimir Nabakov\n\n*Veteran:*\n\n* [A Clockwork Orange](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227463.A_Clockwork_Orange) by Anthony Burgess\n* [Trainspotting](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135836.Trainspotting) by Irvine Welsh\n* [Naked Lunch](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7437.Naked_Lunch) by William S.

I find that Fantasy novels delve too much into themes of days past, when 'things were better' while Urban Fantasy says 'that shit is now, this monster is a metaphor and that's how you kill it.'\n\nAs for those wondering the difference between Horror, Urban Fantasy and Paranormal Romance it's broken down into two tests. If the protagonist tries to fuck the monster, it's a Paranormal Romance. If the protagonist runs away from the monster, it's Horror. When the protagonist turns to face the darkness and charges headlong into danger, that's Urban Fantasy.\n\nBeginner:\n-\n1. Jim Butcher's *Dresden Files* series - A Wizard Detective in modern Chicago solves Magic Crime. It's simple, straight-to-the-point but the author plots magnificently which is why I keep recommending it. Things that happen in book one still are relevant in book nine. The story starts as a play on film noir but quickly becomes its own thing.\n\n2. Seanan McGuire's *InCryptid* series - A family of monster hunters actually try talking to the monsters they hunt and what to do you know? It worked! Now instead of hunting monsters down indiscriminately, this family only has to deal with snake cults and some monsters that just don't get the memo. All of this gives them spare time, such as a career as a competitive ballroom dancing. These novels are just very fun in their ridiculousness.\n\n3. Scott Sigler's *Nocturnal* - A detective wakes each day exhausted with dreams of murders being committed and without fail, he heads to the latest crime scene to discover he dreamed up the murder. What disturbs the detective is that he always dreams that he's a monster. Is he some sort of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde or is there more going on?\n\nVeteran:\n-\n\n1. Jim C. Hines' *Libriomancer* series - It's a story about wizards who have the ability to pull objects from any book. The storyline is straight forward enough but the way they solve problems just shows a gigantic joy for reading. This is a book series that will help you discover other books as the protagonists solve problems from the entirety of the realm of fiction.\n\n2. Daniel O'Malley's *The Rook* - A woman wakes up with no memory amongst a pile of corpses. There is a letter in her pocket saying that she's part of a secret British organization that controls the paranormal, the people sent here tried to kill her but only succeeded in wiping her memory out. She has two choices: try to run in which case she'll most likely be branded a traitor, tracked down and executed; or try faking being her past self with the notes she left herself while trying to figure out who tried to kill her. An amazing thriller even if you're normally not a fan of Urban Fantasy.\n\n3. Genevieve Cogman's *The Invisible Library* - I just read this and I liked it, so up it goes! A woman works for an inter-dimentional library that tracks down rare books across the multiverse to add to their collection. She's just been assigned a rookie, told to go to a world with high chaotic forces that interfere with the Library's magic and when she arrives the last known person who had the book has been murdered and burglarized. To make matters more complicated, she has an associate who just wants to snap up the job to look good and the rookie is not what he seems. A fun, genre-savvy detective story told within the Urban Fantasy genre.\n\nExpert:\n-\n1. Max Gladstone's *Three Parts Dead* - This is the rare Urban Fantasy that doesn't take place in modern times but the entire tale takes place within a city. The old gods are dead, overthrown by sorcerer liches but magic comes in the form of debt and if citizens still want their miracles they'll need to find a substitute for prayer. The novel reads as a metaphor for capitalism, where instead of sorcerers doing battle on a campground, it's lich lawyers in boardrooms and acquisitions are having to convince congregations to pray to a different deity.\n\n2. China Mieville's *Perdidio Street Station* - Mieville's known as a writer's writer and this is his most accessible work about alchemy and dark pacts. Another rare Urban Fantasy that takes place in a non-modern time, the story is about an escaped monster in a Renaissance city, an sculptor trying to capture the essence of an abomination and an alchemist who has been drafted into perfecting a defense system against a monster he has no information on. What makes Mieville different is he eschews typical fantasy stereotypes, here we get Cactus-men and Khepri beetle people over the usual dwarves and elves.\n\n3. Claire North's *The Sudden Appearance of Hope* - The protagonist is an excellent thief just because if you don't look at her for a minute, you'll forget she even exists. After embarrassing a Saudi Prince, she gets caught up in a power struggle between a social media conglomerate and an anti-capitalist saboteur while trying to sell the jewels to a fence; all the while being dogged by a security team who has a picture of her on their wrists. I'll say that I liked Claire North's other works more, I think Touch is a wild ride and First Fifteen Lives of Harry August was amazing; however, in the age of social media this book has something important to say."}, {"comment_id": "dd080x7", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "Horror:\n\nBeginners: Frankenstein, Dracula, The Complete Stories and Poems of Edgar Allan Poe\n\nVeterans: Rosemary's Baby, Neverwhere, American Psycho \n\nExperts: Necrophila Variations, 11/22/63, The Art of the Deal\n\nThe last one was a joke... my third pick for that category is \"Perfume\" "}, {"comment_id": "dd43cgr", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "Fantasy Adventure:\n\nBeginner: The Hobbit, Artemis Fowl, The Graveyard Book\n\nVeterans: His Dark Materials, A Wizard of Earthsea, Stardust\n\nExpert: The Dark Tower, American Gods, The Magicians"}, {"comment_id": "delcuuy", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "**Genre: Nonfiction Books About Death**\n\n*Beginner* (The Journalists & the Essayists)\n\n* [Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32145.Stiff) / [Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14990.Spook) by Mary Roach\n* [Smoke Gets in Your Eyes](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25189315-smoke-gets-in-your-eyes) by Caitlin Doughty\n* [Knocking on Heaven's Door: The Path to a Better Way of Death](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130658-knocking-on-heaven-s-door) by Katy Butler\n\n*Veteran* (The Memoirists)\n\n* [The Year of Magical Thinking](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7815.The_Year_of_Magical_Thinking) / [Blue Nights](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10252302-blue-nights) by Joan Didion\n* [The Light of the World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22875479-the-light-of-the-world) by Elizabeth Alexander\n* [When Breath Becomes Air](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25899336-when-breath-becomes-air) by Paul Kalanithi\n\n*Experts* (The Scientists)\n\n* [Being Mortal: Medicine and What Matters in the End](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20696006-being-mortal) by Atul Gawande\n* [Modern Death: How Medicine Changed the End of Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29939201-modern-death) by Haider Warraich\n* [The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7170627-the-emperor-of-all-maladies) by Siddhartha Mukherjee\n\n*Bonus Fiction Picks*\n\n* [Mort](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/386372.Mort) by Terry Pratchett\n* [Grief is the Thing with Feathers](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25334576-grief-is-the-thing-with-feathers) by Max Porter\n* [Life after Life](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15790842-life-after-life) by Kate Atkinson"}, {"comment_id": "deifgbm", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "Portuguese redditor here, and this feels like cheating, because portuguese literature isn't a genre per se, but I truly believe these books are worth your salt.\n\nPortuguese literature (we're barely scratching the surface):\n\n* **Beginner:** *Baltasar and Blimunda* by Jos\u00e9 Saramago (assigned reading in high school, magical realism and romance against the backdrop of the Inquisition and the construction of the Palace of Mafra - it's shock full of beautiful descriptions and poetic language, albeit with almost no commas to be found, at least in the original language it reads almost like a soft stream of conciousness - but despite my description it's far from a bore); \n> From Baltasar and Blimunda: The threat of rain appears to have nothing to do with Jo\u00e3o Elvas\u2019s desire to be alone, and one must not forget that, strange as it may seem, some men can spend their entire life alone and enjoy solitude, especially if it is raining and their crust is hard.\n\n* **Veteran:** *Apparition* by Verg\u00edlio Ferreira (I read it a long time ago, but I consider him the Portuguese Sartre, a semi-autobiographical novel beautifully written); *The Double* by Jos\u00e9 Saramago (the Villeneuve film *Enemy* was loosely based on this book); *The Book of Disquiet* by Fernando Pessoa (it's basically a literary stew of different ideas by the man that invented the term [Heteronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heteronym_(literature)) - look up Ricardo Reis, \u00c1lvaro de Campos...) \n> From The Book of Disquiet: What has happened to us has happened to everyone or only us; if to everyone, then it's no novelty, and if only to us, then it won't be understood.\n\n\n> From The Double: We have an odd relationship with words. We learn a few when we are small, throughout our lives we collect others through education, conversation, our contact with books, and yet, in comparison, there are only a tiny number about whose meaning, sense, and denotation we would have absolutely no doubts, if one day, we were to ask ourselves seriously what they meant. Thus we affirm and deny, thus we convince and are convinced, thus we argue, deduce, and conclude, wandering fearlessly over the surface of concepts about which we only have the vaguest of ideas, and, despite the false air of confidence that we generally affect as we feel our way along the road in verbal darkness, we manage, more or less, to understand each other and even, sometimes, to find each other.\n\n* **Expert:** *The Lusiads* by Lu\u00eds Vaz de Cam\u00f5es (while the spaniards have their *Don Quijote*, we have our very own Homer, and this is truly the hymn of the Discoveries, a magnum opus that has ten cantos and a bucketload of stanzas). If you like Faulkner I recommend you anything by Ant\u00f3nio Lobo Antunes, particularly *The Inquisitors' Manual* and *An explanation of the birds*. \n\nIf you'd like some poetry or other authors feel free to drop me a line.

The Girl on the Train by Paula Hawkins. This book is about a woman who takes the same commuter train every day and observes a couple along the way. Until one day, things start unraveling. It deals with themes of alcoholism and cheating but it is a very easy and quick read. \n\n2. The Kind Worth Killing by Peter Swanson. It is inspired by Strangers on a Train and is about two people who meet on a flight. When Ted says that he wants to kill his wife, Lily agrees to help him. This book has a lot of twists, most of them plausible. It has an unusual ending and is also a quick read. \n\n3. The Silent Wife by ASA Harrison. This book is about a twisted marriage between a serial cheater and his wife who has her own way of coming to term with things. \n\nIntermediate:\n\n1. Books by Gillian Flynn. I love this author! Her prose is so interesting and at the same time meaningful. The books are easy to read but the way she describes characters and the subtle plot points are really good. Sharp objects is probably my favorite, followed by Gone Girl and Dark Places. \n\n2. Cormoran Strike series by Robert Galbraith (JK Rowling). This series is about a detective and his assistant Robin. The dynamic between Cormoran and Robin and her relationship with her fianc\u00e9 are portrayed very delicately. The mysteries are also decent. While the first book works well as an introduction, the second book is quite grisly and the third one is complex. \n\n3. Into the Darkest Corner by Elizabeth Haynes. This book is about domestic violence and a very unsettling relationship. It is intense and creepy. \n\nExpert:\n\n1. The Silence of the Lambs by Thomas Harris. Hannibal Lecter. Enough said. \n\n2. Dublin Murder Squad series by Tana French. Going by the writing, I would have placed this in intermediate. It is a quick read because of how engrossing the series is. Each book focuses on a new character. However, the relationships between the characters, their back stories, their own lives and conflicts are described so well that it requires a lot of thought. \n\n3. The butterfly garden by Dot Hutchinson. This one is more horror than thriller, but that's because of rape, murder etc. I had a hard time deciding a category for this. The writing isn't difficult to read, but the things being said are. I found it quite interesting although the ending was a bit of a letdown. \n\nBonus: Millennium Trilogy by Steig Larsson, You by Caroline Kepnes, Bloodlines by Ruth Rendell, The Girl Next Door by Jack Ketchum.

These books illogically evoke something within you that no other genre can, despite being weakly plotted in general. These can't really be considered as horror because they aim to mystify rather than terrify.\n\nBeginner: \n\nDracula -  Grim, foreboding atmosphere with a convincingly insurmountable foe.\n\nFrankenstein - Similar to the previous but with an emotional undercurrent, and with an enemy that has a reason for its existence, which is both a bit demystifying and thought-provoking. The good-for-everything Victor's efforts might move the ideal Victorian in you.\n\nThe Vampyre - The short length of this story makes the Lord Byron inspired villain of pedigree, who operates seemingly without cause, all the more ruthless.\n\nDr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde - More of a concept than a story; the progenitor of many works.\n\nAdvanced:\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray - A study of human nature. The title character is alluring and repulsive simultaneously (but does the former forgive the latter?).\n\nThe Phantom of the Opera - Quite the inverse of the previous entry. A tragedy. The theater setting is very attractive (you might recall a Scooby-Doo episode which pays tribute to this book).\n\nExpert: \n\nThe Hunchback of Notre-Dame - Again, similar to the previous in its themes but massive and historical in significance.

I recommend you take a look at the painting \"The Questioner of the Sphinx\" by Elihu Vedder which was on the cover of my Penguin edition: this alone prompted me to pick up the book (and it's a good depiction of the textures you might expect when you open it).\n\nThe Mysteries of Udolpho - An overdose of greenery and mountainsides and all-round quaintness with a sinister edge to it. Pretty overwhelming in its tone. Once more,  fruitlessly to not seem like a book-cover judge, I suggest viewing the painting \"Salt Cliffs on Rugen\" by Caspar David Friedrich to get a good feel of what you might expect.\n\nBonus (haven't read these yet): Melmoth the Wanderer, The Monk, The Castle of Otranto\n\nFor the sake of imagery, though I wouldn't call these stories Gothic as such, I suggest The Dark Eidolon and Other Stories by Clark Ashton Smith if you want a bizarre experience."}, {"comment_id": "de7ucxy", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "Argentinian literature.\n\nBeginners: Short stories by Julio Cort\u00e1zar, \"Bien de frontera\" by Oliverio Coelho, \"El t\u00fanel\" by Ernesto S\u00e1bato.\n\nExperts: \"El que tiene sed\" by Abelardo Castillo, \"Matando enanos a garrotazos\" by Alberto Laiseca, \"El entenado\" by Juan Jos\u00e9 Saer.\n\nVeterans: \"Inquisiciones/otras Inquisiciones\" by Jorge Luis Borges, \"Los siete locos\" by Roberto Arlt, \"Adan buenosayres\" by Leopoldo Marechal."}, {"comment_id": "dd0zjfi", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "Apocalyptic:\n\nBeginners: *Revelations and Dog* Michael Caines; *The Flood*, Maggie Gee; *Night Work*, Thomas Glavinic\n\nVeterans: *The Scream*, Larent Graff; *Grand Solo for Anton*, Herbert Rosendorfer; *Ende*, Anton-Andreas Guha\n\nExperts: *Signs of the Apocalypse/Rapture*, Christine DiThomas (ed.); *After the Flood*, P.C.

It makes you motivated, helps you deal with fear and resistance, and you'll be more inclined to live the life you truly want to live.\n\n\nVeterans:\n\n* Extreme Ownership by Jocko Willink and Leif Babin. Two legendary Navy SEALs in the special forces community, turned leadership consultants for Fortune 500 companies, they offer brilliant leadership advice from the perspective of military experience, and applied to the real world. You'll also love their podcast the Jocko Podcast.\n\n* The War of Art by Steven Pressfield, see above, while you're probably more courageous and can deal with fear better than anyone, Pressfield (a US Marine) offers practical advice on staying motivated and fighting resistance, which you may feel a lot of when returning to society. \n\n* About Face by Colonel David Hackworth. It chronicles the military career of one of the most decorated soldiers ever, and his display of leadership, courage, professionalism, discipline, all that good stuff is very impressive and while great form civilians, a veteran would appreciate it even more.\n\n\nFor experts:\n\n* In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust, again. It's so deep that every time you read it you learn something new, and gain a deeper understanding of its messages.\n\n* Ulysses by James Joyce. One of the deepest works of art in human history. Literature and philosophy professors who read it 50 times will tell you they learn new profound lessons each time they read it. Some call it \"pretentious\" with all its references to other works of art, but each reference is made for a specific reason, to portray a specific message. Literary expert Frank Delaney (rest in peace) had a podcast that went sentence by sentence breaking down the profound meaning in each sentence/phrase, it's astounding. If you're an \"expert\" of literature and/or philosophy this will be a highly enjoyable read. \n\n* Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace. Also criticized as \"pretentious\" by people who ironically think they're too superior to finish it. It has themes of addiction, loneliness, depression, entertainment and other aspects about our culture that other literature of the same quality do not discuss simply because they're much older works "}, {"comment_id": "dehssjo", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "Genre: Drama\n\nBeginner:\nWinter's Bone by Daniel Woodruff\nThe Chosen One by Carol Lynch Williams\nThe Leftovers by Tom Perotta\n\nModerate: \nMy Real Children by Jo Walton\nGone Girl by Gillian Flynn ll\nThe Road by Cormac McCarthy \n\nMaster:\nThe Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien\nI Know This Much Is True by Wally Lamb \nShantaram by Gregory David Roberts "}, {"comment_id": "dhd26n8", "post_id": "5qjcch", "comment": "I can't do three each off the top of my head, but I like autobiographies/biographies/memoirs.

Anne is an orphan who is adopted by mistake (they wanted a boy to help on the farm) They decide to keep her, and the story is her growing up getting into scrapes and making friends. It has love and romance. Gilbert Blyth was one of my first loves! :-) If you have children I recommend reading them out loud together. That was my first experience with them, my mom read them to me. \n\nLittle House on the Prairie Series by Laura Ingles Wilder. This was another series I could not put down and still reread every few years. My mom read them to me when I was little as well. In fact she got sick of reading them and told me I would have to read them myself now, which is how I started reading chapter books. Little House in the Big Woods is the first book and it is a little childish, they get better and better. \n\nIt is about the author and her family who are living in I think the 1870s and 1880s they are a pioneer family that takes their covered wagon out west. She wrote the books when she was an older woman based on her life memories of helping to settle the wild west :-). It is such a good book series, I love the fact that it is a true story about real people. \n\nThese book series are my favorites and I recommend reading them. Very good coming of age novels.\n\n Also if you read either series as a kid I recommend reading them again as an adult there is a lot of things that change reading with adult eyes and emotions.

As legend has it, God blessed the only survivor of this medieval pogrom, Rabbi Yom Tov Levy, as one of the Lamed-Vov, the thirty-six Just Men of Jewish tradition, a blessing which extended to one Levy of each succeeding generation. This terrifying and remarkable legacy is traced over eight centuries, from the Spanish Inquisition, to expulsions from England, France, Portugal, Germany, and Russia, and to the small Polish village of Zemyock, where the Levys settle for two centuries in relative peace. It is in the twentieth century that Ernie Levy emerges, The Last of the Just, in 1920s Germany, as Hitler\u2019s sinister star is on the rise and the agonies of Auschwitz loom on the horizon. This classic work, long unavailable in a trade edition, is one of those few novels that, once read, is never forgotten.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nshit sorry, its from 1959 but I'll leave it to the moderators to remove if they wish to"}, {"comment_id": "f4zqzue", "post_id": "dm6aip", "comment": "The Bible"}, {"comment_id": "ewnro31", "post_id": "cp41ik", "comment": "Hi, I'm a bot!

It's about a tattoo artist reading through a critical analysis of a documentary about a house that's bigger on the inside. The tattoo artists story is told in the footnotes, so there's three levels to it, and apart from that there's just a lot of confusion, like information that doesn't quite line up, people mentioned in the analysis as having seen the documentary who haven't actually seen it etc. Apart from the structure of the book itself is enough to set you on edge, like the cover in a lot of editions is slightly smaller than the pages, the word house is always offset or in a different colour depending on the edition etc. It's one of the most uniquely terrifying books I've ever read.\n\n*Kafka on the Shore* by Haruki Murakami (Although most of his books could count.) It's about a boy who runs away from home to escape his dad's Oedipan prophecy and ends up living in a haunted library owned by a retired singer, and on the way there he wakes up in a ditch covered in someone else's blood. It's also about an old man who can talk to cats and makes his living finding missing cats who ends up on a magical journey across Japan. There's a lot of connections between the two stories but I can't really explain it without spoilers, but it's definitely an amazing read.\n\n*The Gargoyle* by Andrew Davidson. It's a lot more straightforward than the other two and it's also, primarily, a romance, but I'm going to recommend it anyway because it reads like a thriller and it's one of my favourite books of all time. It's about a misanthropic porn star who survives a car crash with life-changing burns, and while he's in the hospital he meets a mental patient who insists they were lovers in Medieval Germany. For the whole book you're never entirely sure if what she's saying is true, and there's evidence given both ways, and because it's written in the style of a memoir it's hard to say if everything the narrator says about his own life is true or added for dramatic flare (For example there's stuff he experiences which would only have occurred by some huge coincidence or if her story was literally true). It's definitely one of those books where you'll pick up on more things the more you reread it."}, {"comment_id": "ewneq9d", "post_id": "cp41ik", "comment": "Annihilation and its two sequels by Jeff Vandermeer.

However, there are some sexual themes in it and if your not ok with that then don\u2019t read it\n\nBut other than that I highly recommend it"}, {"comment_id": "ewnmt7l", "post_id": "cp41ik", "comment": "A Scanner Darkly. \n-Philip K Dick \n\nAfter I finished it, I just had to sit awhile and contemplate my existence.\n\nBuckle up, buckaroo."}, {"comment_id": "ewnocc4", "post_id": "cp41ik", "comment": "*The Notebook* + its sequels by \u00c1gota Krist\u00f3f - nothing but mindfuck, pure mindfuck. Also interesting books. 100% recommend if you want mindfuck and to be left thinking about the book. I am rereading them currently! (Some of the content is quite unsettling, especially in the first book, and some of it is actually quite gross. It's also a hell of a downer. I don't want to go in more detail than that)\n\n*And Then There Were None* or *The Murder of Roger Ackroyd* by Agatha Christie - classic twisty detective fiction, can easily be devoured. She was so great at it; I suggest two particularly renowned ones, but her bibliography is full of them.\n\n*Revenge* by Yoko Ogawa - short story collection, some of them are mindfuck-y and some are simply disturbing or emotionally grotesque, with the connections between the stories adding some surprise. *The Diving Pool* is another brilliant one by her (three novellas), although the emphasis is less on plot twists and more on suspense and a disturbing, ambiguous atmosphere.\n\n*The Sea of Fertility* tetralogy by Yukio Mishima - you need to read all four to get actually mindfucked, but this will do the trick. Many Yukio Mishima books could meet your criteria depending on whether you want a plot twist or simply to feel unsettled/disturbed/blown away by the ending. *The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea* is a shorter and more popular one around here that I also recommend. *The Sea of Fertility* is a little denser and has some rambly parts. So if you're not sure you'd enjoy it, I do recommend starting with *The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea*, which is very much to the point.\n\n*Black Rain* by Masuji Ibuse - more of an emotionalfuck than a mindfuck, but definitely has the mindfuck/revelation element.\n\n*Ficciones* by Jorge Luis Borges or any of his story compilations - surreal in a mind-bendy way, will feel mindfucked by it, but not as much mindfuck in the 'suspense/plot twist' sense. Dense\n\n*Wolf in White Van* by John Darnielle (of The Mountain Goats) - an accessible introspective suspense-drama. Even better if you like tabletop games or grew up in nerd culture.\n\n*The Driver's Seat* by Muriel Spark - less about what happens than why it happens. If that doesn't bother you, it's a good psychological thriller.\n\nI can think of more but I really want to stop haha. Let me know if you do read any of those and would like more like them. I just wanted to suggest something new, since some of these suggestions are the ones I see in every thread. Of course, many of them are good suggestions and I hope you'll find something you enjoy to read. :)"}, {"comment_id": "ewnhspp", "post_id": "cp41ik", "comment": "/I have no mouth, and I must scream/ by Harlan Elisson"}, {"comment_id": "ewnlsql", "post_id": "cp41ik", "comment": "A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking"}, {"comment_id": "ewnldm1", "post_id": "cp41ik", "comment": "Behind Her Eyes.. super weird.

(and I really didn't expect to be hit that hard by it)  It's overall *really* good, and there's tons of interesting facts in it, about English history (and the routines/rituals they still do every night at the tower of London that go all the way back to the medieval era), technology (both aircraft tech and also how satellites are, or were, used to analyze data) to all sorts of other things.  But the real strength of the book is how much Clancy gets you to care about the main characters.  Many of his books are very \"gadget\" heavy, but this one was not, it's no exagerration to say that it's a masterclass of emotion and psychology.  Easily his best book, and one of the best books I've ever read.  I enjoyed it WAY more than I thought I would.

A one-shoed amnesiac poet with no name turns up in the burnt-out ruins of a Midwestern city that has been cut off from contact with the outside world and which is peopled with hedonists, crazies, and animal-hologram-wearing street gangs. He finds a half-filled journal and begins rewriting and reinterpreting the poems and accounts onto the blank pages. The result is *Dhalgren*.\n\nGene Wolfe's books are great, multilayered palimpsest-puzzles that don't always resolve into clear answers, but always give you more to uncover, all wrapped up in beautiful, vivid prose. I'd particularly recommend *The Fifth Head of Cerberus*, the *Soldier* trilogy, and *Peace*.\n\n*The Library at Mount Char* by Scott Hawkins. A bunch of children who were all orphaned at the same time were taken in by a man they know only as Father, who forces them to each study a particular variety of magic in a vast extradimensional library.\n\n*Axiomatic*, a short story collection by Greg Egan.

This went on literally for 15 years.  My anxiety would increase, climax, I'd have daily panic attacks, I frequently just withdrew from my life in some way, gather the pieces, get a little better, go back to \"normal\".    \n\n\nAt the age of 35, I was diagnosed with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder - Inattentive Subtype.  (Used to be called ADD).  I have an inability to control where my attention is all the time. If I'm super interested in something, I get tunnel vision - failing to notice hunger, fatigue, thirst (which makes it hard to manage your blood sugar appropriately) - if I'm not interested in something, the effort of keeping my attention on it is so mentally taxing that by the end of a work day, my brain feels like it has a sunburn.  I am forgetful.  I can walk into a room and forget why I came up there.  Most of my anxiety came from intrusive thoughts that would cause an anxiety response but I would forget them so quickly that I was left with a nameless anxiety and that was terrifying.  Every time I tried to relax, I was afraid there was something I had forgotten that might result in something terrible - my daughter's medication, the stove being on, etc.    \n\n\nAfter I was diagnosed, I started bullet journaling.  Bullet journaling is a way of rapid logging all the things I was forgetting.  It took about 6 weeks - at first I actually felt more anxious - but I started learning to trust that if I'd forgotten something, I can refer back to the journal.  I'm not making stupid mistakes anymore like leaving my car unlocked.  I was able to figure out that it mattered what time of day I consumed caffeine.  I stopped forgetting to take my asthma medication (mostly).  \n\nYou can use it for goal planning, you can use it for marking progress, breaking things down in to little pieces, habit tracking, all kinds of things.  People use it for helping them stay sober during substance abuse recovery, people use it for managing a cognitive behavioral therapy practice.  It's a great outlet for creativity - I sketch in mine, note down thoughts, I color coded everything so it's bright.\n\nI don't know what your \"mistakes\" are - but bullet journaling might help you understand what leads to your mistakes, help you learn from them, let you note down a specific response to mitigating your mistakes.\n\nAnd also please reach out for professional help - self-help books have limitations.  There's a reason we don't do self-surgery."}, {"comment_id": "exl2cln", "post_id": "cthson", "comment": "Acceptance and Commitment Therapy workbook by Steven Hayes.

It\u2019s more of guidance in how to think within your lifestyle. You can keep your religion, or lack of religion, and still follow Buddhist ideas.  And it\u2019s simply about thinking clearly and reducing stress and suffering.  \n\nThe basic idea:  life is hard;  that is because we expect life to be a certain way and hope for the best.

I\u2019ve also heard NSR, NLP, Reiki and hypnosis can be good for this. On another level you might decide on a spiritual purification that can help with any spirit interference which it could be. Sukyo Mahikari is a group who offer free sessions. \nSometimes it\u2019s not an intellectual issue but a follow your gut issue and your situation may not be able to change without tuning into yourself better and the best way to do this is by letting go of baggage that\u2019s slowing you down.

Hope they are translated) but I can recommend books with psychological topics that helped me through rough times and every time I think about them - or talk about them - I just keep smiling and feeling myself strong. Basically, books from Daniel Keyes. My all-time favourite is The Minds of Billy Milligan but Flower for Algernon is another remarkable and beautifully written book by him. Also, I suggest a lot of animational movies that can help you change your point of view on life, on people, and yourself! If you watch them with joy and a bit analytically, you'll find deeper meanings that can help you (WALL-E, Inside Out, UP!, The Hunchback of N\u00f4tre Dame, Brother Bear, Spirit, Finding Nemo etc.) and also movies and series (from series I really recommend Once Upon A Time.

Changing your closet, your hairstyle, your room, starting a new hobby, trying out things that you were afraid of, anything really. Honestly, you can read or watch or to do anything that you like and find joy in it. Every book and movie/series has something to teach, you just have to find those that you really like/love and reflects your deepest feelings. You're not alone! If you really feel yourself in a dark place you can go to a psychologist, it does help! You take as many sessions as you want, nobody forces you. You will tell the things you want and feel, whenever you are ready. I honestly wish you well and I know that you'll get through this! If you want to talk, I'm here, even if I'm a stranger.

Because these are different than his other stories. Short fiction by its very nature requires that you make every sentence count because you have a limited number of pages to write it which IMO greatly improves Sanderson's writing. While most people haven't even heard of it I'd say *Emperor's Soul* is his best work. \n\nShort fiction in general sounds like what you are looking for. Unless you are willing to read cookie cutter urban fantasy where everyone writes the same thing in longer fantasy you are going to end up with at least some kind of info dump and large cast of characters. The only two exceptions I can think of are the King Killer Chronicles and the Realm of the Elderlings which both have a single first person POV.

Set in an alternate turn-of-the-century Britain where a ruling class of magicians summons demons of varying power levels to do their bidding.\n* His Dark Materials by Philip Pullman. It's legendary in the genre for a reason.\n* The Chronicles of Faerie by O.R. Melling (first book: The Hunter's Moon). Set in modern-day Ireland, steeped in Irish mythology.\n* anything in the Discworld series, if such it can be called, by Terry Pratchett\n* The Half-Made World by Felix Gilman\n* Sea Change by S.M.

I learned about slavery in school, but never to the real and deep extent that this book delves into, and it has been absolutely eye-opening. Shattered a lot of myths I was taught about slavery growing up.  \n  \nFirstly, she narrates it not as some sort of withdrawn historical account of dates and charts, but rather by chronologically compiling the personal diaries and records of people who were directly involved in the slave trade - Portuguese diplomatic memos, slave ship captain's logs, plantation owners' journals, court documents, and the occasional autobiography of the rare slave or freedman who could write. So it's an incredibly engrossing narrative with a story arc told across dozens of \"characters\" who actually lived through and witnessed the horror.  \n  \nAnd what I was taught in school about slavery was \"this is bad\" without going into much detail about it, catered to children who are not ready to hear the worst of it, but The Great Stain's narrative style makes it so personal and real. Slavery becomes less of an ephemeral 'thing that happened' in a dry history book and more recognizable for the massive human suffering it involved, i.e. that victims of enslavement of every generation resisted in every way they could at every single step of the process, and that slavery thus necessitated a sweeping regime of mass torture and terrorism and its legal enshrinement that took place every single day across every last aspect of white society for no less than 300 years."}, {"comment_id": "elv3q0s", "post_id": "bhldh5", "comment": "Ronald Takaki\u2019s  A Different Mirror is phenomenal!

Baptist\n\nAt face value this may sound like a dense or boring subject, but this book was completely engrossing to read and I couldn't stop thinking about it afterward. It discusses the massive role slavery played in shaping the United State's economic system and growth into a financial superpower. It powerfully illustrates how economic interests were the driver behind decades of ideology, political thought, war, and social change in this country. It explained to me for the first time that made any sense how ownership and torture of human beings became so justified and widely accepted- and made it shockingly clear how little dissent there was from white America for many decades until abolishing slavery became financially and politically adventageous. The author dove deep into original sources like plantation records, newspapers, and narratives from people who were enslaved (or otherwise involved in the trade) to piece together how and why things occurred the way they did. I was especially moved by the detailed accounts of the experiences of enslaved people and the overlooked innovations and contributions they made that have been excluded from the historic narrative in this country. Nothing in this book is glossed over.

But the premise of the trilogy is still one of my favorite ways to make a creative fiction take on historical events. The series takes place in the events over WW1 (the great war) where the Austrian Archduke gets killed. The world setting is where the Axis powers are called 'Clankers' and have more steam punk technology and the Allies are 'Darwinists' and have these creatures they've created kind of DNA splicing style (iirc?).
